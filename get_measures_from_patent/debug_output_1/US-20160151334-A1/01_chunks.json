    "ignificantly inhibited tyrosine kinase activity at 400 \u03bcM, with an inhibition rate of 40.2%, while all compounds of the examples of the present disclosure showed strong inhibition on tyrosine kinase activity at the same concentration, with an inhibition rate above 45%, which are comparable with or superior over the positive control drug, indicating that these compounds may potentially prevent and treat tumors with high expression of tyrosine kinase.</p>Experimental Example 2In Vitro Antitumor Activity of 2-Indolone Derivatives of the Present DisclosureMethod: 14 cell lines (MKN-45 cells, MHCC97-L cells, MHCC97-H cells, HLE cells, HepG2 cells, 7721 cells, L02 cells, A375 cells, H460 cells, A549 cells, SK-N-SH cells, MCF-7 cells, K562 cells, and Ba/F3-Tpr-Met cells (pre-B cells which are malignantly transformed by the c-Met constitutive active mutant Tpr-Met) were seeded into 96-well plate at 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells/well, and each well was added with 150 \u03bcl DMEM medium (purchased from Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (purchased from Hyclone). When cell adherent was observed, different concentrations of 2-indolone derivatives (concentrations at 0.1-10 \u03bcM) were added, in addition to the negative control (vehicle control group) and blank control (medium group). After culture at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 72 hours, MTS reagent (Promega Corporation) were added for further culture for 2-4 h. OD values were detected with microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm, and IC50 (a concentration of the compound at which the inhibition rate of cell proliferation reaches 50%) was calculated with software SPSS.</p>The results were shown in Table 2 (IC50 (\u03bcM) indicates a concentration of the compound at which the inhibition rate of cell proliferation reaches 50%). Except that the compounds barely affected the proliferation of normal liver cell L02, they showed significant inhibition on the other tumor cell lines, suggesting that 2-indolone derivatives of the present disclosure have significant in vitro anti-tumor activity and have no adverse effect on normal cells.</p>TABLE 2In vitro antitumor activity of 2-indolonederivatives of the present disclosureIC50 (\u03bcM)IndoIndoIndoIndoIndoCell lineTissue origin12345MKN-45Gastric cancer1.972.131.290.941.549MHCC97-Lhepatocellular1.541.871.110.641.206cancerMHCC97-Hhepatocellular1.381.670.820.541.029cancerH460Lung cancer1.541.781.050.781.067HLEhepatocellular6.316.7924.723.585.228cancerHepG2hepatocellular6.476.9824.793.695.665cancerA375Skin cancer3.182.4761.470.971.873MCF-7Breast cancer1.721.9530.961.461.281A549Lung cancer2.893.1561.542.322.193SK-N-SHNeuroblastoma1.351.7930.850.541.187K562Leukemia3.023.2672.071.342.583L02hepatic cells24.7723.6922.1926.7720.88Ba/F3-Tpr-MetPre-B cell5.315.933.872.544.791IC50 (\u03bcM)IndoIndoIndoIndoCell lineTissue origin6789MKN-45Gastric cancer1.381.132.021.72MHCC97-Lhepatocellular1.060.971.681.31cancerMHCC97-Hhepatocellular0.910.691.531.17cancerH460Lung cancer0.940.921.631.25HLEhepatocellular4.874.366.585.91cancerHepG2hepatocellular5.184.256.745.98cancerA375Skin cancer1.651.222.352.12MCF-7Breast cancer1.120.831.811.35A549Lung cancer1.991.283.022.52SK-N-SHN",
    " \u03bcl stop buffer (50 mM EDTA, pH 8) was added to terminate the reaction. 25 \u03bcl of the above reactants and 75 \u03bcl water were added into a streptavidin-conjugated 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The plate was washed with 200 \u03bcl PBS for 3 times. P-Tyr-100 antibody was diluted at a ratio of 1:1000, added to the 96-well plate, and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The plate was washed with 200 \u03bcl PBS for 3 times. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody was diluted and added in an amount of 100 \u03bcl to the 96-well plate, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then the plate was washed with 200 \u03bcl PBS/T for 3 times. 100 \u03bcl TMB substrate was added, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then 100 \u03bcl stop solution was added, and mixed evenly. Absorbance was read at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer. IC<sub>50 </sub>(a concentration of the compound at which the inhibition rate of kinase activity reaches 50%) was calculated with software SPSS.</p>2) Activity of the rest 14 receptor tyrosine kinases was tested by using Kinase Glo Plus assay format, Progmag, and IC<sub>50 </sub>with regard to kinase activity was calculated based on the inhibition rate.</p>Results were shown in Table 5. IC<sub>50 </sub>with regard to inhibition of 2-indolone derivatives (Indo 5) of the present disclosure on c-Met kinase was 0.16 \u03bcM, IC<sub>50 </sub>for TrkA kinase was 0.022 \u03bcM, and IC<sub>50 </sub>for TrkB kinase was 0.23 \u03bcM, whereas IC50 for inhibition on other kinases were over 10 \u03bcM. These results suggested that 2-indolone derivatives (Indo 5) of the present disclosure significantly inhibited the activity of c-Met and Trk (including TrkA and TrkB) kinases, and exhibited a good selectivity. The results indicated that 2-indolone derivatives (Indo 5) of the present disclosure may specifically inhibit the activity of c-Met and Trk kinases, while have no significant effect on other kinases.</p>TABLE 5Specific inhibition of 2-indolone derivatives (Indo 5) of thepresent disclosure on activities of c-Met and Trk kinasesKinaseIC50 (\u03bcM)TrkA0.022TrkB0.23c-Met0.16PDGFR&gt;10FGFR&gt;10AXL&gt;10FLT1&gt;10EPHA1&gt;10IGF1R&gt;10EGFR&gt;10InsR&gt;10c-KIT&gt;10Ephb1&gt;10RET&gt;10EGFR (T790, L858R)&gt;10</p>Experimental Example 7Inhibition of 2-Indolone Derivatives (Indo 5) on c-Met Phosphorylation and Signaling Pathway in Hepatoma CellsAs previously reported, c-Met signaling pathway mediated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in formation and development of tumors. c-Met kinase is a high affinity receptor for HGF, and has essential function in tissue repair, wound healing, liver regeneration and embryonic development. Studies have shown that abnormal expression of c-Met may directly lead to tumorigenesis. By binding to HGF, c-Met activates downstream signaling pathway, disrupts adhesion between tumor cells, promotes cell movement, and thereby enhances invasion ability and angiogenesis of tumor ce"
