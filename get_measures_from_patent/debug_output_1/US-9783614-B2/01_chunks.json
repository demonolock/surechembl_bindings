    "ocess. The ultimate goal of the pathway is to produce Thrombin, which can then convert soluble Fibrinogen into Fibrin that forms a clot. The process of generation of Thrombin can be divided into three phases: the Intrinsic and Extrinsic pathways which provide alternative routes for the generation of an active clotting factor: FXa (Activated Factor-X), and the final Common pathway which results in Thrombin formation [Hoffman M. M. and Monroe D. M. (2005) Rethinking the coagulation cascade. Curr Hematol Rep. 4:391-396; Johne J, Blume C, Benz P M, Pozgajova M, Ullrich M, Schuh K, Nieswandt B, Walter U, Renn\u00e9 T. (2006) Platelets promote coagulation factor XII-mediated proteolytic cascade systems in plasma. Biol Chem. 387:173-178].</p>Platelet aggregation: When a break in a blood vessel occurs, substances are exposed that normally are not in direct contact with the blood flow. These substances (primarily Collagen and von Willebrand factor) allow the platelets to adhere to the broken surface. Once a platelet adheres to the surface, it releases chemicals that attract additional platelets to the damaged area, referred to as platelet aggregation. These two processes are the first responses to stop bleeding.</p>Coagulation Factor XI and Coagulation Factor XIa</p>The coagulation Factor XI (FXI) is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as a disulfide bond-linked dimer complexed with High Molecular Weight Kininogen. Each polypeptide chain of this dimer is approximately 80 kD. The zymogen Factor XI is converted into its active form, the coagulation factor XIa (FXIa) either via the contact phase of blood coagulation or through Thrombin-mediated activation on the platelet surface. During this activation of factor XI, an internal peptide bond is cleaved in each of the two chains, resulting in the activated factor XIa, a serine protease composed of two heavy and two light chains held together by disulfide bonds. This serine protease FXIa converts the coagulation Factor IX into IXa, which subsequently activates coagulation Factor X (Xa). Xa then can mediate coagulation Factor II/Thrombin activation. Defects in this factor lead to Rosenthal syndrome (also known as hemophilia C), a blood coagulation abnormality characterized by prolonged bleeding from injuries, frequent or heavy nosebleeds, traces of blood in the urine, and heavy menstrual bleeding in females. As used herein, \u201ccoagulation factor XI,\u201d \u201cfactor XI\u201d, or \u201cFXI\u201d refers to any FXI from any mammalian species that expresses the protein. For example, FXI can be human, non-human primate (such as baboon), mouse, dog, cat, cow, horse, pig, rabbit, and any other species exhibiting the coagulation factor XI involved in the regulation of blood flow, coagulation, and/or thrombosis.</p>The cleavage site for the activation of the coagulation factor XI by the coagulation factor XIIa is an internal peptide bond between Arg-369 and Ile-370 in each polypeptide chain [Fujikawa K, Chung D W, Hendrickson L E, D",
    " mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the antibody of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-glycosylated. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals [see Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, USA); Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Sedman, J. G., Smith, J.

Therefore an object of the present invention are also host cells comprising the vector or a nucleic acid molecule, whereby the host cell can be a higher eukaryotic host cell, such as a mammalian cell, a lower eukaryotic host cell, such as a yeast cell, and may be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell.</p>Another object of the present invention is a method of using the host cell to produce an antibody and antigen binding fragments, comprising culturing the host cell under suitable conditions and recovering said antibody.</p>Therefore another object of the present invention is the antibody 005-004 produced with the host cells of the present invention and purified to at least 95% homogeneity by weight.</p>Affinity</p>\u201cAffinity\u201d or \u201cbinding affinity\u201d K<sub>D </sub>are often determined by measurement of the equilibrium association constant (ka) and equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and calculating the quotient of kd to ka (K<sub>D</sub>=kd/ka). The term \u201cimmunospecific\u201d or \u201cspecifically binding\u201d means that the antibody binds to the coagulation factor XI and/or its activated form, the coagulation factor XIa with an affinity K<sub>D </sub>of lower than or equal to 10<sup>\u22126</sup>M (monovalent affinity). The term \u201chigh affinity\u201d means that the <sub>KD </sub>that the antibody binds to the coagulation factor XI and/or its activated form, the coagulation factor XIa with an affinity K<sub>D </sub>of lower than or equal to 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M (monovalent affinity). The antibody may have substantially greater affinity for the target antigen compared to other unrelated molecules. The antibody may also have substantially greater affinity for the target antigen compared to homologs, e.g. at least 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold 10-fold, 100-fold, 10<sup>\u22123</sup>-fold, 10<sup>\u22124</sup>-fold, 10<sup>\u22125</sup>-fold, 10<sup>\u22126</sup>-fold or greater relative affinity for the target antigen. Such affinities may be readily determined using conventional techniques, such as by equilibrium dialysis; by using the BIAcore 2000 instrument, using general procedures outlined by the manufacturer; by radioimmunoassay using radiolabeled target antigen; or by another method known to the skilled artisan. The affinity data may be analyzed, for example, by the method described in [Kaufman R J, Sharp P A.

Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Two antibodies are said to \u2018bind the same epitope\u2019 if one antibody is shown to compete with the second antibody in a competitive binding assay, by any of the methods well known to those of skill in the art, and if preferably all amino acids of the epitope are bound by the two antibodies.</p>The term \u2018maturated antibodies\u2019 or \u2018maturated antigen-binding fragments\u2019 such as maturated Fab variants includes derivatives of an antibody or antibody fragment exhibiting stronger and/or improved binding\u2014i. e. binding with increased affinity\u2014to a given antigen such as FXI. Maturation is the process of identifying a small number of mutations within the six CDRs of an antibody or antibody fragment leading to this affinity increase. The maturation process is the combination of molecular biology methods for introduction of mutations into the antibody and screening for identifying the improved binders.</p>Pharmaceutical Composition and Administration</p>The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which may comprise FXI/FXIa antibodies, alone or in combination with at least one other agent, such as stabilizing compound, which may be administered in any sterile, biocompatible pharmaceutical carrier, including, but not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, and water.

The determination of an effective dose is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.</p>A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of protein or its antibodies, antagonists, or inhibitors that ameliorate the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, ED<sub>50</sub>/LD<sub>50</sub>. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations what include the E"
