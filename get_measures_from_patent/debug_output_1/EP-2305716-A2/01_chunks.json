Suitable detectable labels include, for example, fluorophores, chromophores, radioactive atoms, electron-dense reagents, enzymes, and ligands having specific binding partners. Enzymes are typically detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase can be detected by its ability to convert tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer.

A 1:25 dilution of cell supernatant was passed over a protein A surface for 5 min followed by washing the surface for 10 mins. Subsequently, GPNMB was injected for 90 sec. over the surface at a concentration of 880 nM followed by dissociation. Double-referenced binding data were obtained by subtracting the signal from a control flow cell and subtracting the baseline drift of a buffer injected just prior to the antigen injection. GPNMB binding ddata for each mAb was normalized for the amount of mAb captured on each surface. Normalized, drift corrected responses were also measured. The sensorgrams were fit to a simple 1:1 kinetic model. The results are shown in Table 7. Sixteen of the cell supernatants contained mAb that significantly bound to GPNMB and three Mabs, 15.1, 15.2, and 15.3 showed strong binding to GPNMB.\nTable 7SampleKd (nM)ka (M-1s-1 )kd (s-1 )Expression Level15.152165248.55 E-04medium15.359134177.97E-04medium15.261126357.70E-04high2.29692578.90E-04medium10.211839554.66E-04low7.312196481.17E-03medium7.1122118421.44 E-03medium7.214193561.32E-03high10.314736265.32E-04low10.120942358.85E-04low8.224275551.83E-03medium8.326465511.73E-03low8.132968302.25E-03medium12.340715496.31 E-04medium12.243512805.57E-04medium12.163015871.00E-03low1.11000&lt;1500ndhigh1.2&gt;1000&lt;1500ndhigh1.3&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium2.1&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium5.1&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium5.2&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium5.3&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium9.1&gt;1000&lt;1500ndmedium9.2&gt;1000&lt;1500ndlow9.31000&lt;1500ndlow11.1&gt;1000&lt;1500ndlow11.2&gt;1000&lt;1500ndlow11.3&gt;1000&lt;1500ndlow</p>Example 4: Binning of AntibodiesCertain antibodies, described herein were binned in accordance with the protocol described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.20030157730</patcit>.

Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBST for 3 hrs and probed with rabbit anti-GPNMB polyclonal antibody (1:1000) for 3 hrs.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. Unconjugated CRO11, free MMAE, CRO11-vcMMAE or isotype-matched vcMMAE conjugated antibody at various concentrations was added to sub-confluent cell cultures and incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C: The cells were then transferred into 6-well plates and allowed to form colonies. Colonies were stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and counted. The surviving cell fractions were calculated based upon the ratio of the treated sample and the untreated control. The results were expressed as a percentage of control using GraphPad Prism Version 4 software. The IC50 was defined as the concentration resulting in a 50% reduction of colony formation compared to untreated control cultures.</p>Results:To demonstrated that CR011-vcMMAE growth-inhibitory activity is dependent on GPNMB expression, full-length GPNMB protein was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells. Immnunoblot (Figure 9A) and FACS (Figure 9B) analyses confirmed that GPNMB was expressed in GPNMB/plasmid transfected cells. Treatment of cells with CR011-vcMMAE, followed by clonogenic assay, demonstrated that GPNMB-expressing HEK293 cells were more sensitive to CRO11-vcMMAE-mediated growth-inhibition than were control cells devoid of GPNMB expression (Figure 9C).</p>To further verify our findings, GPNMB-expressing SK-Mel-2 cells were transfected with siRNA to specifically inhibit endogenous GPNMB expression. Immunoblot and FACS analyses performed 2 and 4 days after transfection demonstrated that total GPNMB (Figure 10A) and surface GPNMB (Figure 10B) protein levels were significantly reduced in SK-Mel-2 cells after the transfection when compared to the control transfectants. The amount of GPNMB expression was reduced for at least 7 days after transfection. Treatment of these cells with CR011-vcMMAE demonstrated that SK-Mel-2 cells were less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory activity of CR011-vcMMAE following siRNA-mediated GPNMB knockdown (Figure 10C). Taken together, these data indicate that the growth-inhibitory activity of CRO11-vcMMAE required cell surface GPNMB expression",

CG56972 transcript expression in human astrocytoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and tumors of neuroectodermal origin.We examined the expression of CGS6972 transcripts in human cancer cell lines and tissues (Figures 13 A &amp; B). Our transcript expression analysis indicated that CG56972 was strongly expressed in all (15/15) human brain cancer cell lines tested (Figure 13A) Using RTQ-PCR, CG56972 was found to be expressed in cells of mixed glioblastoma/astrocytoma orgin, glioblastoma/gliomas, astrocytomas and metastatic neuroblastomas. The majority of brain or CNS tumor cell lines showed high level expression with CTs&lt;27. Of note, CG56972 was found to be highly expressed (CT&lt;27.0) in XF-498, U-118-MG, SNB-78, and SF-539 cells. As shown in Figure 13B, CG56972 was also expressed at high levels in 4/5 glioma human biopsies and 1/4 medulloblastoma human biopsies. Using microarray analysis from an in house chip containing a large panel of human genes (Figure 13C), CG56972 was found to be highly expressed in 5/9 brain cancers of astrocytoma or glioblastoma origin as well as 4/9 oligodendrogliomas. Our analysis of these tumor expression profiles showed that CG56972 message was detected to a much lesser degree in normal brain tissues. These data are also consistent with our immunohistochemical data that demonstrated the lack of CRO11 staining in normal human brain including neurons and glial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CG56972 transcript is expressed at highly elevated quantities in brain cancer and oligodendroglioma cell lines and specimens isolated from human tumors.</p>2. Generation of fully human CRO11 monoclonal antibodies to CG56972/GPNMBThe CG56972 protein is predicted to be a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. The highly elevated expression of CG56972 transcripts and the potential cell surface localization of this protein in human cancer samples encouraged us to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a potential cancer therapeutic. Therefore, we cloned the human CG56972 extracellular domain (ECD; aa 23-480). Sequencing of the cloned cDNA revealed the presence of an in-frame 36-nt insertion, likely due to alternative splicing at the exon 6/7 boundary, which added an additional 12-aa (ATTLKSYDSNTP) (SEQ ID NO: 343) after residue 339 of the published GPNMB protein sequence. We verified the authenticity of 36-nt insertion via RT-PCR. The cDNA was next expressed in human HEK293 cells. The resultant protein was harvested, purified from the conditioned media and used as an immunogen to generate fully human mAbs against CG56972-ECD. Following immunization of XeiioMotisc\u00ae, mAbs that specifically recognized the CG56972-ECD protein via ELISA were generated. Our lead mAb, designated 1.15 or CRO11 against purified CG56972-ECD, exhibiting a Kd of 52 nM against purified CG56972-ECD protein, was selected for in depth characterization and will be the focus of the remainder of this example.</p>3. CRO11 mAb 1.15 detection of CG56972 protein expression in human brain cancersWe further used CRO11 monoclonal antibodies to examine the surface expression of CG56972 protein on a variety of brain cancer cell lines by flow cytometry (Figure 14 &amp; Table 54). FACS analysis demonstrated that the brain cancer cell lines XF-498, U-118-MG, SNB-78 and SF-539; all positive for CG56972 transcript expression exhibited surface staining with CR011 monoclonal antibodies of at least 1.5-fold above isotype control mAb background (Figure 14). The cell line SF-268, that was the most weakly positive 32) for the CG56972 transcript expression (Figure 13C &amp; Table 54) showed minimal surface staining as expected of around 1.5-fold above control mAb background. Our SK-MEL-2 melanoma cell line that is our positive control for CG56972 expression showed strong cell surface staining.</p>To investigate CG56972 protein expression in our panel of brain cancer cell lines, total cell lysates were harvest, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane filters and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a CG56972 polyclonal antibody. As shown in Figure 15, the CG56972 polyclonal antibody detected two protein species that are differential glycosylation products of CG56972 of approximately 100 and 120 kDa from various brain cancer cell lines that have been"
