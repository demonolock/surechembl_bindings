{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nNonspecific binding is determined using 1 uM 5-HT creatinine sulfate.\nThe IC50 value (the concentration which inhibits 50% of the specific binding) is determined by linear regression of the concentration-response data (log concentration vs. logit percent values).\nKi values are calculated according to Cheng & Prusoff: Ki = IC50/(1 + (L/Kd)), where L is the concentration of the radioligand used in the experiment and the Kd value is the dissociation constant for the radioligand determined in separate saturation experiments.\nIC50 values are converted to apparent Ki values by the following equation: IC50/ (1 + ([agonist]/EC50 of agonist)).\nEach tube receives: 50 uL <sup>3</sup>H-5-CT** (0.4 nM final concentration) \nEach tube receives: 20uL tissue, 20uL drug or buffer (at 5X final concentration), 20 uL 100 nM agonist or buffer (at 5X final concentration)"}
