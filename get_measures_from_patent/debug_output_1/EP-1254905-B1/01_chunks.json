Cells are harvested by removing the media, rinsing the flasks out with\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then allowed to sit for 2-3 minutes with PBS containing\n2.5 mM EDTA. Cells are dislodged and poured into a RcappableS centrifuge tube. Flasks are\nrinsed with PBS and added to centrifuge tube. The cells are centrifuged for ten minutes at\n40,000 x g (20,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor). The supernatant is discarded and at this point\nthe remaining pellet is weighed and can be stored frozen (-20 degrees C) until used in the\nbinding assay. Pellets (fresh or frozen) are homogenized in 50 mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 7.4 at 4\ndegrees C) using a Polytron homogenizer (setting 15,000 rpm) for ten seconds in a biologcial\nhood certified for use with human tissues. The homogenate is centrifuged for ten minutes at\n40,000 x g. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet resuspended with the Polytron in a\nfresh ice-cold 50 mM Tris HCI (pH 7.4 at 4 degrees) buffer and centrifuged again. The final\npellet is resuspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 7.7 at 25 degrees)\ncontaining 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for a final tissue concentration of 5-15\nmg wet weight of original pellet per mL buffer (2X final concentration).</p>\n  \n    Receptor Binding\n  \n  Incubation is initiated by the addition of tissue to V-bottom polypropylene plates (in\ntriplicate). Incubation is at 25 degrees C for 2 hours.</p>\n  Each tube receives:\n100 uL tissue suspension (5-15mg/mL original wet weight), 50 uL <sup>3</sup>H-5-CT** (0.4 nM\nfinal concentration), and 50 uL drug or buffer**<sup>3</sup>H-5-CT is made up in assay buffer that contains 40 uM pargyline &amp; 0.4% ascorbic\nacid (for final concentrations of 10 uM pargyline &amp; 0.1% ascorbic acid).</p>\n  Nonspecific binding is determined using 1 uM 5-HT creatinine sulfate. Incubation is\nended by rapid filtration under vacuum through fire-treated Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters \n(presoaked in 0.3% PEI for two hours and dried) using a 96 well Skatron Harvester (3 sec\nprewet; 20 seconds wash; 15 seconds dry). Filters are put into LKB sample bags with 10 mL\nBetaScint. Radioactivity is quantified by liquid scintillation counting using a BetaPlate counter\n(LKB).</p>\n  The percent inhibition of specific binding is calculated for each concentration of test\ncompound. An IC50 value (the concentration which inhibits 50% of the specific binding) is\ndetermined by linear regression of the concentration-response data (log concentration vs. logit\npercent values). Ki values are calculated according to Cheng &amp; Prusoff: Ki = IC50/(1 +\n(L/Kd)), where L is the concentration of the radioligand used in the experiment and the Kd\nvalue is the dissociation constant for the radioligand determined in separate saturation\nexperiments.</p>\n  The following assay can be used to evaluate the functional activity of compounds\nat 5HT7 receptors.</p>\n  \n    5-HT7 RECEPTOR MEDIATED ADENYLATE CYCLASE ACTIVITY\n  \n  \n    Materials\n  \n  \n    \n      1.5 mL siliconized polypropylene microfuge tubes (Costar 3207)\n      12 x 75 mm boroscilicate glass tubes\n      Heated water bath\n      Glass-Teflon Homogenizer\n      Centrifuge\n      HEK-293 cells expressing rat 5-HT7 receptors\n      32P-ATP (30 Ci/mmol: NEG-003 - New England Nuclear)\n      3H-cAMP (30 Ci/mmol: NET-275 - New England Nuclear)\n    \n    \n      1. Cells are grown according to standard cell culture techniques. Cells are harvested\nby replacing the media with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mM EDTA. The cells are\nhomogenized using a hand-held glass-teflon homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged at\n35,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. The pellet is resuspended in 100 mM HEPES\nbuffer containing 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) to a final protein concentration of 40 microgram protein\nper tube.\n      2. The Reaction Mix is prepared so that the following agents will be at these final\nconcentrations in tube: 4.0mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5m MATP, 1.0m McAMP, 0.5mM IBMX, 10mM,\nphosphocreatine, 0.31 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase, and 100uM GTP0.5-1 microcuries a-[<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP\nper tube.\n      3. Incubation is initiated by the addition of tissue to siliconized microfuge tubes (in\ntriplicate). Incubation is at 37'C for 15 minutes.\nEach tube receives:\n20uL tissue, 20uL drug or buffer (at 5X final concentration), 20 uL 100 nM agonist or\nbuffer (at 5X final concentration), and 40 uL Reaction Mix \n      4. Incubation is terminated by the addition of 100 uL 2% SDS, 1.3 mM cAMP, 45 mM\nATP solution containing 40,000 dpm [<sup>3</sup>H]-cAMP to monitor the recovery of cAMP from the\ncolumns. The separation of [<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and [<sup>32</sup>P]-cAMP is accomplished using the method of\nSalomon et al., Analytical Biochemistry 58: 541-548, 1974.\nRadioactivity is quantified by liquid scintillation counting.\n    \n  </p>\n  The maximal effect of agonists is defined in terms of the maximal effect of serotonin\n(5-HT). Antagonists are evaluated by their ability to inhibit 5HT-stimulated adenylate cyclase\nactivity. IC50 values are converted to apparent Ki values by the following equation: IC50/ (1 +\n([agonist]/EC50 of agonist)).</p>\n  Activity of the active compounds as antidepressants and related pharmacological\nproperties can be determined by methods (1)-(4) below, which are described in Koe, B. et al.,\nJournal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 226 (3), 686-700 (1983).\nSpecifically, activity can be determined by\nstudying (1) their ability to affect the efforts of mice to escape from a swim-tank (Porsolt\nmouse \"behavior despair\" test), (2) their ability to potentiate 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced\nbehavioral symptoms in mice in vivo, (3) their ability to antagonize the serotonin-depleting\nactivity of p-chloroamphetamine hydrochloride in rat brain in vivo, and (4) their ability to block\nthe uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine by synaptosomal rat brain cells in vitro.\nThe ability of the active compounds to counteract reserpine hypothermia in mice in vivo can\nbe determined according to the methods described in U.S. Pat.
