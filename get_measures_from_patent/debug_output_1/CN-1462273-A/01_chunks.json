    "es expressing recombinant LH are well known in the art (Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of the receptor is achieved by expression of DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site-directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR and construction of suitable expression systems are heretofore well known in the art. A portion or all of the DNA encoding the desired protein may be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably including restriction sites to facilitate ligation reactions. The DNA coding sequence may be provided with control elements appropriate for the transcription and translation of the included coding sequence. It is well known that expression systems are now compatible with a variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts, such as bacteria, and eukaryotic hosts, such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells, and thelike.</p>Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound and observed for stimulation or inhibition of the binding or functional response.</p>Alternatively, isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor can be used to measure binding of the compound.</p>For the measurement of binding, a radioactively or fluorescently labeled compound may be used. As a reference compound, human recombinant LH may be used. In the alternative, a competitive binding assay may also be performed.</p>Another assay involves screening LH receptor agonist compounds by measuring receptor-mediated stimulation of cAMP accumulation. Thus, one such method involves the expression of a receptor on the surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to a test compound. The amount of cAMP was then measured. The level of cAMP will decrease or increase depending on the inhibitory or stimulatory effect of the test compound on receptor binding.</p>In addition to direct measurement of, for example, cAMP levels in exposed cells, cell lines transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene whose expression is responsive to cAMP levels, in addition to transfection with a receptor encoding DNA, may also be used. Such reporter genes may be cAMP inducible or may be constructed in such a way that they are linked to new cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression may be controlled by any response element whose response alters levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are, for example, LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in stratawa, Ch, Himmler, a and czernilofsky, a.p. (1995) curr. 574.</p>For the selection of active compounds, at 10<sup>-5</sup>The test at M must result in an activity which is 20% higher than the maximum activity when LH is used as reference. Another criterion may be EC<sub>5"
