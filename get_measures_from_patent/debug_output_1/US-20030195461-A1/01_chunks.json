    "rnative splicing. The standard isoform of CD44 (CD44s), which is ubiquitously expressed, does not contain sequences encoded by these variant exons. Numerous variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) which contain different combinations of exons (v1-y10) inserted into the extracellular domain are restricted in their expression to proliferating epithelial cells, activated lymphocytes and malignant cells. </p>[0069] Recent studies have demonstrated that the CD44 protein is the primary receptor for hyaluronate in humans. Since CD44 is the principle transmembrane receptor for this extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan, CD44 has also been termed the hyaluronate receptor. It can also bind some other extracellular matrix ligands (chondroitin sulphate, heparin sulphate, and fibronectin) with lower affinity. </p>[0070] This CD44 receptor-ligand interaction is required for many normal cellular processes including cellular adhesion (aggregation and migration), hyaluronate degradation, lymphocyte activation, lymphocyte homing into inflammatory sites, and release of cytokines. Additional specialized functions include assembly of a pericellular matrix during chondrogenesis and wound healing. Interactions between CD44 receptor and hyaluronic acid (HA) deliver important signals to normal and transformed CD44 bearing cells. In common with many other cell surface receptors, cells that express CD44 regulate expression of this receptor in response to ligand binding. </p>[0071] The CD44 molecule is an 85 kD glycosylated molecule with N-terminal sequence homology to cartilage link proteins. Isoforms of CD44 of varying sizes have been described on many cell types. Variations in the size of CD44 isoforms occur due to glycosylation differences and to the addition of chondroitin sulfate molecules to CD44. The 85 kD form has been identified in serum, plasma and synovial fluid. Alternative splicing creates a hematopoietic form of the molecule, CD44H, and additional subtypes. Alternative splicing results in changes in protein glycosylation and provides a mechanism for the regulation of binding activity of CD44. Thus, the CD44 molecule, by existing in several isoforms and due to its wide cellular distribution and functional association with other adhesion molecules, is a multifunctional proinflammatory molecule involved in immune cell activation as well as metastasis of certain tumor cell types. </p>[0072] The predominant isoform found on human leukocytes is CD44H. Both hyaluronate and CD44 mAb binding to monocytes induces IL-1 release. On T cells, hyaluronate and CD44 mAb ligation of CD44 have disparate effects; CD44 mAbs augment T cell triggering while hyaluronate suppresses T cell triggering. Finally, CD44 mAbs and polyclonal anti-CD44 serum have been shown to inhibit the binding of lymphocytes to endothelial venules in inflammatory sites such as synovium. </p>[0073] The physiological functions of CD44 indicate that it plays a role in the metastatic spread of tumors. CD44 properties, such as hyaluronate-mediated adhesion, cellular motility, and adhesion to lymphoid tissue, are among several that are required by invasive and metastatic tumor cells. In vivo experiments indicate that tumor cells transfected to overexpress specific CD44 isoforms display enhanced metastatic potential. Of t",

Such agents are useful in preventing restenosis of arteries treated by angioplasty, rotational atherectomy or other cardiovascular or general vascular therapeutic procedure. </p>[0119] In each of the surgical solutions of the present invention, the agents are included in low concentrations and are delivered locally in low doses relative to concentrations and doses required with conventional methods of drug administration to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. It is impossible to obtain an equivalent therapeutic effect by delivering similarly dosed agents via other (i.e., intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or oral) routes of drug administration since drugs given systemically are subject to first- and second-pass metabolism. The concentration of each agent is determined in part based on its dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>. As used herein, the term dissociation constant is intended to encompass both the equilibrium dissociation constant for its respective agonist-receptor or antagonist-receptor interaction and the equilibrium inhibitory constant for its respective activator-enzyme or inhibitor-enzyme interaction. Each agent is preferably included at a low concentration of 0.1 to 10,000 times K<sub>d </sub>nanomolar, except for cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which may be required at larger concentrations depending on the particular inhibitor selected. Preferably, each agent is included at a concentration of 1.0 to 1,000 times K<sub>d </sub>nanomolar and most preferably at approximately 100 times K<sub>d </sub>nanomolar. These concentrations are adjusted as needed to account for dilution in the absence of metabolic transformation at the local delivery site. The exact agents selected for use in the solution, and the concentration of the agents, varies in accordance with the particular application, as described below. </p>[0120] A solution in accordance with the present invention can include just a single or multiple inhibitor(s) of tumor cell adhesion, invasion and/or metastasis, pain/inflammation inhibitory agent(s), a single or multiple anti-spasm agent(s), a combination of inhibitors of tumor cell adhesion, invasion and/or metastasis, anti-spasm and pain/inflammation inhibitory agents, or anti-restenosis agents from the enumerated classes, at low concentration. However, due to the aforementioned synergistic effect of multiple agents, and the desire to broadly block pain and inflammation, sp",
