    "ny polymeric moiety. </p>[0030] Amelioration: As used herein, the term \"amelioration\" refers to the prevention, reduction or palliation of a state, or improvement of the state of a subject. Amelioration includes, but does not require complete recovery or complete prevention of a disease, disorder and/or condition {e.g. , a mast cell activity-associated disorder). </p>[0031] Antagonist: As used herein, the term \"antagonist\" refers to an agent condition, or event whose presence, level, degree, type, or form correlates with decreased level or activity of another agent (i.e., the inhibited agent, or target). In general, an antagonist may be or include an agent of any chemical class including, for example, small molecules, polypeptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, metals, and/or any other entity that shows the relevant inhibitory activity. In some embodiments, an antagonist may be direct (in which case it exerts its influence directly upon its target); in some embodiments, an antagonist may be indirect (in which case it exerts its influence by other than binding to its target; e.g. , by interacting with a regulator of the target, so that level or activity of the target is altered). </p>[0032] Antibody: As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to a polypeptide that includes canonical immunoglobulin sequence elements sufficient to confer specific binding to a particular target antigen. As is known in the art, intact antibodies as produced in nature are approximately 150 kD tetrameric agents comprised of two identical heavy chain polypeptides (about 50 kD each) and two identical light chain polypeptides (about 25 kD each) that associate \n\n with each other into what is commonly referred to as a \"Y-shaped\" structure. Each heavy chain is comprised of at least four domains (each about 110 amino acids long)- an amino-terminal variable (VH) domain (located at the tips of the Y structure), followed by three constant domains: CHI, CH2, and the carboxy-terminal CH3 (located at the base of the Y's stem). A short region, known as the \"switch\", connects the heavy chain variable and constant regions. The \"hinge\" connects CH2 and CH3 domains to the rest of the antibody. Two disulfide bonds in this hinge region connect the two heavy chain polypeptides to one another in an intact antibody. Each light chain is comprised of two domains - an amino-terminal variable (VL) domain, followed by a carboxy-terminal constant (CL) domain, separated from one another by another \"switch\". Intact antibody tetramers are comprised of two heavy chain-light chain dimers in which the heavy and light chains are linked to one another by a single disulfide bond; two other disulfide bonds connect the heavy chain hinge regions to one another, so that the dimers are connected to one another and the tetramer is formed. Naturally-produced antibodies are also glycosylated, typically on the CH2 domain. Each domain in a natural antibody has a structure characterized by an \"immunoglobulin fold\" formed from two beta sheets (e.g. , 3-, 4-, or 5- stranded sheets) packed against each other in a compressed antiparallel beta barrel.
