    "me cutting GlcNAc-phosphate bond obtains Man-6-P terminal oligosaccharide (Canfield etc., U.S. Patent number 6,537,785).The object of Man-6-P is that lysosomal enzyme is turned to intracellular lysosomal pathway from Secretory Pathway.MPR in trans-Golgi combines the enzyme carrying Man-6-P, thus this enzyme is oriented to lysosome but not cell surface.</p>Except there is Man-6-P mark on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides except, the lysosome orientation of enzyme depends on the acidifying of the transport inclusion body appearing at trans-Golgi storehouse (transGolgistack) end.The vesica inclusion comprising lysosomal enzyme is caused to flow into born of the same parents' external environment (Braulke etc., Eur.J.CellBiol.43 (3): 316-321,1987) with the sour environment in diffusible these inclusion bodies of alkali molecules chemical quencs.Acidifying needs the specific cavity ATP enzyme (Nishi etc., Nat.Rev.Mol.CellBiol.3 (2): 94-103,2002) be embedded in inclusion body film.Estimate that this ATP enzyme inefficacy can strengthen the secretion of lysosomal enzyme and damage lysosome orientation.Prepare defective clone in cavity ATP enzyme and estimate that the recombinase of phosphorylation is unproductive is diverted to lysosomal compartment in born of the same parents by preventing.</p>In 1984, produce and characterize inclusion body acidifying special defective Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant (Park etc., Somat.CellMol.Genet.17 (2): 137-150,1991).Chemomorphosis CHO-KI cell, and exist at toxin and select survival condition under raised temperature.The lethality that these toxin will show them completely needs inclusion body acidifying (Marnell etc., J.Cell.Biol.99 (6): 1907-1916,1984).In last research, select the mixture with two kinds of toxin of different mechanism of action to avoid selecting toxin specific tolerance.Its principle is when causing little to the possibility of the fortuitous mutation that a kind of particular toxin tolerates, two of two kinds of complete different toxin specific while fortuitous mutation possibility do not exist.At high temperature carry out selecting so that temperature-sensitive mutation.This genetic screening obtains two kinds of mutant, and G.7.1 one is appointed as (G71), and it at high temperature tolerates toxin.Infringement in G71 is not because intake of caused by two kinds of toxin or its mechanism of action, but under high temperature, this clone can not caused by acidifying inclusion body.At the temperature allowed, (34 DEG C) also observe this incompetence, but degree is lower.Also find that G71 cell is auxotrophic to iron under high temperature, although can from substratum normal ingestion Transferrins,iron complexes (Timchak etc., J.Biol.Chem.261 (30): 14154-14159,1986).Due to Transferrins,iron complexes only Iron Release at a low ph, although there is normal Transferrins,iron complexes to absorb, inclusion body acidifying fault is shown to the auxotroph of iron.Another research proves t",
