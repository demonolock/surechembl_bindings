    "e, N.Y.). In all cases, positive staining represented fluorescence signal above control staining where the entire procedure outlined above was followed with the exception of application of a primary antibody solution. Representative images were captured using a digital color videocamera and ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, Ca.). For triple-stained samples, each image was taken using only one emission filter at a time. Layered montages were then prepared using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, Ca.). \n\n Table 11-1.

A minimum of 1000 cells were counted per condition or if less, the total number of cells observed in that condition. The percentage of cells positive for a given stain was assessed by dividing the number of positive cells by the total number of cells as determined by DAPI (nuclear) staining.</p>[0253] To identify unique, secreted factors as a result of co-culture, conditioned media samples taken prior to culture fixation were frozen down at -80<sup>0</sup>C overnight. Samples were then applied to ultrafiltration spin devices (MW cutoff 30 kD). Retentate was applied to immunoaffinity chromatography columns (anti-Hu-albumin; IgY) (immunoaffinity did not remove albumin from the samples). Filtrate was analyzed by MALDI. The pass through was applied to Cibachron Blue affinity chromatography columns. Samples were analyzed by SDS- PAGE and 2D gel electrophoresis.</p>[0254] Following culture with umbilicus-derived cells, co-cultured neural progenitor cells derived from adult rat hippocampus exhibited significant differentiation along all three major lineages in the central nervous system. This effect was clearly observed after five days in co-culture, with numerous cells elaborating complex processes and losing their phase bright features characteristic of dividing progenitor cells. Conversely, neural progenitors grown alone in the absence of bFGF and EGF appeared unhealthy and survival was limited.</p>[0255] After completion of the procedure, cultures were stained for markers indicative of undifferentiated stem and progenitor cells (nestin), immature and mature neurons (TuJl), astrocytes (GFAP), and mature oligodendrocytes (MBP). Differentiation along all three \n\n lineages was confirmed while control conditions did not exhibit significant differentiation as evidenced by retention of nestin-positive staining amongst the majority of cells.</p>[0256] The percentage of differentiated neural progenitors following co-culture with umbilicus-derived cells was quantified. Umbilicus-derived cells significantly enhanced the num"
