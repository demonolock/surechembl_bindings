    "e (IP<sub>3</sub>).</p>GHEK stably expressing the human mGluR5d are seeded onto 24 well poly-L-lysine coated plates at 4O x 10<sup>4</sup> cells /well in media containing 1 \u03bcCi/well [3H] myo-inositol. Cells were incubated overnight (16 h), then washed three times and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in HEPES buffered saline (146 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% \n\n glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase and 2 mM pyruvate. Cells are washed once in HEPES buffered saline and pre-incubated for 10 min in HEPES buffered saline containing 10 mM LiCl. Compounds are incubated in duplicate at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, then either glutamate (80 \u03bcM) or DHPG (30 \u03bcM) is added and incubated for an additional 30 min. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml perchloric acid (5%) on ice, with incubation at 4\u00b0C for at least 30 min. Samples are collected in 15 ml polyproplylene tubes and inositol phosphates are separated using ion-exchange resin (Dowex AG1-X8 formate form, 200-400 mesh, BIORAD) columns. Inositol phosphate separation was done by first eluting glycero phosphatidyl inositol with 8 ml 30 mM ammonium formate. Next, total inositol phosphates is eluted with 8 ml 700 mM ammonium formate / 100 mM formic acid and collected in scintillation vials. This eluate is then mixed with 8 ml of scintillant and [3H] inositol incorporation is determined by scintillation counting. The dpm counts from the duplicate samples are plotted and IC50 determinations are generated using a linear least squares fitting program.</p>Abbreviations</p>BSA Bovine Serum Albumin</p>CCD Charge Coupled Device CRC Concentration Response Curve</p>DHPG 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine</p>DPM Disintegrations per Minute</p>EDTA Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid</p>FLIPR Fluorometric Imaging Plate reader GHEK GLAST-containing Human Embrionic Kidney</p>GLAST glutamate/aspartate transporter</p>HEPES 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (buffer)</p>IP3 inositol triphosphate \n\n Generally, the compounds were active in the assay above with IC50 values less than 10 000 nM. In one aspect of the invention, the IC50 value is less than 1 \u03bcM. In a further aspect of the invention, the IC<sub>50</sub> value is less than 100 nM.</p></p>Screening for compounds active against TLESR</p>Adult Labrador retrievers of both genders, trained to stand in a Pavlov sling, are used. Mucosa-to-skin esophagostomies are formed and the dogs are allowed to recover completely before any experiments are done.</p>Motility measurement</p>In brief, after fasting for approximately 17 h with free supply of water, a multilumen sleeve/sidehole assembly (Dentsleeve, Adelaide, South Australia) is introduced through the esophagostomy to measure gastric, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal pressures. The assembly is perfused with water using a low-compliance manometric perfusion pump (Dentsleeve, Adelaide, South Australia). An air-perfused tube is passed in the oral direction to measure swallows, and an antimony electrode monitored pH, 3 cm above the LES. All signals are amplified and acquired on a personal computer at 10 Hz. \n\n When a baseline measurement free from fasting gastric/LES phase III motor activity has been obtained, placebo (0.9% NaCl) or test compound is administered intravenously (Lv., 0.5 ml/kg) in a foreleg vein. Ten min after i.v. administration, a nutrient meal (10% peptone, 5% D-glucose, 5% Intralipid, pH 3.0) is infused into the stomach through the central lumen of the assembly at 100 ml/min to a final volume of 30 ml/kg. The infusion of the nutrient meal is followed by air infusion at"
