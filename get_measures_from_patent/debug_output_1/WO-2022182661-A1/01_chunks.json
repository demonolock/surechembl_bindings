    "0098] Immunohistochemistry methods are also suitable for detecting the expression levels of biomarkers. In some aspects, antibodies or antisera, including polyclonal antisera, and monoclonal antibodies specific for each marker may be used to detect expression. The antibodies can be detected by direct labeling of the antibodies themselves, for example, with radioactive labels, fluorescent labels, hapten labels such as, biotin, or an enzyme such as horse radish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Alternatively, unlabeled primary antibody is used in conjunction with a labeled secondary antibody, comprising antisera, polyclonal antisera or a monoclonal antibody specific for the primary antibody. Immunohistochemistry protocols and kits are well known in the art and are commercially available. [0099] Immunological methods for detecting and measuring complex formation as a measure of protein expression using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and antibody arrays. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between the protein and its specific antibody. These assays and their quantitation against purified, labeled standards are well known in the art. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing antibodies reactive to two non- interfering epitopes or a competitive binding assay may be employed. [0100] Numerous labels are available and commonly known in the art. Radioisotope labels include, for example, 36S, 14C, 125I, 3H, and 131I. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques known in the art. Fluorescent labels include, for example, labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody variant using the techniques known in the art. Fluorescence can be quantified using a fluorimeter. Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149, 4,318,980 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate which can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a \n\ncolor change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat."
