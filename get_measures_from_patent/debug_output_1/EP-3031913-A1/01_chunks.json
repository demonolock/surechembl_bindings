    "binding activity measurement method in the related art. Examples of the method of measuring the binding activity include a method of Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a method of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In a case of using the ELISA, in an exemplary method, a fusion protein of human TSLP receptor and human Fc (human TSLP receptor-human Fc fusion protein (being encoded by the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5)) is immobilized on an ELISA plate, and a test antibody is added thereto to be reacted. After the reaction, a secondary antibody such as an anti-IgG antibody or the like labeled with an enzyme such as Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is reacted, and washed, and then it is possible to confirm whether the test antibody binds to human TSLP receptor with activity measurement using a reagent detecting the activity (for example, in a case of HRP labeling, BM-Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate (POD) (Roche Diagnostics. Inc.)). In the case of using SPR, for example, it is possible to use Biacore (registered trademark) 2000 (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation). In an exemplary method, the test antibody is immobilized on a surface of a sensor chip and a fusion protein of human TSLP receptor and mouse Fc (human TSLP receptor-mouse Fc fusion protein (being encoded by the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6)) is added to the flow path. It is possible to confirm whether the test antibody binds to human TSLP receptor by analyzing binding rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd), and dissociation constant (KD) between the antibody and human TSLP receptor.</p>Further, the antibody or the antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention includes an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof binding to TSLP receptor derived from other animals (for example, monkey TSLP receptor) and binding activity with respect to the receptors can be measured using the same method.</p>Preferably, the anti-human TSLP receptor antibody or the antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention binds to human TSLP receptor and has neutralizing activity with respect to human TSLP receptor. The neutralizing activity with respect to human TSLP receptor means activity of inhibiting any biological activity brought from human TSLP by binding to human TSLP receptor, and can be evaluated based on one or plural biological activities of human TSLP through human TSLP receptor as an index. Examples of such neutralizing activity include an inhibitory activity on TSLP-induced TARC mRNA expression and an inhibitory activity on TSLP-induced MDC protein production using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and methods described in Examples 5 and 6 below can be used as a specific evaluation method of the activity.</p>For evaluating effects of the anti-human TSLP receptor antibody or the antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention in more detail, an in vivo test can be used. For example, as described in Example 7 below, it is possible to evaluate effects of the anti-human ",
    " and the light chain were inserted were constructed. The expression vectors encoded the full length of the heavy chain and the light chain, and the antibody was expressed by transfection in CHO-K1SV cells. The culture supernatants were purified with Protein A column or Protein G column (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation) and a purified antibody of the fully human antibody was obtained. As a result of analyzing amino acid modification of the purified fully human T7-27, deletion of lysine of the heavy chain C terminal occurred in a large part of the purified antibody.</p>(Example 4: evaluation on binding activity by SPR analysis)For measuring binding activity of the fully human T7-27 in detail, SPR analysis was performed. In the present example, an anti-human TSLP receptor antibody TSLPR-012_141 (Patent Document 4) was used as a comparative antibody.</p>In the SPR analysis, the analysis was performed using Biacore (registered trademark) 2000 (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation). Respective anti-human TSLP receptor antibodies were immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip CM5 using a Human Antibody Capture Kit and an Amine Coupling Kit (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation). The human TSLP receptor-mouse Fc fusion protein obtained in Example 1 was serially diluted with an HBS-EP solution (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation), and 100 \u00b5L of the solution was added to the flow path at a flow rate of 50 \u00b5L/min. By this measurement system, binding rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd), and dissociation constant (KD) of the human TSLP receptor-mouse Fc fusion protein and the anti-human TSLP receptor antibody were calculated using data analysis software (BIA Evaluation) (Table 1).\nTable 1: Binding activity with respect to human TSLP receptor by SPR analysis[Table 1]KD (M)Kd (1/s)Fully human T7-270.41 x 10<sup>-8</sup>1.25 x 10<sup>-4</sup>TSLPR-012 1411.26 x 10<sup>-8</sup>3.38 x 10<sup>-4</sup></p>As a result, it became clear that the fully human T7-27 had approximately 3 fold stronger binding activity compared to TSLPR-012_141.</p>(Example 5: Evaluation of TSLP-induced TARC mRNA expression inhibition using human PBMC)For evaluation of the neutralizing activity of the fully human T7-27, TSLP-induced TARC mRNA expression inhibition in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was evaluated. Since the human PBMC include dendritic cells expressing TSLP receptor, the human PBMC can be used for evaluation of the anti-human TSLP receptor antibody. As a comparative antibody, TSLPR-012_141 was used. From the result of Test Example 1 described below, since a correlation between pathology improvement of an asthma model and inhibition of blood TARC mRNA expression using the anti-TSLP receptor antibody was found, the present evaluation system is an evaluation system indicating effectiveness on pathology.</p>200,000 cells of human PBMC (AllCells, Inc.) per well in 96 well plates (Gleiner, Inc.) were seeded at 160 \u00b5L of a PRMI1640 culture medium (Life technologies, Inc.). A dilution series (7 steps of the final concentration in the range of 0.1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL) of the human TSLP mutant-Flag proteins prepared in Example 2 was prepared in the RPMI164 culture medium and 20 \u00b5L thereof were added to the culture solution, followed by incubation for",
    " prepared in Example 2 was prepared in the RPMI1640 culture medium such that the final concentration thereof became 5 ng/mL, and added to the culture solution by an amount of 10 \u00b5L thereof, followed by incubation for 24 hours in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator whose temperature was set to 37\u00b0C. Then, dilution series (5 steps of the final concentration in the range of 0.1 ng/mL to 10 \u00b5g/mL) of the respective anti-human TSLP receptor antibody was prepared at the RPMI164 culture medium and 10 \u00b5L thereof were added to the culture solution, followed by incubation for 5 days. As a control sample, a well to which the RPMI1640 culture medium was added instead of the human TSLP mutant-Flag proteins and a well to which the RPMI1640 culture medium was added instead of the antibodies were respectively prepared. Subsequently, the culture supernatants were collected and the production amount of MDC was evaluated using a Human CCL22/MDC Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;D, Inc.) with supernatants diluted by 20 fold by PBS (Life technologies, Inc.). The test was duplicated for respective antibodies, and the inhibition rate in each antibody concentration was calculated. The inhibition rate of a well to which the RPMI1640 culture medium was added instead of the human TSLP mutant-Flag proteins was set to 100% and the inhibition rate of a well to which the RPMI1640 culture medium was added instead of the antibody was set to 0%. The antibody concentration having 50% of the inhibition rate was calculated as IC 50 (Table 3) by fitting a three parameter logistic curve.\nTable 3: Evaluation of TSLP-induced MDC proteins production inhibition using human PBMC[Table 3]IC50 (ng/mL)Fully human T7-270.12TSLPR-012_1411.10</p>As a result, it became clear that the fully human T7-27 had approximately 9 fold higher inhibition activity against TSLP-induced MDC proteins production compared to the TSLPR-012_141.</p>(Example 7: Evaluation of fully human T7-27 in monkey Ascaris antigen sensitization model)Ascaris antigen specific IgE is induced by allowing a monkey to be sensitized with Ascaris antigen, and a skin reaction is caused as an allergic reaction.</p>An Ascaris antigen liquid (DNP-Ascaris (LSL, Inc.)) suspended by aluminum peroxide gel (hereinafter, referred to as Alum) (0.5 mg/mL DNP-Ascaris suspended in PBS at a concentration of 50 mg/mL Alum, hereinafter, referred to as Ascaris antigen-Alum liquid) was administered on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 to a male cynomolgus monkey in an amount of 3.6 mL/kg intraperitoneally and an amount of 0.4 mL/kg intramuscularly for sensitization.
