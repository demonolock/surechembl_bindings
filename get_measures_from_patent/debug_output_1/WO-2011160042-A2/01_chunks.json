Alternatively, the practitioner may use non-default parameters depending on his or her experimental and/or other requirements (see for example, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). </p> [0043] Pure: As used herein, a substance and/or entity is \"pure\" if it is substantially free of other components. For example, a preparation that contains more than about 90% of a particular substance and/or entity is typically considered to be a pure preparation. In some embodiments, a substance and/or entity is at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% pure. </p> [0044] Reference agent: The term \"reference agent,\" as used herein, refers to a substance (e.g., a chemical compound, small molecule, natural product, protein, peptide, nucleic acid) that has a known activity in a particular assay. A reference agent may also be referred to as a \"standard.\" A reference agent may be a positive standard, showing positive activity in a particular assay, or may be a negative standard, known to be inactive in a particular assay. A reference agent may be contemporaneous to an agent of interest or may be a historical standard. In certain embodiments, a test agent and a reference agent are evaluated under comparable assay conditions. </p> [0045] Small molecule: In general, a \"small molecule\" is understood in the art to be an organic molecule that is less than about 5 kilodaltons (Kd) in size. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 4 Kd, about 3 Kd, about 2 Kd, or about 1 Kd. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 800 daltons (D), about 600 D, about 500 D, about 400 D, about 300 D, about 200 D, or about 100 D. In some embodiments, a small \n\n molecule is less than about 2000 g/mol, less than about 1500 g/mol, less than about 1000 g/mol, less than about 800 g/mol, or less than about 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, small molecules are non-polymeric. In some embodiments, small molecules are not proteins, peptides, or amino acids. In some embodiments, small molecules are not nucleic acids or nucleotides. In some embodiments, small molecules are not saccharides or polysaccharides. </p> [0046] Source organism: A \"source organism\", as that term is used herein, is an organism that naturally contains or produces a polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other compound (e.g., a heterologous nucleic acid) that is to be introduced in accordance with the present invention into a recipient or host cell. In some embodiments, the particular source organism to be selected is not essential to the practice of the present disclosure. Relevant considerations may include, for example, how closely related the potential source and host organisms are in evolution, or how related the source organism is with other source organisms from which sequences of other relevant nucleic acids and/or polypeptides have been selected. Where a plurality of different heterologous nucleic acids are to be introduced into and/or expressed by a host cell, different sequences ma",
    "ovided and brought directly and/or indirectly into contact with a test agent. Then, modulation of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by the test agent is detected and/or measured. Thereafter, suitable agents may be isolated and/or analyzed. For the screening of libraries, the use of high-throughput assays, which are known to the skilled person, are commercially available, and are described herein. </p> [00148] In some embodiments, in vitro assays comprise binding assays. Binding of a candidate substance to a biological target (e.g. PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex) may, in and of itself, be inhibitory, due to steric, allosteric, and/or charge-charge interactions. The biological target may be free in solution, fixed to a support, and/or expressed in and/or on the surface of a cell. The biological target and/or the test agent may be labeled, thereby permitting detection of binding. The biological target is frequently the labeled species, decreasing the chance that the labeling will interfere with and/or enhance binding. Competitive binding formats may be performed in which one of the test agents is labeled, and one may measure the amount of free label versus bound label to determine the effect on binding. </p>[00149] In some embodiments, binding assays involve exposing a biological target to a test agent and detecting binding between the biological target and the test agent. The binding assay may be conducted in vitro (e.g. in a test tube, comprising substantially only the components mentioned; in cell-free extracts; and/or in substantially purified \n\n components). Alternatively or additionally, the assays may be conducted in cyto and/or in vivo (e.g. within a cell, tissue, organ, and/or organism; described in further detail below). </p>[00150] In certain embodiments, a test agent is contacted with a biological target and an effect detected. In one assay, for example, a test agent is contacted with PRPK protein, and binding to PRPK protein is tested. Similar assays may be performed for TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. It will be appreciated that fragments, portions, homologs, variants, and/or derivatives of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and/or LAGE3 and its homologs may be employed. </p>[00151] In some embodiments, an assay for identifying agents that bind to a biological target, which is immobilized on a solid support, with a non-immobilized test agent is used to determine whether and/or to what extent the biological target and test agent bind to each other. Alternatively, the test agent may be immobilized and the biological target non- immobilized. Such assays may be used to identify agents capable of binding to PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. </p> [00152] In one embodiment, an antibody that recognizes the biological target (e.g. a PRPK antibody) is bound to a "
