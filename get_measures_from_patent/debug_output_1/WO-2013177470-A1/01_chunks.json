    "nd humans. Prior to this invention, it was hard to predict potential off-target binding contributions a pharmacokinetic profile prior to conducting such pharmacokinetic studies in vivo. We developed an inexpensive, higher throughput, in vitro assay that is simple to employ and can be used to help select therapeutic candidates with greater likelihood of having adequate pharmacokinetic properties and deselect therapeutic candidates with greater likelihood of having inadequate pharmacokinetic properties in non- human primates and humans. </p> The invention will now be described in detail by way of reference only using the following definitions and examples. All patents and publications, including all sequences disclosed within such patents and publications, referred to herein are expressly incorporated by reference. \n\n \"Therapeutic agent\" refers to an agent that may be useful in the treatment of a disease. In one embodiment, a therapeutic agent comprises on or more polypeptide sequences. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent comprises the sequence of an antibody. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent is an immunoconjugate. </p> \"BV\" as used herein refers to a baculovirus particle. </p> \"BV score\" as used herein refers to a value calculated from the mean of the values from multiple (2 or more) binding assays measuring the level of binding of a therapeutic agent to a baculovirus particle. </p> A \"normalized BV score\" refers to a BV score, wherein the value from each binding assay has been normalized prior to calculating the mean value. In one embodiment, normalization is achieved by dividing the value from each binding assay with BV by a value observed in a non-treated (i.e., without BV) assay. In one example, the OD value from each binding assay with BV is divided by the average value of the OD values observed for non-coated wells. </p> \"Increased risk\" or \"increased likelihood\" refers to the greater possibility that an event will happen. </p> \"Fast clearance\" refers to the clearance rate of an agent in a human or cyno. In one embodiment, a fast clearance rate is any rate that is greater than 10 mL/kg/day. In another embodiment, a fast clearance rate is any rate that is greater than 12mL/kg/day. </p> \"Desirable clearance\" refers to a desireable clearance rate of an agent in a human or cyno. In one embodiment, a desireable clearance rate is one that is 8.5 mL/kg/day or less. In another embodiment, a desireable clearance rate is one that is 12 mL/kg/day or less. </p> As used herein, the term \"immunoadhesin\" designates antibody-like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an \"adhesin\") with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is \"heterologous\"), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin can be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such a",
    "y to antigen. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain (VH and VL, respectively) of a native antibody generally have similar structures, with each domain comprising four conserved framework regions (FRs) and three hypervariable regions (HVRs). (See, e.g., Kindt et al. Kuby Immunology, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Co., page 91 (2007).) A single VH or VL domain may be sufficient to confer antigen-binding specificity. Furthermore, antibodies that bind a particular antigen may be isolated using a VH or VL domain from an antibody that binds the antigen to screen a library of complementary VL or VH \n\n domains, respectively. See, e.g., Portolano et al., J. Immunol. 150:880-887 (1993); Clarkson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991). </p> The term \"vector,\" as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of propagating another nucleic acid to which it is linked. The term includes the vector as a self-replicating nucleic acid structure as well as the vector incorporated into the genome of a host cell into which it has been introduced. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of nucleic acids to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" </p> In a further aspect, an antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections 1 -7 below: </p> 1. Antibody Affinity </p> In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &lt; 1 \u03bc\u039c, &lt; 100 nM, &lt; 10 nM, &lt; 1 nM, &lt; 0.1 nM, &lt; 0.01 nM, or &lt; 0.001 nM (e.g. 10-8 M or less, e.g. from 10-8 M to 10-13 M, e.g., from 10-9 M to 10-13 M). </p> In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER\u00ae multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0C). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [1251] -antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u00ae) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bc\u0390/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20 TM; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT TM gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. </p> According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE \u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\u00b0C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)- \n\n carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 tiM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20TM) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of </p>approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE \u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 106 M-l s-1 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm bandpass) at 25oC of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO TM spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. </p> 2. Antibody Fragments </p> In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH, F(ab')2, Fv, and scFv fragments, and other fragments described below. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9: 129-134 (2003). For a review of scFv fragments, see, e.g., Pluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., ( Springer- Verlag, New York), pp. 269- 315 (1994); see also WO 93/16185; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,571,894 and 5,587,458.

    " The hypothesis that fast clearance is associated with the synthetic library antibodies was investigated. Antibodies derived from synthetic human antibody phage libraries were selected and optimized through in vitro selectionl 8. Most of these required affinity maturation through amino acid \n\n changes in their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in order to achieve the required affinity and potency. Although many of the humanized antibodies also have CDR substitutions relative to the rodent sequence either to improve affinity or chemical stability, in general the humanized antibodies have been subjected to less in vitro optimization. A concern with in vitro selection is that it may inadvertently result in off-target interactions since the negative selection that can be performed in vitro is less extensive than can occur in vivol3. Nonetheless, a comparison of humanized and synthetic library derived antibodies indicates an overlapping range of clearance values (Fig. 3). The median clearance value is 6.5 mL/kg/day for humanized antibodies and 9.0 mL/kg/day for human antibodies from synthetic phage libraries. These data do not provide evidence for an association between the synthetic library antibodies and fast clearance (P = 0.28, Wilcoxon test). </p>Example 9 </p> Binding affinity to cynomolgus monkeys </p>In order to test if variations in FcRn binding could account for the range of clearance values observed, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods to determine KD values for binding of these antibodies to purified cynomolgus monkey FcRn at pH 5.8. Since IgG- FcRn binding is a relatively weak interaction, we used a steady-state approach described previously 1 1 to determine binding constants. Avidity effects arising from 2: 1 FcRn:IgG interaction were avoided by immobilizing each of the antibodies (n=44) that were available for analysis. KD values determined in this fashion ranged from about 250 nM to 1 ,500 nM. Since each antibody was separately immobilized using random coupling via amino groups, with a concomitant uncertainty in the orientation on the sensor chip surface, a range in KD values was not unexpected. Multiple (n=7) determinations of the KD for Pertuzumab indicated a mean of 940\u00b1140 (S.D.) nM. The measurement method can detect changes in FcRn affinity as we could reproduce binding effects (data not shown) for Fc mutants known to increase affinity for FcRn 19. The faster clearance observed for some antibodies is not due to an altered low pH binding affinity for cynomolgus monkey FcRn (Fig. 4). Indeed, a comparison of several antibodies with approximately identical FcRn binding affinities gave a nearly 30-fold range in clearance values. Separate experiments (data not shown) indicated that the rate of dissociation of cynomolgus monkey FcRn from these antibodies at pH 7.4 was rapid and equivalent across the panel tested. Although these experiments are insufficient to rule out a change in the recycling pathway for some antibodies as an explanation for the fast clearance observed, it appears unlikely that a significant change in binding affinity at pH 5.8 or in release kinetics at neutral pH play a major role in the fast clearance. \n\n Example 10 </p> Development of in vitro assay for risk mitigation of fast clearance</p>Fast clearance observed for a few antibodies has been associated with specific 14, 15 or non-specific 13, 16 off-target binding. During antibody generation and optimization, most of the antibodies in our panel were screened for lack of binding to closely related antigen homologues. In addition, many of the antibodies derived via phage display were selected in </p> 20 </p>the presence of additives to",
    "e selection through further engineering of antibody 47. This is a humanized antibody with amino acid changes in the CDRs both for affinity improvement and to remove potential sequence liabilities. Cynomolgus monkey is a non-target-binding species for antibody 47. No reproducible tissue staining was observed in monkeys with antibody 47, but a clearance of 20.2 mL/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys was determined for this antibody. A variant of antibody 47 that retained 2 of the affinity maturation changes, and an amino acid change to remove a potential N-linked glycosylation site in one of the heavy chain CDRs (antibody 47b), showed reduced binding in the BV ELISA (Table 2). Antibody 47c retains only the amino acid change to remove the potential N-linked glycosylation site and also had reduced BV binding. Separate experiments indicated that a large contribution to the BV binding of antibody 47 was made by the VL-D27cS change to remove a potential Asp-Gly isomerization site. Antibodies 47b and 47c had slower clearance relative to antibody 47 in cynomolgus monkeys (Table 2). </p>Example 11 </p>The broad distribution of clearance values in cynomolgus monkeys measured for this panel of antibodies, as well as the faster clearance (&gt; 10 mL/kg/day) observed for 15 of the antibodies, was unexpected. Since 40 out of the 52 antibodies have identical human IgGl Fc sequences, it was expected that faster clearance would not be associated with changes in FcRn interaction. Indeed, although the KD measured for FcRn binding at pH 5.8 varies over a 7-fold range, this is not associated with a trend in clearance values. Given that relatively large increases in pH 5.8 FcRn affinity lead to modest improvement in clearance <sup>19</sup> , it is not surprising that the small differences in FcRn affinity determined here do not have an impact on clearance. All of the antibodies tested showed equivalent and rapid release from FcRn at neutral pH. In contrast to the results reported by Wang et al <sup>22</sup> , we do not detect an association between clearance and an impact of the Fab portion of the antibody on FcRn release kinetics at neutral pH. Our study used a larger panel of antibodies and a different orientation of the SPR experiments to minimize avidity effects on binding. </p> Given that the greatest difference between antibodies in our panel is in the variable domains, and in particular in the CDRs, it is likely that differences in the composition of these domains \n\n contribute to the variability in clearance behavior. Other groups have observed effects on clearance associated with changes in CDR sequence that were not related to differences in binding affinity to the target antigen 13, 16. We do not find that clearance is associated with isoelectric point (pi) or hydrophobicity of the intact antibody (Suppl. Fig. 1 A, B). Igawa et al. <sup>23</sup> have previously shown that clearance of a human IgGl antibody in cynomolgus monkeys can be reduced through changes in the",
    "sk of having fast clearance in both humans and cynomolgus monkeys. This assay, based on antibody binding to virus particles prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells, employs a simple ELISA format and can be applied in high throughput fashion. Since pharmacokinetic data are determined in mammalian species, an assay based on non-specific binding to mammalian cells might have been expected to show a stronger correlation with fast clearance. Preliminary results indicated a correlation between fast clearance and non-specific binding to human 293 cells detected by FACS, but broad application of this assay was precluded because many of the cognate antigens for this collection of antibodies are expressed on 293 cells. The BV ELISA assay we have developed does not suffer from this target-expression limitation. For antibodies that can be evaluated with both assays, a similar trend in non-specific binding is observed (data not shown). Budded baculovirus virions are stable nanoparticles that mimic infected cell surfaces, presenting a complex mixture of phospholipid, carbohydrate, glycoproteins, extracellular matrix and nucleic acids as well as the viral capsid. <sup>24</sup>' <sup>25'</sup> The antigen presumably also contains some insect cell debris including protein, membranes and nucleic acids. Such a mixture lacking the specific targets of therapeutic antibodies while retaining the same overall biochemical complexity as human cells and tissues has advantages in a non-specific binding assay since it may detect different kinds of interactions, electrostatic versus hydrophobic for example, in different antibodies. </p> An important caveat to the association between antibody clearance in cynomolgus monkeys and binding to BV particles is that, other than for antibody 47, it is an observation based on data collected through normal preclinical development, rather than a designed experiment in which BV- \n\n particle binding was systematically varied. Clearance values were obtained from separate studies with widely-varying dose levels and using varying PK assay types. However, where sufficient data was available to make an assessment, the association between fast clearance in cynomolgus monkeys and BV binding was found to persist across dose levels, assay types and antibody sources and target types. </p> The risk of fast clearance can be reduced by using the assay to minimize introduction of nonspecific binding during engineering of an antibody. In antibody 47, both charge reduction and increased hydrophobicity were associated with increased non-specific binding to BV particles. </p>Variants with decreased non-specific binding had slower clearance. The BV ELISA is not expected to be a reliable assay of specific off-target effects. For example, the humanized antibody previously shown to have fast clearance in mice due to unintended specific binding to a complement protein <sup>14</sup> has no detectable binding to the BV particles (not shown). In our experie",
    " not all antibodies with rapid clearance in </p>cynomolgus monkeys, with few false positives. Therefore, the assay should be considered as a screening tool to reduce the number of therapeutic antibodies that need to be tested in NHP PK experiments and not as an assay that consistently predicts clearance in cynomolgus monkeys. When multiple candidates with similar potencies against a target are available, such that a small but non- zero rate of false positives is acceptable, this assay is a cost effective tool to minimize risk of fast clearance. The BV ELISA assay could be enhanced if the basis for the false negative results could be identified. Relative to membranes from mammalian cells, the phospholipid composition of insect cell membranes is enriched in phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl choline, and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, with lower levels of the acidic phospholipid phosphatidyl serine, cholesterol, glyco- and sphingolipids <sup>24</sup>. The higher amounts of neutral phospholipids may account for the false negatives in the assay if the faster clearance of these antibodies is related to binding to acidic phospholipids on mammalian membranes. Two of the four false negative antibodies have a high net positive charge calculated for the Fv domain. It will be interesting to explore whether the phospholipid composition of the BV particles can be manipulated through growth conditions or cell line differences with a concomitant improvement in the veracity of the non-specific binding assay. These studies could further illuminate features to be avoided during antibody engineering to maintain acceptable pharmacokinetic behavior. </p>Example 12 </p> Antibody clearance optimization </p> In this example we tested whether the BV ELISA could be used prospectively to help aid candidate selection through further engineering. \n\n Antibody 47 is a humanized antibody with amino acid changes in the CDRs both for affinity improvement and to remove potential sequence liabilities. Cynomolgus monkey is a non-target- binding species for antibody 47. No reproducible tissue staining was observed in monkeys with antibody 47, but a clearance of 20.2 mL/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys was determined for this antibody. A variant of antibody 47 that retained 2 of the affinity maturation changes, and an amino acid change to remove a potential N-linked glycosylation site in one of the heavy chain CDRs (antibody 47b), showed reduced binding in the BV ELISA (Table 1).
