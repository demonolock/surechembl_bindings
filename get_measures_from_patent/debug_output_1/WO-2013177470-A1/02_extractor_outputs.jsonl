{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of < 1 \u03bc\u039c, < 100 nM, < 10 nM, < 1 nM, < 0.1 nM, < 0.01 nM, or < 0.001 nM (e.g. 10-8 M or less, e.g. from 10-8 M to 10-13 M, e.g., from 10-9 M to 10-13 M).\n* According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE \u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\u00b0C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU), with antigen diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein.\n* For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 tiM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20TM) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min.\n* If the on-rate exceeds 106 M-l s-1 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm bandpass) at 25oC of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO TM spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette."}
