    "ity), and concanavalin A2 (high affinity), are potent at inhibiting Na+ dependent phosphate co-transport and vitamin D metabolism in a human renal cell line (CL8). The high affinity fraction, the human renal cell line (CL8), and the conditions used for assay are described in Rowe et al 1996. A further suitable known renal cell line for this assay is the OK cell line deposited as ECACC 91021202.</p>Cation Exchange Chromatography Using HiTrap SP Cation Exchange 1 ml Column (Code No 17-1151-01; Pharmacia):</p>1.

Both the Concanavalin A and cation bands also have an aggregated form. All fractions including the tumor conditioned media were potent at inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup> dependent phosphate co-transport in a human renal cell line (1/1000 diln), and also altered vitamin D metabolism. For a full description of the methods used to measure phosphate transport and vitamin D metabolism see Rowe et a/1996. All purification modalities were carried out on a waters HPLC/FPLC system programmed by computer-millennium software. The most active fraction was the concanavalin A1 fraction from OHO tumor. Anti pre-operation antisera was used to screen the immobilized purified fraction. The fraction is also potent at inhibiting NaPi, and affects vitamin D metabolism in a human renal cell line (CL8).</p>EXAMPLE 2Screening of Tumor Conditioned-medium (TCM), and Purified Fractions with Pre/Post-operation Antisera: Plus Glycoprotein ScreenPre-operation and post-operation antisera from a patient has been described previously in Rowe et at 1996. Only pre-operation antisera detected the purified fractions and hormone in TCM in which Western and glycoprotein detection of TCM and purified fractions was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein markers were biotinylated, and tagged with streptavidin peroxidase conjugate. The arrows show the aggregate and active glycoprotein. Post-operation antisera and rabbit pre-immune sera did not detect any of the fractions. A"
