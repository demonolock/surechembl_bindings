    "sub>4</sub> and concentrated. The crude material was purified by flash column chromatography (0-50 % EtOAc in petroleum ether).</p>General Procedure CA flame dried three necked round bottom flask was purged with the stream of argon. The flask was equipped with septum, thermometer and argon balloon and charged with the mixture of abs. toluene (1.0 ml toluene/1.0 mmol ester) and ester. To the reaction mixture the catalyst solution was added in one portion, followed by the dropwise addition of silane, maintaining the internal temperature between 20-30\u00b0C. The reaction mixture was stirred for overnight. The reaction was monitored by TLC (hexane/ethyl acetate 9/1, PMA visualization and if different, it is specified in the example). After reaction completion 1 ml EtOAc, 0.6 ml MeCN and silica gel were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for further 10 mins and filtered off the silica gel and washed with 2\u00d725 ml n-pentane. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product that was purified by flash column chromatography or simple filtration via a short pad of silica to give the product.</p>General Procedure DA MW reaction vial was charged with \u03c9-bromo alkyl silyl mixed acetal, amine, abs. acetonitrile (1.0 mmol \u03c9-bromo alkyl silyl mixed acetal/4.0 ml of abs. acetonitrile) and abs. cyclopentyl methyl ether (\u03c9-bromo alkyl silyl mixed acetal/1.33 ml of abs. cyclopentyl methyl ether). To the stirred reaction mixture K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (2.0 eq.) and KI (0.2 eq.) were added and purged with argon and sealed. The resulting mixture was stirred for 18 hours at 62\u00b0C. Then the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and partitioned between ethyl acetate and brine and stirred vigorously for 15 minutes. The organic phase was separated and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography</p>General Procedure EA MW reaction vial was charged with 1.0 eq. propargyl amine derivative, 1.5 eq. azide derivative, 0.33 eq. CuBr, 0.33 eq. 1,1,4,7,7-Pentamethyldiethylenetriamine and abs. DMF (0.1 mmol propargyl amine derivative/3.0 ml of abs. DMF) and purged with argon and sealed. The resulting mixture was stirred for 20 h at 50\u00b0C. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness under vacuum and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography.</p>Examples of the ester synthesisExample 1Synthesis of (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yl 6-bromohexanoate(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yl 6-bromohexanoate was prepared from 6-bromohexanoic acid and linoleyl alcohol according to general procedure A.
