    " ESP-02, ESP-03 and ESP-04) of different gradient eluents of sodium chloride, rotary evaporating at 60deg.C, concentrating, and dialyzing for 48 hr to obtain four different elution parts of the Anthriscus sylvestris polysaccharide.</p>EXAMPLE 2DPPH radical scavenging experiment</p>The DPPH solution is prepared by taking 2mg of DPPH powder, precisely weighing, fixing the volume to a volumetric flask of 50ml by absolute ethyl alcohol, and preserving at 4 \u2103 in dark for standby.</p>According to the reaction system of Table 1, the sample is added into a 96-well plate, placed in a shaking table, uniformly mixed for 30min at room temperature and in the dark, absorbance is measured at 517nm of an enzyme-labeled instrument, and Vc is used as a positive control. Clearance was calculated in triplicate and IC <sub>50</sub> values and IC index were calculated using SPSS25.0 software.</p>TABLE 1 composition and amount (. Mu.L) of reaction solution for DPPH radical scavenging test</p></p></p>DPPH radical scavenging ratio = [ (A-D) - (C-D) ]/(A-D). Times.100%, wherein A, C, D is the absorbance value measured for each of the above groups, respectively.</p>The results show that the IC <sub>50</sub> values of different Emei polysaccharide components (ESP-01, ESP-02, ESP-03 and ESP-04) on the DPPH free radical scavenging capacity are shown in Table 2, and the scavenging capacity is ESP-02&gt; ESP-01&gt; ESP-03&gt; ESP-04, and the invention takes ESP-02 as a follow-up research object.</p>TABLE 2 IC50 values for radical scavenging by different Emei polysaccharides</p></p>EXAMPLE 3 study of the protective Effect of Emei polysaccharide ESP-02 on apoptosis of HaCaT cells irradiated with blue light</p>The HaCaT cells are inoculated into a 96-well plate at the density of 5 x 10 <sup>3</sup> cells/well, when the cell fusion degree is 60% -70%, the culture solution is discarded, and the HaCaT cells are irradiated by a blue light irradiation instrument (430 nm-440 nm) in a 40J/cm <sup>2</sup> metering manner according to the group of the table 4. After irradiation, the cells were incubated in an incubator at 37\u2103with 5% CO <sub>2</sub>, the medium was discarded, the PBS was used for 3 times, 10. Mu. LMTT solution was added to each well, the incubation was continued for 4 hours, the cell supernatant was discarded, 150. Mu.L DMSO (analytically pure) solution was added to each well, the absorbance OD value of each well was measured at 490nm, and the relative activities of each group of cells were calculated according to the following formula.</p></p>A control group</p>Administration group (or model group)</p>Table 4 experimental grouping and processing method</p></p></p>Experimental results show that the comparison of the model group and the control group shows that P is less than 0.001, and that the ESP-02 groups of 1%, 2% and 4% have significant differences relative to the model group. Thus, blue light irradiation of HaCaT cells causes apoptosis, while different concentrations "
