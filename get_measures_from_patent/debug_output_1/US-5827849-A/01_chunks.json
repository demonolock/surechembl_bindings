    "ainst the concentration of test substance, and the concentration for 50% inhibition of binding is found.</p>B. Antithrombotic effect</p>Method</p>Platelet aggregation is measured by the method of Born and Cross (J. Physiol. 170, 397 (1964)) in platelet-rich plasma from healthy test subjects. For anticoagulation, sodium citrate 3.14% is added to the blood in the ratio 1:10 by volume.</p>Collagen-induced aggregation</p>The course of the decrease in optical density of the platelet suspension is measured and recorded photometrically after addition of the aggregation-inducing substance. The rate of aggregation is established from the angle of inclination of the density plot. The point on the plot at which the transmission of light is a maximum is used to calculate the optical density.</p>The amount of collagen is chosen to be as small as possible but sufficient for the reaction plot to have an irreversible course. The collagen commercially obtainable from Hormonchemie, Munich, is used.</p>Before the addition of collagen the plasma is in each case incubated with the substance at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes.</p>An EC<sub>50</sub> which relates to a 50% change in the optical density in the sense of inhibition of aggregation is determined graphically from the measured results.</p>The following table contains the results found:</p>______________________________________                                    \n             Fibrinogen Inhibition of                                     \nSubstance    binding assay                                                \n                        platelet aggregation                              \n(Example No).                                                             \n             IC.sub.50  nM!                                               \n                        EC.sub.50  nM!                                    \n______________________________________                                    \n32           11         100                                               \n32 (3)       15         81                                                \n32 (1)       250        310                                               \n32 (2)       1000       2300                                              \n35 (1)       17         110                                               \n36 (1)       77         290                                               \n36 (2)       19         210                                               \n36 (3)       18         71                                                \n32 (6)       31         230                                               \n36 (10)      32         130                                               \n36 (12)      13         450                                               \n______________________________________                                    \n</pre></p>Because of their inhibitory effect on cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, the novel cyclic urea derivatives of the general formula XXI and their phys"
