    " ubiquitous tissue expression, ALK3 displays a restricted pattern of expression consistent with more specialized functionality (ten Dijke, 1993, Oncogene 8:2879-2887). ALK3 is generally recognized as a high affinity receptor for BMP2, BMP4, BMP7 and other members of the BMP family. BMP2 and BMP7 are potent stimulators of osteoblastic differentiation, and are now used clinically to induce bone formation in spine fusions and certain non-union fractures. ALK3 is regarded as a key receptor in mediating BMP2 and BMP4 signaling in osteoblasts (Lavery et al., 2008, J. Biol. Chem. 283:20948-20958). A homozygous ALK3 knockout mouse dies early in embryogenesis (day 9.5), however, adult mice carrying a conditional disruption of ALK3 in osteoblasts have been recently reported to exhibit increased bone mass, although the newly formed bone showed evidence of disorganization (Kamiya, 2008, J. Bone Miner. Res. 23:2007-2017; Kamiya, 2008, Development 135:3801-3811). This finding is in startling contrast to the effectiveness of BMP2 and BMP7 (ligands for ALK3) as bone building agents in clinical use.</p>As demonstrated herein, a soluble ALK3 polypeptide (ALK3-Fc), which shows substantial preference in binding to BMP2 and BMP4 is effective to promote bone growth and increase bone density in vivo. While not wishing to be bound to any particular mechanism, it is expected that the effect of ALK3 is caused primarily by a BMP antagonist effect, given the very strong BMP2 and BMP4 binding (picomolar dissociation constant) exhibited by the particular soluble ALK3 construct used in these studies. Regardless of mechanism, it is apparent from the data presented herein that BMP-ALK3 antagonists do increase bone density in normal mice. Surprisingly, the bone generated by treatment with ALK3-Fc shows no evidence of the type of disorganization observed in the ALK3 conditional knockout mice. It should be noted that bone is a dynamic tissue, with growth or shrinkage and increased or decreased density depending on a balance of factors that produce bone and stimulate mineralization (primarily osteoblasts) and factors that destroy and demineralize bone (primarily osteoclasts). Bone growth and mineralization may be increased by increasing the productive factors, by decreasing the destructive factors, or both. The terms \"promote bone growth\" and \"increase bone mineralization\" refer to the observable physical changes in bone and are intended to be neutral as to the mechanism by which changes in bone occur.</p>The mouse model for bone growth/density that was used in the studies described herein is considered to be highly predictive of efficacy in humans, and therefore, this disclosure provides methods for using ALK3 polypeptides and other BMP-ALK3 antagonists to promote bone growth and increase bone density in humans. BMP-ALK3 antagonists include, for example, BMP-binding soluble ALK3 polypeptides, antibodies that bind to BMP and disrupt ALK3 binding, antibodies that bind to ALK3 and dis",
    "tion may bind to and inhibit the function of an ALK3 protein and/or BMPs. Preferably, an ALK3 polypeptide promotes bone growth and bone mineralization. Examples of ALK3 polypeptides include human ALK3 precursor polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) and soluble human ALK3 polypeptides (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 3, 7, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41).</p>The human ALK3 precursor protein sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) is shown in Figure 1, and the nucleic acid sequence encoding human ALK3 precursor protein (SEQ ID NO: 2; nucleotides 549-2144 of Genbank entry NM_004329) is shown in Figure 2. The human ALK3 soluble (extracellular), processed polypeptide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) is shown in Figure 3, and the nucleic acid sequence encoding the human ALK3 extracellular domain (SEQ ID NO: 4; nucleotides 618-1004 of Genbank entry NM_004329) is shown in Figure 4.</p>In a specific embodiment, the invention relates to soluble ALK3 polypeptides. As described herein, the term \"soluble ALK3 polypeptide\" generally refers to polypeptides comprising an extracellular domain of an ALK3 protein. The term \"soluble ALK3 polypeptide,\" as used herein, includes any naturally occurring extracellular domain of an ALK3 protein as well as any variants thereof (including mutants, fragments and peptidomimetic forms). A BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide is one that retains the ability to bind to BMPs, particularly BMP2 and BMP4. Preferably, a BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide will bind to BMP with a dissociation constant of 1 nM or less. The amino acid sequence of human ALK3 precursor protein is provided in Figure 1. The extracellular domain of an ALK3 protein binds to BMP and is generally soluble, and thus can be termed a soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide. Examples of soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptides include the soluble polypeptide illustrated in SEQ ID NOs: 3, 7, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41. SEQ ID NO:7 is referred to as ALK3(24-152)-hFc, and is described further in the Examples. Other examples of soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptides comprise a signal sequence in addition to the extracellular domain of an ALK3 protein, for example, the native ALK3 leader sequence (SEQ ID NO: 8), the tissue plaminogen activator (TPA) leader (SEQ ID NO: 9) or the honey bee melittin leader (SEQ ID NO: 10). The ALK3-hFc polypeptide illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 11 uses a TPA leader.</p>Functionally active fragments of ALK3 polypeptides can be obtained by screening polypeptides recombinantly produced from the corresponding fragment of the nucleic acid encoding an ALK3 polypeptide. In addition, fragments can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art such as conventional Merrifield solid phase f-Moc or t-Boc chemistry. The fragments can be produced (recombinantly or by chemical synthesis) and tested to identify those peptidyl fragments that can function as antagonists (inhibitors) of ALK3 protein or signaling mediated",
    "with myeloma cells to obtain antibody-producing hybridomas, and testing the antibody-producing hybridomas to identify a hybridoma that produces a monocolonal antibody that binds specifically to the antigen. Once obtained, a hybridoma can be propagated in a cell culture, optionally in culture conditions where the hybridoma-derived cells produce the monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the antigen. The monoclonal antibody may be purified from the cell culture.</p>The adjective \"specifically reactive with\" as used in reference to an antibody is intended to mean, as is generally understood in the art, that the antibody is sufficiently selective between the antigen of interest (e.g., an ALK3 polypeptide) and other antigens that are not of interest that the antibody is useful for, at minimum, detecting the presence of the antigen of interest in a particular type of biological sample. In certain methods employing the antibody, such as therapeutic applications, a higher degree of specificity in binding may be desirable. Monoclonal antibodies generally have a greater tendency (as compared to polyclonal antibodies) to discriminate effectively between the desired antigens and cross-reacting polypeptides. One characteristic that influences the specificity of an antibody:antigen interaction is the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Although the desired specificity may be reached with a range of different affinities, generally preferred antibodies will have an affinity (a dissociation constant) of about 10<sup>-6</sup>, 10<sup>-7</sup>, 10<sup>-8</sup>, 10<sup>-9</sup> or less. Given the extraordinarily tight binding between BMPs and ALK3, it is expected that a neutralizing anti-BMP or anti-ALK3 antibody would generally have a dissociation constant of 10<sup>-9</sup> or less.</p>In addition, the techniques used to screen antibodies in order to identify a desirable antibody may influence the properties of the antibody obtained. For example, if an antibody is to be used for binding an antigen in solution, it may be desirable to test solution binding. A variety of different techniques are available for testing interaction between antibodies and antigens to identify particularly desirable antibodies. Such techniques include ELISAs, surface plasmon resonance binding assays (e.g., the Biacore\u2122 binding assay, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), sandwich assays (e.g., the paramagnetic bead system of IGEN International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland), western blots, immunoprecipitation assays, and immunohistochemistry.</p>Examples of categories of nucleic acid compounds that are BMP or ALK3 antagonists include antisense nucleic acids, RNAi constructs and catalytic nucleic acid constructs. A nucleic acid compound may be single or double stranded. A double stranded compound may also include regions of overhang or non-complementarity, where one or the other of the strands is single stranded. A single stranded compound may include regions of self-complementarity, meaning that the compound forms a so-called \"hairpin\" or \"stem-loop\" structure, with a region of double helical structure. A nucleic acid compound may comprise a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region consisting of no more than 1000, no more than 500, no more than 250, no more than 100 or no more than 50, 35, 30, 25, 22, 20 or 18 nucleotides of the full-length ALK3 nucleic acid sequence or BMP nucleic acid sequence. The region of complementarity will preferably be at least 8 nucleotides, and optionally at least 10 or at least 15 nucleotides, and optionally between 15 and 25 nucleotides. A region of complementarity may fall within an intron, a coding sequence or a noncoding sequence of the target transcript, such as the coding sequence portion. Generally, a nucleic acid compound will have a length of about",
    "lthough ALK3C\u039412 retains binding to BMP7 at an affinity similar to the full-length ALK3 ECD. In contrast, N-terminal truncations tend to reduce binding to BMP2, abolish binding to BMP4, and display varying effects on binding to BMP6/BMP7. Interestingly, the double-truncated variant ALK3N\u03946C\u03946 displays increased affinity for BMP2/BMP4 compared to full-length ALK3 ECD, in combination with undetectable binding to BMP6/BMP7. Molecules with greater selectivity for the desired targets, BMP2 and BMP4 are useful because they will have fewer \"off target\" effects in patients. N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that the nucleic acid encoding a six amino acid truncation at the N-terminus, when expressed in cell culture, gave rise to a population of polypeptides having the six amino acid truncation and a population of polypeptides having a seven amino acid truncation. Taken together, these demonstrate that hALK3-hFc polypeptides containing up to a seven amino acid truncation at the N-terminus and up to a twelve amino acid truncation at the C-terminus retain useful activity and demonstrate the desirable and surprising reduction in binding to off-target ligands. Thus, an ALK3 polypeptide comprising at least amino acids 8 to 117 of SEQ ID NO:3 may be used for the purposes described herein.</p>Ligand binding properties were used to compare the quality of hALK3(24-152)-hFc protein derived from CHO cells with that derived from HEK 293 cells. As determined by Biacore\u2122 methodology, the affinity (Kd) of BMP2 for hALK3(24-152)-hFc did not differ depending on the source of fusion protein; however, the percentage of active protein generated by CHO cells was higher than that of HEK 293 cells based on their respective Rmax values. Rmax is a measure of protein quality equal to (MW<sub>A</sub>/MW<sub>L</sub>) x R<sub>L</sub> x S<sub>M</sub>, where MW<sub>A</sub> is the molecular weight of analyte, MW<sub>L</sub> is the molecular weight of ligand, R<sub>L</sub> in the immobilization level in response units, and S<sub>M</sub> is the molar stoichiometry. Corresponding analysis of BMP4 binding revealed that protein derived from CHO cells exhibited higher affinity for BMP4 than did that from HEK 293 cells (K<sub>D</sub>s of 314 pM vs. 1020 pM, respectively), and the Rmax value for protein generated by CHO cells was three times that for protein from HEK 293 cells, again indicating a higher percentage of active protein. Therefore, unexpected benefits of CHO cells as the source of hALK3(24-152)-hFc protein include higher binding affinity of protein to BMP4 and greater bioavailability predicted to result from higher protein quality (Rmax value).</p>Example 3. hALK3-mFc Improves Bone Status in MiceApplicants investigated the ability of a version of ALK3-mFc to improve bone status in mice. Twelve-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per group) were treated with hALK3(24-152)-mFc, 10 mg/kg, or vehicle (Tris-buffered saline) by intraperitoneal injection twice per week for a total of six w",
