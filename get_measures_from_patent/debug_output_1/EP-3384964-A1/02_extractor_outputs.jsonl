{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences:\n\nAs determined by Biacore\u2122 methodology, the affinity (Kd) of BMP2 for hALK3(24-152)-hFc did not differ depending on the source of fusion protein; however, the percentage of active protein generated by CHO cells was higher than that of HEK 293 cells based on their respective Rmax values.\nCorresponding analysis of BMP4 binding revealed that protein derived from CHO cells exhibited higher affinity for BMP4 than did that from HEK 293 cells (KDs of 314 pM vs. 1020 pM, respectively), and the Rmax value for protein generated by CHO cells was three times that for protein from HEK 293 cells, again indicating a higher percentage of active protein."}
