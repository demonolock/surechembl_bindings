    " chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory agents, or radiation, are well known in the art. These might include combination treatments with other therapeutic agents, such as but not limited to one or more the following: interferon-b, for example, IFN[:S- la and IFN-b-I b; a protein that simulates myelin basic protein; corticosteroids; IL-1 inhibitors; TNF inhibitors; anti-TNFa antibodies, anti-IL-6 antibodies , IL-lbr-Ig fusion, anti-IL-23 antibodies, antibodies to CD40 ligand and CD80; antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, e.g., antagonists of a p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 (e.g., inhibitory antibodies against the p40 subunit); IL-22 antagonists; small molecule inhibitors, e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, sirolimus (rapamycin) and analogs thereof, e.g., CCI-779; Cox-2 and cPLA2 inhibitors; NSAIDs; p38 inhibitors; TPL-2; Mk-2; NFkb inhibitors; RAGE or soluble RAGE; P-selectin or PSGL-1 inhibitors (e.g., small molecule inhibitors, antibodies thereto, e.g., antibodies to P- selectin); estrogen receptor beta (ERB) agonists or ERB-NFl^] antagonists. </p> Additionally, the combination treatment useful for administration with the IL-10 variant molecules or fusion proteins thereof may include TNF inhibitors include, e.g., chimeric, humanized, effectively human, human or in vitro generated antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, that bind to TNF; soluble fragments of a TNF receptor, e.g., p55 or p75 human TNF receptor or derivatives thereof, e.g., 75 kdTNFR-IgG (75 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein, ENBREL\u2122), p55 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein; and TNF enzyme antagonists, e.g., TNFa converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitors. Other combination treatment with anti-inflammatory agents/drugs that includes, but not limited to standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. NSAID may include aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac, diflunisal, etodolac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, nabumetone, naproxen, oxaprozin, piroxicam, salsalate, sulindac, and/or tolmetin. The cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor employed in compositions according to the application could, for example, be celecoxib or rofecoxib. </p> Additional therapeutic agents that can be co-administered and/or co-formulated with IL-10 variant molecules or fusion proteins thereof include one or more of: interferon-b, for example, IFN b-la and IFN b-1b; COPAXONE\u00ae; corticosteroids; IL-1 inhibitors; TNF antagonists (e.g., a soluble fragment of a TNF receptor, e.g., p55 or p75 human TNF receptor or derivatives thereof, e.g., 75 kdTNFR-IgG; antibodies to CD40 ligand and CD80; and antagonists of IL-12 and/or IL-23, e.g., antagonists of a p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 (e.g., inhibitory antibodies that bind to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23); methotrexate, \n\n leflunomide, and a sirolimus (rapamycin) or an analog thereof, e.g., CCI-779. Other therapeutic agents may include Imfimzi or Atezolizumb. </p> For purposes of treating NASH, for example, the IL-10 variant molecules or fusion proteins ther"
