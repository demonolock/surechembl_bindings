    "s in their target fields; the disruption of synaptic communication is manifested by mental impairments and, finally, severe dementia. The brains of individuals with AD exhibit characteristic lesions termed senile (or amyloid) plaques, amyloid angiopathy (amyloid deposits in blood vessels) and neurofibrillary tangles. Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restricted anatomical distribution are also found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) and Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type (HCHWA-D). Two types of protein aggregates found in the brain are pathological hallmark of AD: intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques (for a recent review see Wong et al, Nature Neurosci., 2002, 5: 633-639). Both tangles and plaques are preferentially localized to the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Neurofibrillary tangles are inclusions located within cell bodies and proximal dendrites, and within filamentous swellings in distal axons and synaptic terminals. Hyperphosphorylated iso forms of the microtubule- associated protein tau, which assemble into poorly soluble paired helical filaments, are a central feature of these neurofibrillary tangles (Goedert et al, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 1998, 8: 619-632). The extracellular plaques result from elevated levels of an approximately 4.2 kilodalton (kD) protein of about 39-43 amino acids designated the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) or sometimes \u03b2AP, A\u03b2P or \u03b2/A4 (see, e.g., Glenner and Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 120:885-890, 1984; U.S. Patent No. 4,666,829). Molecular biological and protein chemical analyses have shown that A\u03b2 is a small fragment of a much larger precursor protein, referred to \n\nas the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (see, e.g., Lahiri et al, Drug Dev. Res., 56:267-281, 2002; Selkoe, Physiol. Rev., 81:741-766, 2001). APP is a type I transmembrane protein normally expressed in many different cell types, but particularly abundant in neurons. A\u03b2 monomers form oligomers and multimers, which assemble into protofilaments and then fibrils. Eventually, A\u03b2 fibrils are deposited as the amyloid cores of neuritic or senile plaques (amyloidosis), which are complex structures also containing dystrophic neurites, astrocytes and microglia. Amyloid peptides are generated via cleavage of APP by three different proteases, termed \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. \u03b2-secretase, cleaves APP on the amino side of A\u03b2 producing a large secreted derivative, sAPP\u03b2, and an A\u03b2-bearing membrane-associated C-terminal derivative, CTF\u03b2, which is subsequently cleaved by the second activity, \u03b3-secretase, to release A\u03b2. Alternatively, a third activity, \u03b1-secretase, cleaves APP within A\u03b2 to the secreted derivative sAPP\u03b1 and membrane-associated CTF\u03b1. The predominant secreted APP derivative is sAPP\u03b1 in most cell types. Most of the secreted A\u03b2 is 40",
    "wn in the art for the measurement of amyloid peptide levels can be used in the practice of the instant invention. Such procedures include but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \"sandwich\" immunoassays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement- fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, western blots, protein A immunoassays, and immunoelectrophoresis assays, combinations thereof and the like. Generally speaking, the method for quantitative measurement of amyloid peptide involves capture of the \n\namyloid peptide with a first capture-antibody, washing away all unbound components, and detecting the remaining complex with a second detection-antibody. Preferably, the immunoassay designs are based on numerous \"capture and detection-antibody\" combinations, and may involve combinations of antibodies, provided that each antibody reacts with separate epitopes. In a specific embodiment, the method of the invention comprises using A\u03b2 peptide antibodies to capture and detect the presence of A\u03b2 in the body fluid. Accordingly, in a particular aspect, the present invention provides specific binding assays which are useful for the measurement of A\u03b2 concentrations in fluid samples and which may be employed in both the screening and diagnostic methods of the invention. The specific binding assay of the present invention is capable of detecting soluble A\u03b2 at the very low concentrations which are characteristic of the patient fluids and conditioned culture media, typically being capable of measuring threshold concentrations in the range from about 1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml, or lower. Specific binding assays according to the present invention employ at least one binding substance specific for an epitope or determinant site on the A\u03b2 molecule, which site is generally not found on other fragments or degradation products of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Particularly useful are antibodies which recognize a junction region within A\u03b2, where the junction region is located about the site of normal proteolytic cleavage of APP between residues Lys<sup>16</sup> and Leu<sup>17</sup> (Esch et al, Science, 248:1122-1124, 1990; Anderson et al, Neuroscience Lett., 128:126-128, 1991), typically spanning amino acid residues 13 and 28. Exemplary specific binding assays include two-site (sandwich) assays in which the capture antibody is specific for the junction region of A\u03b2, as just described, and a labeled second antibody is specific for an epitope other than the epitope recognized by the capture antibody. Particularly useful are second antibodies which bind to the amino-terminal end of A\u03b2, typically recognizing an epitope within amino acid residues 1-16. hi another aspect, the present invention provides a system for detecting soluble A\u03b2 in a fluid sample. The system inc",
    " directed against a second epitope of the antigen binds to the antigen captured by mAb 1 and completes the sandwich. After removal of unbound mAb 2 by washing, a substrate solution is added to the wells. In certain embodiments, a colored product is formed in proportion to the amount of antigen present in the sample. The reaction is terminated by addition of stop solution and absorbance may be measured spectrophotometrically or, in some embodiments, the product may be detected fluorometrically. In preferred embodiments, the antibodies for use in the present invention are specific only for A\u03b2 peptide. In certain embodiments, the assay method of the present invention can be provided in the form of a kit, e.g. , a packaged combination of instructions for carrying out the assay, capture antibody, and solid support for immobilization as described hereinafter. In addition, a detection means may also be included, such as an antibody to the A\u03b2 peptide, which may be labeled or unlabeled, as well as other additives, such as for example, stabilizers, washing, and incubation buffers, and the like. Kits of the present invention, also will typically include a means for containing the reagents in close confinement for commercial sale such as, e.g., injection or blow-molded \n\nplastic containers. Other containers suitable for conducting certain steps of the disclosed methods also may be provided.</p>\n  Definitions The term \"\u03b2-amyloid peptide\" (A\u03b2) as used herein refers to an approximately 4.2 kD protein which, in the brains of subjects, e.g., suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down's Syndrome, or HCHWA-D and some normal aged subjects, forms the subunit of the amyloid filaments comprising the senile (amyloid) plaques and the amyloid deposits in small cerebral and meningeal blood vessels (amyloid angiopathy). A\u03b2 can occur in a filamentous polymeric form (in this form, it exhibits the Congo-red and thioflavin-S dye-binding characteristics of amyloid described in connection therewith). A\u03b2 can also occur in a non- filamentous form (\"preamyloid\" or \"amorphous\" or \"diffuse\" deposits) in tissue, in which form no detectable birefringent staining by Congo red occurs. A portion of this protein in the insoluble form obtained from meningeal blood vessels is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,666,829. A\u03b2 when used in connection with this invention, specifically refers to an approximately 39-43 amino acid peptide which can be found in and purified from the extracellular fluid (medium) of cultured cells grown in vitro or from body fluids of humans and other mammals, including both normal individuals and individuals suffering from A\u03b2-related conditions. However, amino truncated A\u03b2 peptides, which are referred to as A\u03b2<sub>x-40</sub> have also been detected in the extracellular fluid (medium) by the assay used herein Thus, A\u03b2 also refers to related A\u03b2 sequences that result from mutations in the A\u03b2 region of the normal gene. In whatever form, A\u03b2 is an approximately 39-43 amino acid fragment, or A\u03b2<sub>x- 0</sub>, of a large membrane-spanning glycoprotein, referred to as the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP), encoded by a gene on the long arm of human chromosome 21. A\u03b2 is further characterized by its relative mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Its 43-amino acid sequence is:</p>\n  AspAlaGluPheArgHisAspSerGlyTyrGluValHisHisGlnLysLeuValPhePheAlaGluAspValGlySer AsnLysGlyAlallelleGlyLeuMetValGlyGlyNalNallleAlaThr (SEQ 3D NO: 1) or a sequence that is substantially homologous thereto. \n\n The term \" A\u03b2 peptides\" as used herein refers to intact or full length A\u03b2 as well as to fragments and degradation products of A\u03b2 which are generated at low concentrations by mammalian cells. Particular A\u03b2 fragments have a molecular weight of approximately 3 kD and are presently believed to consist of amino acid residues 11-40 and 17-40 of A\u03b2. The term \"A\u03b2 junction region\" as used herein refers to a region of A\u03b2 which is centered at tire site between amino acid residues 16 and 17 (Lys<sup>16</sup> and Leu<sup>17</sup>) which is a target for normal proteolytic processing of APP. Such normal processing results in a variety of APP fragments which are potentially immunologically cross-reactive with the intact A\u03b2 molecule and fragments of A\u03b2 which are to be identified in the methods of the present invention. The junction region will span amino acid residues 10 to 35, preferably spanning amino acid residues 15 to 30, with antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide consisting of amino acid residues 13-28 having been found to display the requisite specificity. The term \"\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein\" or \"APP\" as used herein is defined as a polypeptide that is encoded by a gene of the same name localized in humans on the long arm of chromosome 21 and that includes A\u03b2 within its carboxyl third. APP is a glycosylated, single- membrane-spanning protein expressed in a wide variety of cells in many mammalian tissues. Examples of specific isotypes of APP which are currently known to exist in humans are the 695- amino acid polypeptide described by Kang et al. (Nature, 325:733-736, i987) which is designated as the \"normal\" APP; the 751-amino acid polypeptide described by Ponte et al. (Nature, 331:525-527, 1988) and Tanzi et al. (Nature, 331:528-",
    "only a single copy of the mutant gene is necessary to cause the disease). Such mutations are identified in at least three different genes: APP, presenilin 1 (PS1) \n\nandpresenilin 2 (PS2) (Price et al, Annu. Rev. Genet., 1998, 32: 461-493; Hardy et al, Science, 1998, 282: 1075-1079; Tanzi, Neuron, 2001, 32: 181-184; Selkoe, ibid., pp. 177-180; Sherrington etal, Nature, 1995, 375: 754-760; Levy-Lahad etal, Science, 1995, 269: 973-977; Rogaev et al, Nature, 1995, 376: 775-778). A variety of APP mutations reported in cases of FAD (familial AD) are near cleavage sites involved in formation of A\u03b2 (see, e.g., Goate et al, 1991, Nature, 349:704-706; Harlan et al, 1991, Nature, 353:844-846; Mu\u03c0ell et al, 1991, Science, 254:97-99; and MuUan et al, 1992, Nature Genet., 1 :345-347). The APP 717 mutation is located near the C-terminus of A\u03b2 and facilitates \u03b2-secretase activity, leading to increased secretion of the longer and more toxic A\u03b2 peptide, A\u03b2 <sub>2</sub>. This longer A\u03b2 <sub>2</sub> peptide is thought to promote the formation of A\u03b2 aggregates and amyloid plaques. The APPswe mutation, a double mutation at the N-terminus of A\u03b2, enhances BACE1 cleavage and is associated with elevated levels of A\u03b2 peptides, including A\u03b2 <sub>2</sub>. hi contrast, APP mutations within the A\u03b2 peptide domain (for example, APP-E693Q, A692G or E693G) do not elevate the level of A\u03b2 but may cause amyloidosis by increasing A\u03b2 oligomer or protofibril formation. PS1 and PS2 encode highly homologous 43- to 50-kD multipass transmembrane proteins that are processed to stable N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, and are widely expressed but at low abundance in the central nervous system. PS1 influences APP processing (Borchelt et al. Neuron, 1997, 19: 939-945; Wong et al, 2002, supra). The PS1 gene has been reported to harbor more than 80 different FAD mutations (see AD mutation database, http://molgen-www.uia.ac.be), whereas only a small number of mutations have been found in PS2-linked families. The vast majority of abnormalities in PS genes are missense mutations that result in single amino acid substitutions, which in general seem to influence secretase activity and increase the generation of the A\u03b2 <sub>2</sub> peptide. The concentrations of 1-aminocyclohexane derivative (e.g., memantine or neramexane) resulting in therapeutically meaningful decrease in the processing and/or secretion of the amyloidogenic A\u03b2 in cell cultures are further tested in vivo by monitoring of A\u03b2 levels in transgenic animal models of AD, such as the mouse animal models expressing APP minigenes that encode FAD-linked APP mutants (e.g., swe or 717, as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. \n\n5,912,410) or the double mutant mouse model descibed by Borchelt et al. (Neuron, 19: 939-945, 1997). The latter transgenic mice coexpress an early-onset familial AD (FAD)-linked human presenilin 1 (PS1) variant (A246E) and a chimeric mouse/human APP harboring mutations linked to Swedish FAD kindreds (APPswe). These mice d"
