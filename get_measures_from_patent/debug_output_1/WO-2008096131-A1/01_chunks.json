    "no-precipitation, affinity chromatography, or cell based assays.</p>\n  The amount of binding of antibody molecule to PcnPS may be determined. Quantitation may be related to the amount of the antigen in a test sample, which may be of diagnostic interest.</p>\n  A kit comprising an antibody molecule according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention is also provided as an aspect of the present invention. In a kit of the invention, the antibody molecule may be labelled to allow its reactivity in a sample to be determined, e.g. as described further below. Components of a kit are generally sterile and in sealed vials or other containers. Kits may be employed in diagnostic analysis or other methods for which antibody molecules are useful. A kit may contain instructions for use of the components in a method, e.g. a method in accordance with \n\n the present invention. Ancillary materials to assist in or to enable performing such a method may be included within a kit of the invention.</p>\n  The reactivities of antibodies in a sample may be determined by any appropriate means. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is one possibility. Radioactive labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the antibody. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the antibody determined. The more antigen there is in the test sample the less radioactive antigen will bind to the antibody. A competitive binding assay may also be used with non-radioactive antigen, using antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor or laser dye with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine .</p>\n  Other reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes, which catalyse reactions that develop, or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed. \n\n The signals generated by individual antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant antibody binding in samples (normal and test) .</p>\n  Various further aspects and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view o"
