    "LLVY-AMC (0.1 mM) in the presence or absence of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10\u03bcM) (Fenteany, G. et al. Lactacystin, proteasome function and cell fate. J. Biol. Chem., 273: 8545-8548, 1998). Only lactacystin suppressible activity was considered to be proteasome specific. Activity was adjusted for the protein concentration of the sample, determined using the Bradford assay (Sigma Chemical Co., Dorset, United Kingdom) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For Western blot analysis, cytosolic protein (2 to 5\u03bcg) obtained for the above assay were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45\u03bcm nitrocellulose membrane, which had been blocked with 5% Marvel in PBS, at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 :100 (anti-actin and PKC<sub>\u03b1</sub>); 1 :500 (anti-ERK1 and 2); 1 :1000 (anti-20S proteasome \u03b2-subunit and I-\u03baB ); 1 :1500 (anti-20S proteasome \u03b1-subunit) or 1 :5000 (anti-p42), while the secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 :2000. Incubation was carried out for 2h at room temperature and development was by ECL. Loading was quantitated by actin concentration. DNA binding proteins were extracted from myotubes by the method of Andrews, N.C. et al. A rapid micropreparation technique for extraction of DNA-binding proteins from limiting numbers of mammalian cells. Nucleic Acids Res., 19: 2499, 1991 , which utilizes hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei. The EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) binding assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Since protein degradation and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway in mice bearing the MAC16 tumor is thought to be mediated by PIF, mechanistic studies on the effect of HMB on protein degradation were carried out in murine myotubes treated with PIF. PIF-induced total protein breakdown with a typical bell-shaped dose- response curve, as previously reported by Gomes-Marcondes, et al Development of an in- vitro model system to investigate the mechanism of muscle protein catabolism induced by proteolysis-inducing factor. Br. J. Cancer, 86: 1628-1633, 2002 with a maximal effect at 4nM. The effect of EPA has been previously shown (Smith, H.J. et al.

Increased expression of the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway in murine myotubes by proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) is associated with activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Br. J.

The flavor solution is then added to the blended slurry with agitation. If necessary, diluted potassium hydroxide is added to the blended slurry such that the product will have a pH in the range of 6.4 to 7.0 after sterilization. The completed product is then placed in suitable containers and subjected to sterilization. Of course, if desired aseptic processing could be employed.</p>Example VI Composition of a Nutritional Product to Control Glvcemic Response Table 2 presents a bill of materials for manufacturing 1 ,000 kg of a liquid nutritional product, which provides nutrients to a person but limits resulting insulin response.

A carbohydrate/mineral slurry is prepared by first heating about 82 kg of water to a temperature of from about 65\u00b0C to about 71 \u00b0C with agitation. With agitation, the required mount of calcium HMB is added and agitated for 5 minutes. The required amount of sodium citrate and gellen gum distributed by the Kelco, Division of Merck and Company Incorporated, San Diego, California, U.S.A. is added and agitated for 5 minutes. The required amount of the ultra trace mineral/trace mineral (UTM/TM) premix (distributed by Fortitech, Schnectady, New York) is added. The slurry is greenish yellow in color. Agitation is maintained until the minerals are completely dispersed. With agitation, the required amounts of the following minerals are then added: potassium citrate, potassium chloride, chromium chloride, magnesium chloride and potassium iodide. Next, the first maltodextrin distributed by Grain Processing Corporation, Muscataine, Iowa, U.S.A. and fructose are added to slurry under high agitation, and are allowed to dissolve. With agitation, the required amounts of maltitol powder distributed by Roquette America, Inc., Keokuk, Iowa, maltito"
