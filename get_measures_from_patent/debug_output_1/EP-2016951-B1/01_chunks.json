    "lypeptide. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described, for example, in Deutscher, Methods in Enzymology, 182 (1990); Scopes, Protein Purification:Principles and Practice, Springer-Verlag, New York (1982). The purification step(s) selected will depend, for example, on the nature of the production process used and the particular VEGF-E polypeptide produced.</p>Since VEGF-E may aggregate into dimers, it is within the scope hereof to provide hetero- and homodimers. Where one or more subunits are variants, the changes in amino acid sequence can be the same or different for each subunit chain. Heterodimers are readily produced by cotransforming host cells with DNA encoding both subunits and, if necessary, purifying the desired heterodimer, or by separately synthesizing the subunits, dissociating the subunits (e.g., by treatment with a chaotropic agent such as urea, guanidine hydrochloride, or the like), mixing the dissociated subunits, and then reassociating the subunits by dialyzing away the chaotropic agent.</p>E. Uses for VEGF-E and Formulations1. Assays for Cardiovascular, Endothelial, andAngiogenic ActivityVarious assays can be used to test the polypeptide herein for cardiovascular, endothelial, and angiogenic activity. Such assays include those provided in the Examples below.</p>Assays for testing for endothelin antagonist activity, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,414</patcit>, include a rat heart ventricle binding assay where the polypeptide is tested for its ability to inhibit iodinized endothelin-1 binding in a receptor assay, an endothelin receptor binding assay testing for intact cell binding of radiolabeled endothelin-1 using rabbit renal artery vascular smooth muscle cells, an inositol phosphate accumulation assay where functional activity is determined in Rat-1 cells by measuring intracellular levels of second messengers, an arachidonic acid release assay that measures the ability of added compounds to reduce endothelin-stimulated arachidonic acid release in cultured vascular smooth muscles, in vitro (isolated vessel) studies using endothelium from male New Zealand rabbits, and in vivo studies using male Sprague-Dawley rats. Assays for tissue generation activity include, without limitation, those described in WO 95/16035</patcit> (bone, cartilage, tendon); WO 95/05846</patcit> (nerve, neuronal), and WO 91/07491</patcit> (skin, endothelium).</p>Assays for wound-healing activity include, for example, those described in Winter, Epidermal Wound Healing, Maibach, HI and Rovee, DT, eds. (Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc., Chicago), pp. 71-112, as modified by the article of Eaglstein and Mertz, J. Invest. Dermatol., 71: 382-384 (1978).</p>An assay to screen for a test molecule relating to a VEGF-E polypeptide that binds an endothelin B<sub>1</sub> (ETB<sub>1</sub>) receptor polypeptide and modulates signal transduction activity involves providing a host cell transformed with a DNA encoding endothelin B<sub>1</sub> receptor polypeptide, exposing the cells to the test candidate, and measuring endothelin B<sub>1</sub> recept",
    "in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against a VEGF-E polypeptide. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567</patcit>. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed "
