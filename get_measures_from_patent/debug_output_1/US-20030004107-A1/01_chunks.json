It is one of the most prevalent illnesses in the elderly population, and with the aging of society, will become even more significant. Costs associated with AD include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct non-medical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost patient and care giver productivity. Medical treatment and behavior modification may have economic benefits by slowing the rate of cognitive decline, delaying institutionalization, reducing care giver hours, and improving quality of life. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown positive results regarding the effect of drug therapy and behavior modification on nursing home placement, cognition, and care giver time. </p>[0008] Neural thread proteins (NTP) are a family of recently characterized brain proteins. One member of this family, AD7C-NTP, is a \u02dc41 kD membrane associated phosphoprotein with functions related to neuritic sprouting (de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997); de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999); de la Monte SM and Wands JR, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 3:345-353 (2001)). The gene that encodes AD7C-NTP and predicted protein sequence for AD7C-NTP has been identified and described (de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997)). In addition to the \u02dc41 kD species, other species of neural thread protein (\u02dc26 kD, \u02dc21 kD, \u02dc17 kD, and \u02dc15 kD) have been identified and associated with neuroectodermal tumors, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas and with injury due to hypoxia, schema, or cerebral infarction (Xu et al., Cancer Research, 53:3823-3829 (1993); de la Monte et al., J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., 55(10):1038-50 (1996), de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 138(1-2):26-35 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 135(2):118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)). </p>[0009] Species of neural thread protein have been described and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634; 5,948,888; and 5,830,670, all for \u201cNeural Thread Protein Gene Expression and Detection of Alzheimer's Disease\u201d and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,705 for \u201cMethod of Detecting Neurological Disease or Dysfunction.\u201d The disclosures of these patents are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As described therein, NTP is upregulated and produced during cell death. Thus, dead and dying nerve cells are described as overproducing NTP, and accordingly, its presence indicates the death of nerve cells and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). </p>[0010] Other species of neural thread protein have been identified as other products of the AD7c-NTP gene (e.g. a 112 amino acid protein described in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession #XP<sub>\u2014</sub>032307 PID g15928971) or as being similar to neural thread proteins (e.g. a 106 amino acid protein described i",
