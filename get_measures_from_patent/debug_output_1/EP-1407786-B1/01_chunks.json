    "mal tissues. Exemplary of such therapeutic agents are those capable of reducing or eliminating hyperactivity of corneal epithelium and stroma, pathological proliferation or prolonged contraction of smooth muscle cells or pericytes of the intraocular vasculature implicated in degenerative eye disease resulting from hyperplasia or decreased vascular lumen area. Preferred agents for this purpose are staurosporin and cytochalasin B.</p>Vascular smooth muscle binding proteins of the invention bind to targets on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells. It will be recognized that specific targets, e.g., polypeptides or carbohydrates, proteoglycans and the like, that are associated with the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells are useful for selecting (e.g., by cloning) or constructing (e.g., by genetic engineering or chemical synthesis) appropriately specific vascular smooth muscle binding proteins. Particularly useful \"targets\" are internalized by smooth muscle cells, e.g., as membrane constituent antigen turnover occurs in renewal. Internalization by cells may also be by mechanisms involving phagolysosomes, clathrin-coated pits, receptor-mediated redistribution or endocytosis and the like. In a preferred embodiment, such a \"target\" is exemplified by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and a discrete portion (termed an epitope herein) of the CSPG molecule having an apparent molecular weight of about 250 kD is especially preferred. The 250 kD target is an N-linked glycoprotein that is a component of a larger 400 kD proteoglycan complex (14). In one presently preferred embodiment of the invention, a vascular smooth muscle binding protein is provided by NR-AN-01 monoclonal antibody (a subculture of NR-ML-05) that binds to an epitope in a vascular smooth muscle CSPG target molecule. The monoclonal antibody designated NR-ML-05 reportedly binds a 250 kD CSPG synthesized by melanoma cells (Morgan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,255). Smooth muscle cells and pericytes also reportedly synthesize a 250 kD CSPG as well as other CSPGs (11). NR-ML-05 binding to smooth muscle cells has been disclosed (Fritzberg et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,225). Monoclonal antibody NR-ML-05 and subculture NR-ML-05 No. 85-41-41-A2, freeze # A2106, have both been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD and granted Accession Nos. HB-5350 and HB-9350, respectively. NR-ML-05 is the parent of, and structurally and functionally equivalent to, subclone NR-AN-01, disclosed herein. It will be recognized that NR-AN-01 is just one example of a vascular smooth muscle binding protein that specifically associates with the 400 kD CSPG target, and that other binding proteins associating with this target and other epitopes in this target (14) are also useful in the therapeutic conjugates and methods of the invention. In the present case, six other murine monoclonal antibodies and two human chimeric monoclonal antibodies have also been selected, as described herein, that specifically target to the 250 kD CSPG of vascular smooth muscle cells. The antibodies also appear to be internalized by the smooth muscle cells following binding to the cell membrane. Immunoreactivity studies have also shown the binding of the murine MAbs to the 250 kD antigen in 45 human normal tissues and 30 different neoplasms and some of these results have been disclosed previously (U.S. Patent No. 4,879,225). In this disclosure and other human clinical studies, MAbs directed to the CSPG 250 kD antigen localized to vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo. Further, it will be recognized that the amino acid residues involved in the multi-point kinetic association of the NR-AN-01 monoclonal antibody with a CSPG marker antigenic epitope (i.e., the amino acids constituting the complementarity determining regions) are determined by computer-assisted molecular modeling and by the use of mutants having altered antibody binding affinity. The binding-site amino acids and three dimensional model of the NR-AN-01 antigen binding site serve as a molecular model for constructing functional equivalents, e.g., short polypeptides (\"minimal polypeptides\"); that have binding affinity for a CSPG synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes.</p>In a presently preferred embodiment for treating stenosis following vascular surgical procedures, e.g., PTCA, selected binding proteins, e.g., antibodies or fragments, for use in the practice of the invention have a binding affinity of &gt;10<sup>4</sup> liter/mole for the vascular smooth muscle 250 kD CSPG, and also the ability to be bound to and internalized by smooth muscle cells or</p>Three-dimensional modeling is also useful to construct other functional equivalents that mimic the binding of NR-AN-01 to its antigenic epitope, e.g., \"mimetic\" chemical compounds that mimic the three-dimensional aspects of NR-AN-01 binding to its epitope in a CSPG target antigen. As used herein, \"minimal polypeptide\" refers to an amino acid sequence of at least six amino acids in length. As used herein, the term \"mimetic\" refers to an organic chemical polymer constructed to achieve the proper spacing for binding to the amino acids of, for example, an NR-AN-01 CSPG target synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes.</p>It will be recognized that the inventors also contemplate the utility of human monoclonal antibodies or \"humanized\" murine antibody as a vascular smooth muscle binding protein in the therapeutic conjugates of their invention. For example, murine monoclonal antibody may be \"chimerized\" by genetically recombining the nucleotide sequence encoding the murine Fv region (i.e., containing the antigen binding sites) with the nucleotide sequence encoding a human constant domain region and an Fc region e.g., in a manner similar to that disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0,411,893 A2. Humanized vascular smooth muscle binding partners will be recognized to have the advantage of decreasing the immunoreactivity of the antibody or polypeptide in the host recipient",

The filtrate was then assayed for Roridin A on C-18 reverse phase HPLC using a mobile phase of 50:48:2 ratio CH<sub>3</sub>CN:H<sub>2</sub>O:HOAC, respectively.

Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the binding kinetics of a smooth muscle binding protein with a Ka of &gt;10<sup>9</sup> liter/mole. Because human vascular smooth muscle cells grow slowly in culture, and baboon smooth muscle cells were found to express the human CSPG cell surface marker, BO54 baboon artery smooth muscle cells and human A375 M/M (melanoma; ATCC #CRL1619) cells bearing CSPG surface marker were used in many of the studies described in the Examples, below.</p>For the kinetic binding studies, A375 M/M and BO54 cells were seeded in sterile 96 well microtiter plates at 2500 cells/well.
