{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nCompounds with Ki's below 1\u00b5M are designated A. \nIn a 15 minute incubation period, the S isomer exhibited a Ki in category A and the R isomer exhibited a Ki in category B. \nThe steady-state inhibition constant, Ki*, of several compounds of formula I was determined in an assay that was modified slightly from a fluorescence peptide cleavage assay described in Taliani, M., E. Bianchi, F. Narjes, M. Fossatelli, A. Rubani, C. Steinkuhler, R. De Francesco, and A. Pessi. 1996. \nKi* of the compounds was determined by fitting activity vs. inhibitor concentration data to the Morrison equation for tight-binding enzyme inhibition. \nThe dissociation rate constant of the complex between HCV NS3 protease and compounds was determined using the RET-S1 substrate as follows. \nA1 \u00b5L aliquot of 100 \u00b5M of a compound of formula I with 50% or less R isomer dissolved in 100% DMSO was added to a 49 \u00b5L aliquot of the pre-warmed enzyme stock to yield a mixture of 320 nM enzyme and 2 \u00b5M of the compound, which was then incubated at 30\u00b0 C for 4 h to allow formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex to reach equilibrium. \nFinal concentrations were 0.5 nM HCV NS3 protease, 25 \u00b5M KK4A peptide, 12 \u00b5M RET-S1, and 3 nM (1S,3aR,6aS)-2-[(2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-cyclohexyl-1-oxo-2- [(pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]ethyl]amino]-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl]-N-[(1R)-1-[2-(cyclopropylamino)-1,2-dioxoethyl]butyl]octahyd \n\nNote that some of these sentences may not contain all the required information (e.g., specific molecule name, bioactivity metric, numeric value, and unit), but they are the closest matches to the criteria.
