COMPOUNDS</p>Compounds of the present invention provide desirable therapeutic treatments because they were observed to have a greater bioavailability when the R isomer at position C* was greater than 50% of the mixture (e.g., about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 98%). Unexpectedly, the R isomer at the C* position is about 2 times more bioavailable than the S isomer at the C* position. Additionally, the R isomer at C* position converts in vivo, to the S isomer at C* position at a higher percentage than the S at the C* position. These properties enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of compounds of formula I with greater than 50% R isomer at position C* as inhibitors of serine protease activity, such as inhibiting the activity of hepatitis C virus NS3-NS4A protease. For instance, some embodiments of the present invention that were greater than 50% R isomer at C* had measured Ki(app)'s of less than 3 \u00b5M (e.g., about 2 \u00b5M, about 1.5 \u00b5M , or about 1.190 \u00b5M), IC<sub>50</sub>'S of less than about 0.9 \u00b5M (e.g., about 0.883 \u00b5M), and a CC<sub>50</sub> of greater than 100 \u00b5M.</p>The high bioavailability and the favorable isomer conversion properties at position C* deliver enhanced therapeutic effectiveness in compounds of the present invention, such as (1S,3aR,6aS)-2-[(2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-cyclohexyl-1-oxo-2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]ethyl]amino]-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl]-N-[(1R)-1-[2-(cyclopropylamino)-1,2-dioxoethyl]butyl]octahydro-cyclopenta[c]pyrrole-1-carboxamide, as compared to compounds of 50% or greater S isomer at position C*.</p>The present invention provides a compound of formula I\n<img id=\"ib0002\" path=\"imgb0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/166885867/EP/20120104/A1/000002/40/23/31/imgb0002.tif\"/>\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or mixtures thereof, wherein</p>C* represents a diasteromeric carbon atom; and the R isomer is greater than 50% of the mixture relative to the S isomer at the C* position.</p>R<sub>1</sub> is RW-, P<sub>3</sub>-, or P<sub>4</sub>-L<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-.</p>R is an optionally substituted aliphatic, an optionally substituted cycloaliphatic, an optionally substituted heterocycloaliphatic, an optionally substituted aryl, or an optionally substituted heteroaryl.</p>W is a bond, -NR<sub>4</sub>-, -O-, or -S-.</p>R<sub>4</sub> is H, an optionally substituted aliphatic, an optionally substituted ",

FORMULATIONS, USES, AND ADMINISTRATIONS</p>Compounds of the present invention can be desirable therapeutic agents because they were observed to have a greater bioavailability when the R isomer at position C* was greater than 50% of the mixture (e.g., about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 99%). Mixtures with greater than 50% R isomer at the C* position were about 2 times more bioavailable than the S isomer at the C* position. Specifically, the total bioavailability was about 98% for the orally dosed R isomer at C* and 50% for the orally dosed S isomer at C*, when represented by the combined exposure of the 2 isomers. Furthermore, following oral dosing, the R isomer at C* to S isomer at C* conversion was more prominent than the S isomer at C* to R isomer at C* conversion. Interconversion occurred to a larger extent after an oral dose when compared with that after an IV dose.</p>Compounds of the present invention can be useful therapeutic treatments for HCV infection because these compounds inhibit serine protease activity, particularly the activity of hepatitis C virus NS3-NS4A protease. Some embodiments of the present invention that were greater than 50% R isomer at C* had measured Ki(app)'s of less than 3 \u00b5M (e.g., about 2 \u00b5M, about 1.5 \u00b5M, or about 1.190 \u00b5M), IC50's of less than about 0.9 \u00b5M (e.g., about 0.883 \u00b5M), and a CC50 of greater than 100 \u00b5M.</p>The invention includes a methods of administering mixtures of compounds of formula (I) for treating HCV in which the mixture contains greater than 50% of the R isomer at C* position.</p>One embodiment of this invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or mixtures of salts thereof. According to another embodiment, the compound of formula I is present in an amount effective to decrease the viral load in a sample or in a patient, wherein said virus encodes a serine protease necessary for the viral life cycle, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>If pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention are utilized in these compositions, those salts are preferably derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases.

In one embodiment, any additional agent is administered as part of a single dosage form with the protease inhibitor or as a separate dosage form. As this invention involves a combination of compounds, the specific amounts of each compound may be dependent on the specific amounts of each other compound in the combination. As recognized by skilled practitioners, dosages of interferon are typically measured in IU (e.g., about 4 million IU to about 12 million IU).</p>Accordingly, agents (whether acting as an immunomodulatory agent or otherwise) that may be used in combination with a compound of this invention include, but are not limited to, Albuferon\u2122 (albumin-Interferon alpha) available from Human Genome Sciences; interferon-alpha 2B (INTRON-A\u00ae, Schering Plough); REBETRON\u00ae (Schering Plough, Inteferon-alpha 2B + Ribavirin); pegylated interferon alpha (Reddy, K.R. et al. \"Efficacy and Safety of Pegylated (40-kd) interferon alpha-2a compared with interferon alpha-2a in noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C (Hepatology, 33, pp. 433-438 (2001); consensus interferon (Kao, J.H., et al., \"Efficacy of Consensus Interferon in the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis\" J.

Biochem. 240:60-67; hereby incorporated by reference.</p>The assay was performed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (Buffer A), using the RET-S1 fluorescent peptide as substrate. Reactions were continuously monitored using an fMax fluorescence microtitre plate reader (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA) thermostatted at 30\u00b0 C, with excitation and emission filters of 355 nm and 495 nm, respectively. A stock solution of HCV NS3 protease in Buffer A containing 25 \u00b5M KK4A peptide was pre-incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by an additional 10 min incubation at 30\u00b0 C. An aliquot of a compound of formula I with 50% or less R isomer, dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was added to a solution of RET-S1 in Buffer A containing 25 \u00b5M KK4A peptide and pre-incubated at 30\u00b0 C for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an aliquot of the NS3 protease/KK4A stock to the compound/RET-S1/KK4A/Buffer A mixture to yield final concentrations of 12 \u00b5M RET-S1, 2% (v/v) DMSO, 25 \u00b5M KK4A peptide, and 0.5-1.0 nM HCV NS3 protease. Steady-state reaction rates were determined from linear regression of the fluorescence vs. time data points obtained over a 5-min window at a reaction time of 4 h. Ki* of the compounds was determined by fitting activity vs. inhibitor concentration data to the Morrison equation for tight-binding enzyme inhibition. See Morrison, J. F. 1969.

A stock solution of HCV NS3 protease in Buffer A containing 25 \u00b5M KK4A peptide was prepared as described above. A1 \u00b5L aliquot of 100 \u00b5M of a compound of formula I with 50% or less R isomer dissolved in 100% DMSO was added to a 49 \u00b5L aliquot of the pre-warmed enzyme stock to yield a mixture of 320 nM enzyme and 2 \u00b5M of the compound, which was then incubated at 30\u00b0 C for 4 h to allow formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex to reach equilibrium.
