    "nt is placed. The amount of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist is released into the eye for a period of time greater than about one week after the implant is placed in the eye and is effective in preventing, reducing or treating an ocular disease or condition such as glaucoma, neurodegeneration, a retinal disorder or condition or an ocular vasculopathy, such as vascular occlusion.</p>In one embodiment, the intraocular implants comprise an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a biodegradable polymer matrix. The alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist is associated with a biodegradable polymer matrix that degrades at a rate effective to sustain release of an amount of the agonist from the implant for a time sufficient to reduce or prevent an ocular vascular occlusion. The intraocular implant is biodegradable or bioerodible and provides a sustained release of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist in an eye for extended periods of time, such as for more than one week, for example for about three months or more and up to about six months or more. In certain implants, the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist is released for about 30-35 days or less. In other implants, the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist is released for 40 days or more.</p>The biodegradable polymer component of the foregoing implants may be a mixture of biodegradable polymers, wherein at least one of the biodegradable polymers is a polylactic acid polymer having a molecular weight less than 64 kiloDaltons (kD). Additionally or alternatively, the foregoing implants may comprise a first biodegradable polymer of a polylactic acid, and a different second biodegradable polymer of a polylactic acid. Furthermore, the foregoing implants may comprise a mixture of different biodegradable polymers, each biodegradable polymer having an inherent viscosity in a range from about 0.2 (or about 0.3) deciliters/gram (dl/g) to about 1.0 dl/g.</p>The alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist of the implants disclosed herein may include quinoxaline derivatives, or other agonists that are effective in treating ocular conditions. One example of a suitable quinoxaline derivative is brimonidine or brimonidine tartrate. In addition, the therapeutic component of the present implants may include one or more additional and different therapeutic agents that may be effective in treating an ocular condition.</p>A method of making the present implants involves combining or mixing the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a biodegradable polymer or polymers.</p>The mixture may then be extruded or compressed to form a single composition. The single composition may then be processed to form individual implants suitable for placement in an eye of a patient.</p>The implants may be placed in an ocular region to treat a variety of ocular conditions, including conditions such as ocular vasculopathies that affect an anterior region or posterior region of an eye. For example, the implants may be used to treat many conditio",
    "ials may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked, for example not more than lightly cross-linked, such as less than about 5%, or less than about 1% of the polymeric material being cross-linked. For the most part, besides carbon and hydrogen, the polymers will include at least one of oxygen and nitrogen, advantageously oxygen. The oxygen may be present as oxy, e.g. hydroxy or ether, carbonyl, e.g. non-oxo-carbonyl, such as carboxylic acid ester, and the like. The nitrogen may be present as amide, cyano and amino. The polymers set forth in Heller, Biodegradable Polymers in Controlled Drug Delivery, In: CRC Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, Vol. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. 1987, pp 39-90, which describes encapsulation for controlled drug delivery, may find use in the present implants.</p>Of additional interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homopolymers or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Polyesters of interest include polymers of D-lactic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. Generally, by employing the L-lactate or D-lactate, a slowly eroding polymer or polymeric material is achieved, while erosion is substantially enhanced with the lactate racemate.</p>Among the useful polysaccharides are, without limitation, calcium alginate, and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters characterized by being water insoluble, a molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, for example.</p>Other polymers of interest include, without limitation, polyvinyl alcohol, polyesters, polyethers and combinations thereof which are biocompatible and may be biodegradable and/or bioerodible.</p>Some preferred characteristics of the polymers or polymeric materials for use in the present invention may include biocompatibility, compatibility with the therapeutic component, ease of use of the polymer in making the drug delivery systems of the present invention, a half-life in the physiological environment of at least about 6 hours, preferably greater than about one day, not significantly increasing the viscosity of the vitreous, and water insolubility.</p>The biodegradable polymeric materials which are included to form the matrix are desirably subject to enzymatic or hydrolytic instability. Water soluble polymers may be cross-linked with hydrolytic or biodegradable unstable cross-links to provide useful water insoluble polymers. The degree of stability can be varied widely, depending upon the choice of monomer, whether a homopolymer or copolymer is employed, employing mixtures of polymers, and whether the polymer includes terminal acid groups.</p>Equally important to controlling the biodegradation of the polymer and hence the extended release profile of the implant is the relative average molecular weight of the polymeric composition employed in the implant. Different molecular weights of the same or different polymeric compositions may be included in the implant to modulate the release profile. In certain implants, the relative average molecular weight of the polymer will range from about 9 to about 64 kD, usually from about 10 to about 54 kD, and more usually from about 12 to about 45 kD.</p>In some implants, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid are used, where the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid. The most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of glycolic acid and lactic acid. Homopolymers, or copolymers having ratios other than equal, are more resistant to degradation. The ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid will also affect the brittleness of the implant, where a more flexible implant is desirable for larger geometries. The % of polylactic acid in the polylactic acid polyglycolic acid (PLGA) copolymer can be 0-100%, preferably about 15-85%, more preferably about 35-65%. In some implants, a 50/50 PLGA copolymer is used.</p>The biodegradable polymer matrix of the intraocular implant may comprise a mixture of two or more biodegradable polymers. For example, the implant may comprise a mixture of a first biodegradable polymer and a different second biodegradable polymer. One or more of the biodegradable polymers may have terminal acid groups.</p>Release of a drug from an erodible polymer is the consequence of several mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms include desorption from the implants surface, dissolution, diffusion through porous channels of the hydrated polymer and erosion. Erosion can be bulk or surface or combination of both. As discussed herein, the matrix of the intraocular implant may release drug at a rate effective to sustain release of an amount of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist for more than one week after implantation into an eye. In certain implants, therapeutic amounts of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist are released for no more than about 30-35 days after implantation. For example, an implant may comprise brimonidine tartrate, and the matrix of the implant degrades at a rate effective to sustain release of a therapeutically effective amount of brimonidine tartrate for about one month after being placed in an eye. As another example, the implant may comprise brimonidine tartrate, and the matrix releases drug at a rate effective to sustain release of a therapeutically effective amount of brimonidine tartrate for more than forty days, such as for about six months.</p>One example of the biodegradable intraocular implant comprises an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist associated with a biodegradable polymer matrix, which comprises a mixture of different biodegradable polymers. At least one of the biodegradable polymers can be polylactide having a molecular weight from about 40 to about 80 kD. A second biodegradable polymer can be a polylactide having a molecular weight of from about 10 to 20 kD. Such a mixture is effective in sustaining release of a therapeutically effective amount of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist for a time period greater than about one month from the time the implant is placed in an eye.</p>Another example of a biodegradable intraocular implant comprises an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist associated with a biodegradable polymer matrix, which comprises a mixture of different biodegradable polymers, each biodegradable polymer having an inherent viscosity from about 0.16 dl/g to about 1.0 dl/g. For example, one of the biodegradable polymers may have an inherent viscosity of about 0.3 dl/g. A second biodegradable polymer may have an inherent viscosity of about 1.0 dl/g. The inherent viscosities identified above may be determined in 0.1% chloroform at 25\u00b0 C.</p>One particular implant comprises brimonidine tartrate associated with a combination of two different polylactide polymers. The brimonidine tartrate can present at up to about 60% by weight of the implant. One polylactide polymer can have a molecular weight of about 14 kD and an inherent viscosity of about 0.3 dl/g, and the other polylactide polymer can have a molecular weight of about 63.3 kD and an inherent viscosity of about 1.0 dl/g. The two polylactide polymers can be present in the implant in a 1:1 ratio. Such an implant provides for release of the brimonidine for more than two months in vitro, as described herein. The implant is provided in the form of a rod, bar or disc or a filament produced by an extrusion or injection molding process.</p>The release of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist from the intraocular implant comprising a biodegradable polymer matrix may include an initial burst of release followed by a gradual increase in the amount of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist released, or the release may include an initial delay in release of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist followed by an increase in release. When the implant is substantially completely degraded, the percent of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that has been released is about one hundred.</p>Compared to existing implants, the implants disclosed herein do not completely release, or release about 100% of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, until after about one week of being placed in an eye.</p>It may be desirable to provide a relatively constant rate of release of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist from the implant over the life of the implant. For example, it may be desirable for the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist to be released in amounts from about 0.01 pg to about 2 pg per day for the life of the implant. However, the release rate may change"
