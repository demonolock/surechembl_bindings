{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe % of polylactic acid in the polylactic acid polyglycolic acid (PLGA) copolymer can be 0-100%, preferably about 15-85%, more preferably about 35-65%. \nOne particular implant comprises brimonidine tartrate associated with a combination of two different polylactide polymers, where one polylactide polymer can have a molecular weight of about 14 kD and an inherent viscosity of about 0.3 dl/g, and the other polylactide polymer can have a molecular weight of about 63.3 kD and an inherent viscosity of about 1.0 dl/g. \nA second biodegradable polymer can be a polylactide having a molecular weight of from about 10 to 20 kD. \nAt least one of the biodegradable polymers can be polylactide having a molecular weight from about 40 to about 80 kD. \nOne of the biodegradable polymers may have an inherent viscosity of about 0.3 dl/g, and a second biodegradable polymer may have an inherent viscosity of about 1.0 dl/g. \nThe inherent viscosities identified above may be determined in 0.1% chloroform at 25\u00b0 C, with inherent viscosities from about 0.16 dl/g to about 1.0 dl/g. \nThe relative average molecular weight of the polymer will range from about 9 to about 64 kD, usually from about 10 to about 54 kD, and more usually from about 12 to about 45 kD. \nThe molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, for example, characterizes carboxymethylcellulose esters."}
