    "rse Hoogsteen binding.</p>a. Triplex-forming Oligonucleotides (TFOs)</p>Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are defined as oligonucleotides which bind as third strands to duplex DNA in a sequence specific manner The oligonucleotides are synthetic or isolated nucleic acid molecules which selectively bind to or hybridize with a predetermined target sequence, target region, or target site within or adjacent to a human gene so as to form a triple-stranded structure.</p>Preferably, the oligonucleotide is a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule between 7 and 40 nucleotides in length, most preferably 10 to 20 nucleotides in length for in vitro mutagenesis and 20 to 30 nucleotides in length for in vivo mutagenesis. The nucleobase (sometimes referred to herein simply as \u201cbase\u201d) composition may be homopurine or homopyrimidine. Alternatively, the nucleobase composition may be polypurine or polypyrimidine. However, other compositions are also useful.</p>The oligonucleotides are preferably generated using known DNA synthesis procedures. In one embodiment, oligonucleotides are generated synthetically. Oligonucleotides can also be chemically modified using standard methods that are well known in the art.</p>The nucleobase sequence of the oligonucleotides/oligomer is selected based on the sequence of the target sequence, the physical constraints imposed by the need to achieve binding of the oligonucleotide/oligomer within the major groove of the target region, and the need to have a low dissociation constant (Ka) for the oligo/target sequence complex. The oligonucleotides/oligomers have a nucleobase composition which is conducive to triple-helix formation and is generated based on one of the known structural motifs for third strand binding (e.g. Hoogsteen binding). The most stable complexes are formed on polypurine:polypyrimidine elements, which are relatively abundant in mammalian genomes. Triplex formation by TFOs can occur with the third strand oriented either parallel or anti-parallel to the purine strand of the nucleic acid duplex. In the anti-parallel, purine motif, the triplets are G.G:C and A.A:T, whereas in the parallel pyrimidine motif, the canonical triplets are C<sup>+</sup>.G:C and T.A:T. The triplex structures can be stabilized by one, two or three Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (depending on the nucleobase) between the bases in the TFO strand and the purine strand in the duplex. A review of base compositions and binding properties for third strand binding oligonucleotides and/or peptide nucleic acids is provided in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,251, Bentin et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 34(20): 5790-5799 (2006), and Hansen et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 37(13): 4498-4507 (2009).</p>Preferably, the oligonucleotide/oligomer binds to or hybridizes to the target sequence under conditions of high stringency and specificity. Most preferably, the oligonucleotides/oligomers bind in a sequence-specific manner within the major groove of duplex DNA. Reaction conditi",
    " one gamma modification is a side chain of an amino acid selected from the group consisting of alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, lysine, arginine, and the derivatives thereof. In some embodiments, all gamma modifications are gamma miniPEG modifications. Optionally, at least one PNA segment comprises a G-clamp (9-(2-guanidinoethoxy) phenoxazine).</p>2. Triplex-Forming Target Sequence Considerations</p>The triplex-forming molecules bind to a predetermined target region referred to herein as the \u201ctarget sequence,\u201d \u201ctarget region,\u201d or \u201ctarget site.\u201d The target sequence for the triplex-forming molecules can be within or adjacent to a human gene encoding, for example the beta globin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or other gene discussed in more detail below, or an enzyme necessary for the metabolism of lipids, glycoproteins, or mucopolysaccharides, or another gene in need of correction. The target sequence can be within the coding DNA sequence of the gene or within an intron. The target sequence can also be within DNA sequences which regulate expression of the target gene, including promoter or enhancer sequences or sites that regulate RNA splicing.</p>The nucleotide sequences of the triplex-forming molecules are selected based on the sequence of the target sequence, the physical constraints, and the preference for a low dissociation constant (Ka) for the triplex-forming molecules/target sequence. As used herein, triplex-forming molecules are said to be substantially complementary to a target region when the triplex-forming molecules has a nucleobase composition which allows for the formation of a triple-helix with the target region. A triplex-forming molecule can be substantially complementary to a target region even when there are non-complementary nucleobases present in the triplex-forming molecules.</p>There are a variety of structural motifs available which can be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of a substantially complementary oligonucleotide. Preferably, the triplex-forming molecules bind to or hybridize to the target sequence under conditions of high stringency and specificity. Reaction conditions for in vitro triple helix formation of an triplex-forming molecules probe or primer to a nucleic acid sequence vary from triplex-forming molecules to triplex-forming molecules, depending on factors such as the length triplex-forming molecules, the number of G:C and A:T base pairs, and the composition of the buffer utilized in the hybridization reaction.</p>a. Target Sequence Considerations for TFOs</p>Preferably, the TFO is a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule between 7 and 40 nucleotides in length, most preferably 10 to 20 nucleotides in length for in vitro mutagenesis and 20 to 30 nucleotides in length for in vivo mutagenesis. The base composition may be homopurine or homopyri"
