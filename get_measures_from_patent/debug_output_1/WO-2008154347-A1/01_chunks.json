After 16 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered through filter agent and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified on reverse- phase HPLC C18 column eluting with acetonitrile/water/thfluoroacetic acid to give the title Compound 8 (74 mg, 41 %) as a white powder: <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CD<sub>3</sub>OD) \u03b4 8.05-7.92 (m, 2H), 7.64 (m, 1 H), 7.38-7.07 (m, 4H), 6.87-6.76 (m, 4H), 3.71 (s, 3H), 3.47-1.34 (m, 13H); MS (ESI) m/z 522 (MH)<sup>+</sup>.</p>\n  Using the procedure of Example 13, other compounds representative of the present invention were prepared:</p>\n  Cpd Name and Data</p>\n  9 N-[3-methoxy-4-(2-chloro-5-fluoro-phenylcarbonyl)amino-phenylcarbonyl]-</p>\n  2-hydroxyimino-spiro[cyclopentane-1 ,4'-benzo[b]azepane]</p>\n  <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CD<sub>3</sub>OD) \u03b4 8.03 (m, 1 H), 7.64 (m, 1 H), 7.36-7.06 (m, 5H), 6.87- 6.77 (m, 3H), 3.71 (s, 3H), 3.47-1.34 (m, 13H); MS (ESI) m/z 538 (MH)<sup>+</sup>.</p>\n  Biological Examples</p>\n  The ability of the compounds for treating a vasopressin receptor mediated condition was determined using the following procedures.</p>\n  Example 1</p>\n  In-Vitro Binding Assay</p>\n  Assay buffer is 5OmM Tris-CI, 5mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 % BSA (pH 7.5) containing 5 \u03bcg/mL of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 50 \u03bcg/mL bacitracin, and 1 mM Pefabloc (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, hydrochloride manufactured by Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN and distributed by Boehhnger Mannheim). H3 vasopressin is <sup>3</sup>H-arginine-8- vasopressin (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA; 68.5 Ci/mmol, final concentration in assay is 0.65-0.75 nM). Into the wells of a 96-well round bottom polypropylene plates are added buffer, test compound, membrane (containing \n\n human Vi a or V2 receptor), and H3 vasopressin. The reaction plates are allowed to sit at room temperature for one hour. The samples are filtered through Unifilter GF/C plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) presoaked in 0.3 polyethyleneimine. The plates are washed 5 times with cold physiological saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. After drying, the bottom of the filter plates are sealed and 0.025 ml_ of Microscint-20 (Packard Instrument Co, Meriden, CT) is added to each filter. The top of the plate is sealed, and the plate is counted. Non-specific binding is determined by the addition of 1.25 \u03bcM arginine-8-vasopressin in those wells.</p>\n  The % inhibition for the test results was calculated according to the formula:</p>\n  peak response after drug % Inhibition = 100 - 100 x peak response before drug</p>\n  The results for compounds tested are shown in Table 1.</p>\n  ",

Antagonism against the V2 receptor is determined by measuring cAMP accumulation in transfected HEK- 293 cells expressing the human V-2 receptor (V2-HEK cells). Compounds are tested for their ability to block the stimulatory effects of vasopressin on cAMP accumulation. The cell content of cAMP is measured by radioimmunoassay using NEN flashplates.</p>\n  The results for compounds tested are shown in Table 3.</p>\n  TABLE 3</p>\n  V2 (functional) IC<sub>50</sub> (\u03bcM)</p>\n  Cpd IC<sub>50</sub> Cpd IC<sub>50</sub></p>\n  1 0.054 27 0.39</p>\n  3 0.25 28 0.20</p>\n  4 0.043 29 0.090</p>\n  5 0.066 30 0.090</p>\n  6 0.107 31 0.14</p>\n  7 0.024 32 0.034</p>\n  11 0.040 33 0.031</p>\n  12 1.1 34 0.25</p>\n  13 0.01 1 35 0.044</p>\n  14 0.73 36 0.17</p>\n  15 0.40 37 0.090</p>\n  16 0.074 38 0.040</p>\n  17 1.1 39 0.69</p>\n  18 1.2 40 0.20</p>\n  19 0.12 41 0.70</p>\n  21 1.1 42 0.092</p>\n  22 0.74 43 0.20</p>\n  24 0.22 44 0.066 \n\n Cpd IC 50 Cpd IC<sub>50</sub></p>\n  25 1.0 45 0.55</p>\n  26 0.070 52 0.035</p>\n  Example 4</p>\n  Reversal of Vasopressin-lnduced Hypertension in Rats</p>\n  The anti-hypertensive activity of a compound may be assessed using an anesthetized model of vasopressin-induced hypertension. Male Long Evans, normotensive rats of between 350 and 450 g in body weight are anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, ip) and maintained throughout the procedure with an ip infusion of 10 mg/kg/hr. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is infused at 30 ng/kg/min, iv, to induce a stable hypertensive state (ca. 50 mm Hg increase in mean arterial blood pressure). Compounds of interest are administered in an ascending dose fashion and the maximum decrease in mean arterial blood pressure is recorded. An ED<sub>50</sub> is determined from the linear portion of the dose-response relationship for each animal.</p>\n  Example 5 Diabetic Nephropathy Animal Models</p>\n  Several animal models are believed to mimic various components of diabetic nephropathy in humans, in particular, the streptozotocin-induced model of type 1 diabetes in rats, the db/db genetic mouse model of type 2 diabetes and the 5/6 nephrectomy model of renal failure in rats. Compounds may be evaluated in the streptozotocin diabetic model by administering the compound at 1 , 3 or 10 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks and monitored at several endpoints during the study that are indicative of diabetic kidney disease, including reduced urine albumin, serum creatinine le"
