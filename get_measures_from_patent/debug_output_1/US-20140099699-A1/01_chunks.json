    "Q anion exchange column (8 ml bed volume). Protein was eluted with a linear 0-500 mM NaCl gradient in 10 mM Tris pH 8.1 using an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare). HLA-A*02-peptide complex eluted at approximately 250 mM NaCl, and peak fractions were collected, a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) was added and the fractions were chilled on ice.</p>Biotinylation tagged pHLA molecules were buffer exchanged into 10 mM Tris pH 8.1, 5 mM NaCl using a GE Healthcare fast desalting column equilibrated in the same buffer. Immediately upon elution, the protein-containing fractions were chilled on ice and protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) was added. Biotinylation reagents were then added: 1 mM biotin, 5 mM ATP (buffered to pH 8), 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 \u03bcg/ml BirA enzyme (purified according to O'Callaghan et al. (1999) Anal. Biochem. 266: 9-15). The mixture was then allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight.</p>The biotinylated pHLA-A*02 molecules were purified using gel filtration chromatography. A GE Healthcare Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column was pre-equilibrated with filtered PBS and 1 ml of the biotinylation reaction mixture was loaded and the column was developed with PBS at 0.5 ml/min using an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare). Biotinylated pHLA-A*02 molecules eluted as a single peak at approximately 15 ml. Fractions containing protein were pooled, chilled on ice, and protease inhibitor cocktail was added. Protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie-binding assay (PerBio) and aliquots of biotinylated pHLA-A*02 molecules were stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C.</p>Such immobilised complexes are capable of binding both T-cell receptors and the coreceptor CD8\u03b1\u03b1, both of which may be injected in the soluble phase. The pHLA binding properties of soluble TCRs are observed to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar if the TCR is used either in the soluble or immobilised phase. This is an important control for partial activity of soluble species and also suggests that biotinylated pHLA complexes are biologically as active as non-biotinylated complexes.</p>The BIAcore 3000\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor measures changes in refractive index expressed in response units (RU) near a sensor surface within a small flow cell, a principle that can be used to detect receptor ligand interactions and to analyse their affinity and kinetic parameters. The BIAcore experiments were performed at a temperature of 25\u00b0 C., using PBS buffer (Sigma, pH 7.1-7.5) as the running buffer and in preparing dilutions of protein samples. Streptavidin was immobilised to the flow cells by standard amine coupling methods. The pHLA complexes were immobilised via the biotin tag. The assay was then performed by passing soluble TCR over the surfaces of the different flow cells at a constant flow rate, measuring the SPR response in doing so.</p>Equilibrium Binding ConstantThe above BIAcore analysis methods were used to determine equilibrium binding constants. Serial dilutions of the disulfide linked soluble heterodimeric form of the reference gp100 TCR were prepared and injected at constant flow rate of 5 fll min-1 over two different flow cells; one coated with \u2212300 RU of specific YLEPGPVTA (SEQ ID NO: 1) HLA-A2 complex (or the variant peptide YLEPGPVTV (SEQ ID NO: 6) HLA-A2 complex), the second coated with \u2212300 RU of non-specific HLA-A2-WT1 wt peptide (RMFPNAPYL) complex. Response was normalised for each concentration using the measurement from the control cell. Normalised data response was plotted versus concentration of TCR sample and fitted to a non-linear curve fitting model in order to calculate the equilibrium binding constant, K<sub>D</sub>. (Price &amp; Dwek, Principles and Problems in Physical Chemistry for Biochemists (2<sup>nd </sup>Edition) 1979, Clarendon Press, Oxford). The disulfide linked soluble form of the reference gp100 TCR (Example 2) demonstrated a K<sub>D </sub>of approximately 19 \u03bcM. From the same BIAcore data the TYz was approximately 0.8 s.</p>This affinity determination was also repeated using a variant peptide (YLEPGPVTV\u2014SEQ ID NO: 6) of the gp100 YLEPGPVTA (SEQ ID NO: 1) peptide loaded by the HLA-A*0201. The soluble disulfide-linked reference gp100 TCR has a similar affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) for the YLEPGPVTV (SEQ ID NO: 6)-HLA*0201 complex (approximately 19 \u03bcM) to that obtained for the gp100 YLEPGPVTA (SEQ ID NO: 1)-HLA*0201 complex.</p>Kinetic ParametersThe above BIAcore analysis methods were also used to determine equilibrium binding constants and off-rates.</p>For high affinity TCRs (see Example 4 below) K<sub>D </sub>was determined by experimentally measuring the dissociation rate constant, k<sub>off</sub>, and the association rate constant, k<sub>on</sub>. The equilibrium constant K<sub>D </sub>was calculated as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p>TCR was injected over two different cells one coated with \u2212300 RU of specific YLEPGPVTA (SEQ ID NO: 1) HLA-A*02 complex (or YLEPGPVTV(SEQ ID NO: 6) HLA-A*02 complex when specified), the second coated with \u2212300 RU of non-specific HLA-A2-peptide complex. Flow rate was set at 50 \u03bcl/min. Typically 250 \u03bcl of TCR at a",

The number of ELISPOT spots observed in each well was plotted using Prism (Graph Pad) (see FIG. 11).
