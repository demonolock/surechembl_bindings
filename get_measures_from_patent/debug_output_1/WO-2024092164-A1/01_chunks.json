    "physiochemical properties and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. [0073] A functionally equivalent residue of an amino acid used herein typically can refer to other amino acid residues having physiochemical and stereochemical characteristics substantially similar to the original amino acid. The physiochemical properties include water solubility (hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity), dielectric and electrochemical properties, physiological pH, partial charge of side chains (positive, negative or neutral) and other properties identifiable to a person skilled in the art. The stereochemical characteristics include spatial and conformational arrangement of the amino acids and their chirality. For example, glutamic acid is considered to be a functionally equivalent residue to aspartic acid in the sense of the current disclosure. Tyrosine and tryptophan are considered as functionally equivalent residues to phenylalanine. Arginine and lysine are considered as functionally equivalent residues to histidine. [0074] As used herein, the term \u201cbinding\u201d refers to a non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g., between two proteins and/or peptides). While in a state of non- covalent interaction, the macromolecules are said to be \u201cassociated\u201d or \u201cinteracting\u201d or \u201cbinding\u201d (e.g., when a molecule X is said to interact with a molecule Y, it means that the molecule X binds to molecule Y in a non-covalent manner). Binding interactions can be characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd), for example a Kd of, or a Kd less than, 10<sup>-6</sup> M, 10- <sup>7</sup> M, 10<sup>-8</sup> M, 10<sup>-9</sup> M, 10<sup>-10</sup> M, 10<sup>-11</sup> M, 10<sup>-12</sup> M, 10<sup>-13</sup> M, 10<sup>-14</sup> M, 10<sup>-15</sup> M, or a number or a range between any two of these values. Kd can be dependent on environmental conditions, e.g., pH and temperature. \u201cAffinity\u201d refers to the strength of binding, and increased binding affinity is correlated with a lower Kd. [0075] The wording \u201cspecific,\u201d \u201cspecifically,\u201d or \u201cspecificity\u201d as used herein with reference to the binding of a first molecule to second molecule refers to the recognition, contact and formation of a stable complex between the first molecule and the second molecule, together with substantially less to no recognition, contact and formation of a stable complex between each of the first molecule and the second molecule with other molecules that may be present. Exemplary specific bindings are antibody-antigen interaction, cellular receptor-ligand interactions, polynucleotide hybridization, enzyme substrate interactions etc. The term \u201cspecific\u201d as used herein with reference to a molecular component of a complex, refers to the unique association of that component to the specific complex which the component is part of. The term \u201cspecific\u201d as used herein with reference to a sequence of a polynucleotide refers to the unique association of the sequence with a single polynucleotide which is the complementary sequence. By \u201cstable complex\u201d is meant a complex that is detectable and does not require any \n\narbitrary level of stability, although greater stability is generally preferred. The term \u201cspecific,\u201d \u201cspecifically,\u201d or \u201cspecificity\u201d as used herein with reference to a binding of a targeting peptide to a target protein, e.g., LRP6, refers to the ability of the targeting peptide to form stable complex with a target protein, with substantially less to no binding to macromolecules oth"
