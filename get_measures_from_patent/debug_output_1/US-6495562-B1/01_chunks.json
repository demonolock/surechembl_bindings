    " 96 well polystyrene, flat bottom plate in a 50 mM Tris/0.15 M NaCl+0.5% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma P-5556), pH 7.4 with HCl buffer. The compounds of this invention, 10 mM in DMSO, were diluted with DMSO to eight half log concentrations, for example: 1200 \u03bcM, 400 \u03bcM, 120 \u03bcM, 40 \u03bcM, 12 \u03bcM, 4 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.4 \u03bcM. Four concentrations were chosen, then 5 \u03bcl of each were diluted to a total assay volume of 200 \u03bcL. The final compound concentrations in the assay, according to the above example, were 30 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 0.3 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.03 \u03bcM and 0.01 \u03bcM, respectively. The substrate S-2444 was used at 200 \u03bcM in the assay. Several vials were reconstituted as directed on the vial, aliquoted, and stored frozen The enzyme was further diluted in assay buffer and 10 \u03bcL was used in the assay. Enzyme concentration in the assay was 2-3 nM. The assay was performed as follows: 175 \u03bcL of buffer was pipetted into the polystyrene plate, and 5 \u03bcL solution of a compound of this invention in DMSO was added. The mixture was vortexed, treated with 10 \u03bcL of enzyme in buffer, vortexed, treated with 10 \u03bcL of substrate in water, and vortexed. The plate was placed in a Spectromax\u00ae (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif.) plate reader to follow the course of the reaction for 15 minutes at 405 nm. The Spectromax\u00ae calculated the reaction rates which were used to calculate percent inhibition of the compounds of this invention versus the reaction rate of the enzyme in the absence of any inhibitor. The Ki's of the inhibitors were calculated from the percent inhibition and previously established Km. The compounds of this invention inhibit urokinase as shown by the data for representative examples in Table 1.</p>TABLE 1Inhibitory Potency of Representative Compounds Against UrokinaseExampleKi (\u03bcM)ExampleKi (\u03bcM)10.041290.3620.48300.27830.025310.3540.059320.3550.021331.4470.045340.05180.021350.12890.050360.054100.142370.010110.128380.04120.025390.037130.26400.81140.143410.014150.16460.18160.12480.029170.25490.278180.047500.043190.144510.123200.084520.53210.084530.343220.291540.343230.058550.255240.054560.018250.063570.025260.048580.010270.13590.010280.058600.015</p>The pharmacokinetic behavior of selected compounds of formula (I) were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In a series of parallel studies, group rats (n=3/group) and female cynomolgus monkeys (n=3/group) received a single 5 mg/kg IV or oral dose of selected compounds of formula (I). The compounds were prepared as solutions in either 0.2% hydroxpropyl methyl cellulose in water containing approximately 5% DMSO or in an ethanol:propylene glycol:D5W vehicle containing sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid (as needed for solubility) for both oral and IV dosing. All animals were fasted overnight prior to dosing and throughout the study. Water was provided freely. Sequential blood samples were obtained from each animal at selected time points after dosing. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4\u00b0 C.",
