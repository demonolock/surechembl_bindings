    "nd CAR protein levels are reduced by protein degradation, the phenotypic and functional indicators of T cell exhaustion are reversed and T cell function is restored.</p>The invention is not limited to any particular RDD. Indeed, any RDD that confers CAR instability such that rapid CAR protein degradation occurs when the RDD is not stabilized by the presence of its cognate small molecule, yet whose structure or presence within the CAR does not disrupt CAR function may be used in the invention. A non-limiting example of an RDD is derived from the FK506 binding protein (FKBP), referred to herein as an FKBP DD (see Banaszynski et. al, Cell 2006). Surface expression of a CAR containing the FKBP RDD can be rapidly and dose-dependently regulated by adding or subtracting the stabilizing rapalog shield-1 (S1) to CAR T cells or to an organism treated with CAR T cells comprising an FKBP DD. Another non-limiting example of an RDD is derived from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), referred to herein as a DHFR DD, which can be rapidly and dose-dependently regulated with the stabilizing small molecule drug trimethoprim. As described herein, in some embodiments, CAR expression is achieved in vivo using a clinically established and well tolerated dose of trimethoprim (see Kremers et al., J Clin Pharmacol. 1974 Feb-Mar;14(2):112-7). For example, maximum expression of a CAR comprising the trimethoprim-controlled DHFR RDD occurred at about 500 nM of trimethoprim, well within the compound's EC50 of 50 nM. This is well within the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim when taken 160 mg twice a day (1.72 \u03bcg/mL, about 6 \u03bcM). In some embodiments, CAR expression is achieved in vivo using a dose that is below a clinically established dose of trimethoprim.</p>In some embodiments, the DHFR DD is derived from E. coli DHFR. In some embodiments, the DHFR DD is derived from human DHFR. Similarly, the invention is not limited by the type RDD used. For example, any DHFR that contains mutations that achieve destabilization of the DHFR domain and any protein attached thereto may be used. For example, any RDD (DHFR or FKBP DD) that confers instability/destabilization such that rapid protein degradation occurs when the RDD is not stabilized, using for example trimethoprim or S1, yet whose structure or presence within a CAR does not disrupt CAR effector function can be used. In some embodiments, an E. coli DHFR DD of SEQ ID NO. 6 that contains mutations at amino acids 12 and 100 is used.</p>The invention is not limited by the location of the RDD within the CAR. For example, in some embodiments, an RDD is fused (e.g., genetically linked) on the N- or the C-terminus of the CAR. A CAR can be expressed with an RDD fused to an intracellular component of the CAR, fused to an extracellular component of the CAR, or fused to a hinge or transmembrane region. Exemplary intracellular components of the CAR include, but are not limited to, a co-stimulatory domain or the CD3-zeta",
    " a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a T cell that expresses a CAR, wherein the CAR comprises a binding moiety that specifically interacts with a predetermined target, a zeta chain portion comprising for example the intracellular domain of human CD3-zeta, a costimulatory signaling region, and an RDD.</p>In some embodiments, the present invention provides a cellular therapy where T cells are genetically modified to express a CAR containing an RDD and the CAR T cell is infused to a recipient in need thereof. The infused cell is able to kill tumor cells expressing the CAR T cell's target antigen in the recipient. Unlike other biologic therapies, CAR T cells are able to replicate in vivo resulting in long-term persistence that can lead to sustained tumor control. In some embodiments, a CAR T cell comprising a CAR including an RDD displays a prolonged anti-tumor response (e.g., compared to CAR T cell comprising a CAR lacking an RDD). In some embodiments, inclusion of an RDD within the CAR serves as a type of safety switch to inhibit CAR T cell activity/functionality (e.g., to mitigate CAR toxicity). For example, in some embodiments, removal of a stabilizing small molecule or drug (e.g., trimethoprim) from the CAR T cells results in rapidly reduced or inhibited expression of the CAR on the surface of the CAR T cell, thereby effectively shutting down or preventing targeting and effector functions of the CAR T cell. In particular, as shown in Example 2, the IC50 (the time it takes for 50% of surface CAR to be degraded), was observed to be less than 2 hours in the absence of stabilizing drug/molecule (see Example 2, FIG. 13). Therefore, in some embodiments, removing stabilizing drugs from patients who receive DD-CARs serves as a rapid and reversible safety switch. Thus, the invention provides, in some embodiments, the ability to mitigate or eliminate toxicity events that may occur with CAR T cell therapies, such as, but not limited to, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or on-target off-tumor toxicity. Further, in the context of on-target off-tumor toxicity, in some embodiments, the invention makes possible the ability to titrate down the dose of stabilizing drug such that a CAR T cell therapy recognizes a desired target (e.g., tumor antigen) but not healthy tissue.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR T cells of the invention undergo robust in vivo T cell expansion and persist for an extended period of time. In another embodiment, the CAR T cells of the invention evolve into specific memory T cells that can be reactivated to inhibit any additional tumor formation or growth. For example, GD2-specific CAR T cells of the invention can undergo robust in vivo T cell expansion and persist at high levels for an extended amount of time in blood and bone marrow and form specific memory T cells.</p>The anti-tumor immunity response elicited by the CAR-modified T cells may be an active or a passive immune response. In addition, the CAR mediated immun"
