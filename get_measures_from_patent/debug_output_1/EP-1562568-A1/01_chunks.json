    " conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. \n\nIn addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered by controlled release means and/ or delivery devices such as for example those described in U.S. Pat. Nos-: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>Several thousands of scientific publications describe various aspect of the preclinical and clinical pharmacology of racemic albuterol. An increasing number of publications deal with the in vitro and in vivo effects of R- and S- albuterol.</p>The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples describing in detail the pharmacological characterization of the compound, and the preparation of compositions of the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that many modifications, both to materials, and methods, may be practiced without departing from the purpose and interest of this invention.</p>Example 1. Affinity to Adrenergic Beta-Receptors.</p>R(-)-albuterol is an adrenergic beta-receptor agonist with affinity to both adrenergic \u03b2-1 and \u03b2-2 receptors. As shown in the following table, R(-)-albuterol is twice as potent as the corresponding racemate, while the S(+)-isomer is practically inactive. Comparison of Affinities for Human \u03b2-1 and \u03b2-2 adrenergic receptors</p>Compound Kd for \u03b2-2 Kd for \u03b2-1 receptors (nM) receptors (nM)</p>RS-albuterol 668 2980</p>R(-)-albuterol 236 1540 \n\nS(+)-albuterol 33,600 111,000</p>Conclusion:</p>R(-)-albuterol, but not S(+)-albuterol had affinity for the adrenergic beta-2 receptor.</p>It is believed that the very weak affinity for beta-receptors by S(+)-albuterol was due to optical impurities of R(-)-albuterol, since the test samples of S(+)- salbutamol used in these studies that had an optical purity ranging from 97% to</p>&gt;99%</p>Example 2. Effects on cAMP Production</p>Stimulation of adrenergic \u03b2-2 receptors result in an increased intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).</p>Results: The production of cAMP in human PC3 cells has been studied and the EC50-values for cAMP production were calculated to be 207nM for RS-albuterol, lOOnM for R(-)-albuterol and 14,000nm for S(+)-albuterol.</p>Conclusion: R(-)-albuterol, but not S(+)-albuterol increased the production of intracellular cAMP.</p>The very weak activity of S(+)-albuterol in this study was probably due to optical impurities of R(-)-albuterol and/ or to a weak intrinsic activity of the</p>S(+)-isomer.</p>Example 3. Effects on Airway Smooth Muscle Contractions The following study was performed in vitro, using isolated guinea pig tiacheas. The airway smooth muscle tissues were contracted by carbachol or ovalbumin or histamine. The inhibitory effects of R(-)- and S(+)-albuterol were calculated. Results: pD2 Values of the Enantiomers of Albuterol</p>Contractile stimulus S-albuterol R-albuterol</p>Carbachol (10-6M) 4.1 (2.5 5.7) 7.1 (7.0-7.3) \n\nOvalbumin (10-5 g/ml) 4.5 (1.9-7.2) 8.3 (7.9-8.6)</p>Histamine (10-5M) 5.3 (4.6-6.0) 7.7 (7.5-7.9)</p>Conclusions: R(-)-albuterol, but not S(+)-albuterol demonstrated potent airway smooth muscle relaxing activity. The very weak activity of S(+)-albuterol in this study was probably due to optical impurities of R(-)-albuterol and/ or to a weak intrinsic activity of S(+)-albuterol</p>Example 4, Hyperreactivity by S-albuterol in equine tracheal smooth muscle. In this study, segments of equine bronchial smooth muscle are mounted on special holders and immersed in a physiologic solution containing glucose and aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO"
