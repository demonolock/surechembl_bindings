    "t1 or MEGF4 nucleic acids. These are: </p>[0011] i) the use of a nucleic acid coding for Slit1 or MEGF4 and/or of a Slit1 or MEGF4 peptide or protein for the detection of cancer or for the detection of a risk of a cancer disease, a tissue sample (of the respective organ, an arbitrary tissue sample for the detection of metastases from the below cancer types) being examined for the transcription or over-transcription of Slit1 or MEGF4 RNA or for the transcription or over-expression of a Slit1 or MEGF4 protein, preferably a nucleic acid coding for Slit1 or MEGF4 or a detector substance binding to a Slit1 or MEGF4 protein or peptide being used, said detector substance preferably comprising a reporter group, the binding of the said nucleic acid and/or the said protein or peptide to the detector substance being detected in a semi-quantitative or quantitative manner, and the cancer disease preferably being selected from the group comprising \u201cprostate cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreas cancer and lung cancer\u201d, </p>[0012] ii) the use of a Slit1 or MEGF4 RNA or of a Slit1 or MEGF4 protein or peptide for screening for substances binding thereto, in particular prospective drugs for inhibiting the said RNA or the said protein or peptide or prospective detector substance, a prospective substance or a mixture of such prospective substances being contacted with the said RNA or the said protein or peptide, binding events being determined by means of a binding assay, and a binding prospective substance being selected, if applicable after deconvolution, </p>[0013] iii) the use of a substance inhibiting Slit1 or MEGF4 for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer and/or a metastases generation from a primary tumor, the cancer disease or the primary tumor, respectively, being selected from the group comprising \u201cprostate cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreas cancer and lung cancer\u201d. </p>[0014] A substance used for the invention may be selected from the group comprising: </p>[0015] a) antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA, and ribozymes against a nucleic acid according to claim 1, </p>[0016] b) an organic molecule binding to a peptide or protein according to claim 2, in particular identified according to claim 5, and having a molecular weight below 5,000, preferably below 1,000, most preferably below 300, </p>[0017] c) an aptamer against a protein or peptide according to claim 2, in particular identified according to claim 5, </p>[0018] d) a (monoclonal) antibody, in particular human or humanized antibody against a protein or peptide according to claim 2, </p>[0019] e) an anti-idiotypic non-human (monoclonal) antibody, generated by means of an antibody of the sub-group d), and </p>[0020] f) the above substances derivatized with a reporter group, a cell toxin, an immuno-stimulating component and/or a radio isotope. </p>[0021] In the case a), a hammerhead ribozyme may for ",
    "s detected in 8 of 14. </p>[0060] Thus it is proven that the expression of Slit1/MEGF4 in at least 50% of the prostate tumors are up-regulated, so that Slit1/MEGF4 is suited for the detection of prostate tumors, and that a physiological relation between up-regulation and the disease symptoms and thus an inhibition of Slit1/MEGF4 is suited for the treatment of the tumor disease. </p>Example 2 Detection of Slit1/MEGF4 by Means of Antibodies [0061] Polyclonal antibodies (AB) were grown against Slit1 protein (Seq.-ID 9; AB-a) and against human SLIT1/MEGF4 proteins (Seq.-ID 10; AB-b), conjugated with a carrier protein, in rabbit and affinity purified with the specific immobilized peptides. </p>[0062] With the above AB's, Western blots were made for the detection of Slit1 and/or MEGF4 in prostate tumor and non-malignant normal prostate epithelium cell lines and in breast tumor cell lines. For this purpose, lysates from the whole cells (wc) or of the membrane fraction (mem) were prepared, denaturated and separated by means of SDS phage gel electrophoresis. After blotting the separated proteins on a membrane and blocking unspecific protein interactions, the membrane was incubated with AB-a and/or AB-b antisera over night at 4\u00b0 C. With an anti-rabbit coupled horse radish peroxidase as a secondary antibody, the specific Slit1 and/or MEGF4 bands were detected. The results are shown in FIG. 3. By means of AB-a was made the detection in all cell lines at a molecular weight of approx. 190 kD. By means of AB-b, Slit1 (approx. 190 kD) as well as MEGF4 (approx. 180 or 210 kD) became visible. The specificity of the detected proteins was verified with not shown competition experiments under addition of specific or unspecific peptides at the incubation with the AB's. </p>[0063] In addition to the expression shown in FIG. 3 of Slit1/MEGF4 protein in prostate tumor cell lines, an expression was found in not shown experiments in the breast tumor cell lines MaTu and MDA 231 or MDA-MB-231. </p>Example 3 Immunohistochemical Detection of Prostate Tumor Cells [0064] Tissue samples from prostate tumor cells were incubated with AB-a as a primary antibody, a biotinylated secondary anti-rabbit antibody and a streptavidin-coupled horse radish peroxidase, and the coloration was performed with DAB as a chromogenic substrate (brown coloration). The counter-coloration took place with a haemalaun solution (blue coloration). Malignant and normal epithelium cells were distinguishable, the malignant cells having a strong coloration, i.e. high Slit1 content, whereas the normal epithelium cells were only moderately colored. The cuts are shown in FIG. 4, same as the negative controls performed without AB-a. </p>Example 4 [0065] In this example, the localization of Slit1 or MEGF4 was examined. For this purpose, PC3 (prostate tumor cell line) cells were subjected to a Facs analysis under application of AB-a and AB-b for Slit1 and for Slit1/MEGF4. </p>[0066] In FIG. 5a, the results for AB-a and in FIG. 5b the results for AB-b are shown.
