The substrate is then added and the mixture is incubated at 37 \u2103 for 30 to 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped at 4 \u2103 and the fluorescence reading was done by reading a Berthold Twinkle LS970B plate. Inhibition curves were then plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration using GraphPad software, and Ki was then determined from the Cheng Prusoff equation: ki \u2550 IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+(S/Km))\u3002</p><p id=\"p0412\" num=\"0407\">Nephrinase (NEP) assay</p><p id=\"p0413\" num=\"0408\">Nephrinase purified from rabbit kidney (Aubry M et al (1987), BioChemiformecell Biol 65,398-404) was used in 50mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 at a final concentration of 200 ng/mL.

The fluorogenic substrate (L) -Ala- \u03b2 -naphthylamide (1mM) was added in a final volume of 100. mu.L and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u2103. The fluorescence values were measured on a Berthold Twinkle LB 970(\u03bb ex 340nm, \u03bb em 405nm, lamp energy 10000). Samples containing 0% hydrolysis were obtained by adding substrate to the buffer and samples with 100% relative activity were prepared without inhibitor. Percent lysis was assessed and compared to 100% relative activity, and IC was determined<sub>50</sub>The value is obtained. Using the equation Ki \u2550 IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+[S]k/Km) the Ki values of the inhibitors (average of at least three duplicate independent determinations) were calculated.</p><p id=\"p0418\" num=\"0413\"><u>As a result: inhibitory potency NEP, APN, LTA4H</u></p><p id=\"p0419\" num=\"0414\">H-CO-N(OH)-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH(R<sub>1</sub>)-CO-NH-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>CH(R<sub>2</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-CO-R<sub>3</sub>(1)</p><p id=\"p0420\" num=\"0415\">[ Table 1]</p><p id=\"p0421\" num=\"0416\"></p><p id=\"p0422\" num=\"0417\">nd: not measured</p><p id=\"p0423\" num=\"0418\"><u>Pharmacological test</u></p><p id=\"p0424\" num=\"0419\">Figure 1 shows that intravenous binding OF an inactive dose OF THC and compound Ib-1 induced a considerable synergistic analgesic effect in a hotplate test OF male OF1 mice 10 minutes after injection.</p></mode-for-invention></description>"
