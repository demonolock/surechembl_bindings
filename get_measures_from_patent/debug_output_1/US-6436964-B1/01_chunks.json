    " ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash chromatography to provide the free base of the title compound (0.024 g). The free base was dissolved in methanol, treated with oxalic acid (4.6 mg) and concentrated under vacuum to provide the title compound, mp 100-102\u00b0 C.</p>Serotonin-1<sub>A </sub>Receptor and Serotonin-2<sub>A </sub>Receptor Activity</p>The compounds of the present invention are active at the serotonin-1<sub>A </sub>receptor and at the serotonin-2<sub>A </sub>receptor, particularly as antagonists and as partial agonists at that receptor. Previously known compounds with that activity typically have the disadvantage of possessing other non-serotonin related central nervous system activities as well. It is now well understood by pharmacologists and physicians that pharmaceuticals which have a single physiological activity, or which are much more active in the desired activity than in their other activities, are much more desirable for therapy than are compounds which have multiple activities at about the same dose.</p>The 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor binding potency and the 5-HT<sub>2a </sub>receptor binding potency of the present compounds are measured by techniques well known in the art. For example, the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor binding potency is measured by a modification of the binding assay described by Taylor, et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 236, 118-125, 1986); and Wong, et al., Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 46, 173-77 (1993). Membranes for the binding assay are prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-250 g). The animals are killed by decapitation, and the brains are rapidly chilled and dissected to obtain the hippocampi. Membranes from the hippocampi are either prepared that day, or the hippocampi are stored frozen (\u221270\u00b0) until the day of preparation. The membranes are prepared by homogenizing the tissue in 40 volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4 at 22\u00b0) using a homogenizer for 15 sec., and the homogenate is centrifuged at 39800\u00d7g for 10 min. The resulting pellet is then resuspended in the same buffer, and the centrifugation and resuspension process is repeated three additional times to wash the membranes. Between the second and third washes the resuspended membranes are incubated for 10 min. at 37\u00b0 to facilitate the removal of endogenous ligands. The final pellet is resuspended in 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to a concentration of 2 mg of tissue original wet weight/200 \u03bcl. This homogenate is stored frozen (\u221270\u00b0) until the day of the binding assay. Each tube for the binding assay has a final volume of 800 \u03bcl and contains the following: Tris-HCl (50 mM), pargyline (10 \u03bcM), CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(3 mM), [<sup>3</sup>H]8-OH-DPAT (1.0 nM), appropriate dilutions of the drugs of interest, and membrane resuspension equivalent to 2 mg of original tissue wet weight, for a final pH of 7.4. The assay tubes are incubated for either 10 min. or 15 min. at 37\u00b0, and the contents are then rapidly filtered through GF/B filters (pretreated with 0.5% polyethylenimine), followed by four one-ml washes with ice-cold buffer. The radioactivity trapped by the filters is quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and specific [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to the 5-HT1A sites is defined as the difference between [3H]8-OH-DPAT bound in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM 5-HT.</p>IC50 values, i.e., the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the binding, are determined from 12-point competition curves using nonlinear regression (SYSTAT, SYSTAT, Inc., Evanston, Ill.). IC50 values are converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Biochem. Pharmacol., 22, 3099-3108 (1973).</p>Additional binding assays of some of the present compounds are carried out by an assay method which uses a cloned cell line which expresses the serotonin-1A receptor, rather than the hippocampal membranes. Such cloned cell lines have been described by Fargin, et al., J.Bio. Chem., 264, 14848-14852 (1989), Aune, et al., J. Immunology, 151, 1175-1183 (1993), and Raymond, et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 346, 127-137 (1992). Results from the cell line assay are substantially in agreement with results from the hippocampal membrane assay.</p>As was reported by R. L. Weinshank, et al., WO93/14201, the 5-HT1A receptor is functionally coupled to a G-protein as measured by the ability of serotonin and serotonergic drugs to inhibit forskolin stimulated cAMP productionin NIH3T3 cells transfected with the 5-HT1A receptor. Addenylate cyclase activity is determined using standard techniques. A maximal effect is achieved by serotonin. An Emax is determined by dividing the inhibition of a test compound by the maximal effect and determining a percent inhibition. (N. Adham, et al., supra,; R. L. Weinshank, et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 89,3630-3634 (1992)), and the references cited therein.</p>[<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S Binding Method</p>Agonist activation of G protein-coupled receptors results in the release of GDP (guanosine-5\u2032-diphosphate) from the \u03b3-subunit of the G protein and the subsequent binding of GTP (guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate). The binding of the stable analogue [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S (guanosine 5\u2032-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]) can be used as an indicator of this receptor activation (see Wieland, T., Jakobs, K. H., 1994. Measurement of receptor-stimulated guanosine 5\u2032-O-(\u03b3-thio)triphosphate binding by G proteins. Methods Enzymol. 237, 3-13.). EC<sub>50 </sub>and efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) values can be determined. Similarly, antagonists will inhibit agonist-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding. From these experiments, IC<sub>50 </sub>values, converted to a dissociation constant, e.g. K<sub>i</sub>, and efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) values can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>Measurement of cAMP Formation</p>Transfected NIH3T3 cells (estimated Bmax from one point competition studies=488 fmol/mg of protein) are incubated in DMEM, 5 mM theophylline, 10 mM HEPES (4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and 10 \u03bcM pargyline for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 5% carbon dioxide. Drug dose-effect curves are then conducted by adding 6 different final concentrations of drug, followed immediately by the addition of forskolin (10 mM). Subsequently, the cells are incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 5% carbon dioxide. The medium is aspirated and the reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mM hydrochloric acid. To demonstrate competitive antagonism, a dose-response curve for 5-HT is measured in parallel, using a fixed dose of methiothepin (0.32 mM). The plates are stored at 4\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500\u00d7g to pellet cellular debris, and the supernatant is aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. before assessment of cAMP formation by radioimmunoassay (cAMP radioimmunoassay kit; Advanced Magnetics, Cambridge, Mass.). Radioactivity is quantified using a Packard COBRA Auto Gamma counter, equipped with data reduction software. Representative compounds are tested for 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor antagonist activity in the cAMP assay.</p>5HT<sub>1a </sub>Antagonist, In Vivo Tests</p>a) 5HT<s",
    "the B-OH-DPAT induced behaviors and hypothermia. Lower lip retraction (LLR) and flat body posture (FBP) are recorded in male Sprague Dawley rats (\u02dc250 grams from Harlan Sprague Dawley). Both LLR and FBP are measured on a scale of 0-3 (Wolff et al, 1997). In the LLR behavioral assay, \u201c0\u201d indicates normal lip position; \u201c1\u201d indicates a slight separation of the lips; \u201c2\u201d indicates that the lips are open with some teeth visible; \u201c3\u201d indicates that the lips are fully open with all the front teeth exposed. In the FBP assay, a score of \u201c0\u201d indicates normal body posture; \u201c1\u201d indicates that the stomach is on the floor with the back in its normal rounded position; \u201c2\u201d indicates that the stomach is on the floor with the back straightened and rising from the shoulders to the hips; \u201c3\u201d indicates that the stomach is pressed into the floor and the back is flattened with the shoulders and hips even. Core body temperature is recorded by rectal probe inserted 5.0 cm immediately after the behavioral measures. Rats are injected subcutaneous with compound (at 0, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) 35 minutes before scoring and the 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous) is injected 20 minutes before scoring.</p>b) 5HT<sub>1a </sub>Agonist Subcutaneous Test</p>The compounds are also tested at a high dose of 10 mg/kg subcutaneous alone to see if they induced 5HT<sub>1a </sub>agonist-like hypothermia.</p>The efficacy of the compounds of the invention to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin is determined by a paroxetine binding assay, the usefulness of which is set out by Wong, et al., Neuropschopharmacology, 8, 23-33 (1993). Synaptosomal preparations from rat cerebral cortex are made from the brains of 100-150 g Sprague-Dawley rats which are killed by decapitation. The cerebral cortex is homogenized in 9 volumes of a medium containing 0.32 M sucrose and 20 \u03bcM glucose. The preparations are resuspended after centrifugation by homogenizing in 50 volumes of cold reaction medium (50 \u03bcM sodium chloride, 50 \u03bcM potassium chloride, pH 7.4) and centrifuging at 50,000 g for 10 minutes. The process is repeated two times with a 10-minute incubation at 37\u00b0 C. between the second and third washes. The resulting pellet is stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until use. Binding of <sup>3</sup>H-paroxetine to 5-HT uptake sites is carried out in 2 ml reaction medium containing the appropriate drug concentration, 0.1 nM <sup>3</sup>H-paroxetine, and the cerebral cortical membrane (50 \u03bcg protein/tube). Samples are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes; those containing 1 \u03bcM fluoxetine are used to determine nonspecific binding of <sup>3</sup>H-paroxetine. After incubation, the tubes are filtered through Whatman GF/B filters, which are soaked in 0.05% polyethylenimine for 1 hour before use, using a cell harvester by adding about 4 ml cold Tris buffer (pH 7.4), aspirating, and rinsing the tubes three additional times. Filters are then placed in scintillation vials containing 10 ml scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity is measured b"
