    "scence (RFU) at 620 nm after excitation with 320 nm light. Inhibitor compounds, prepared at 3x the desired final concentration in 1x BACE assay buffer (20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Brij-35) supplemented with 7.5% DMSO were pre-incubated with an equal volume of autoBACE-2 enzyme diluted in 1x BACE assay buffer (final enzyme concentration 1 nM) in black 384-well NUNC plates for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C. The assay was initiated by addition of an equal volume of the QSY7-EISEVNLDAEFC-Eu-amide substrate (200 nM final concentration, K<sub>m</sub>=8 \u00b5M for 4 \u00b5M for autoBACE-2) prepared in 1x BACE assay buffer supplemented with 7.5% DMSO and incubated for 90 minutes at 30\u00b0C. DMSO was present at 5% final concentration in the assay. Following laser excitation of sample wells at 320 nm, the fluorescence signal at 620 nm was collected for 400 ms following a 50 \u00b5s delay on a RUBYstar HTRF plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). Raw RFU data was normalized to maximum (1.0 nM BACE/DMSO) and minimum (no enzyme/DMSO) RFU values. IC<sub>50s</sub> were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) of percent inhibition data with minimum and maximum values set to 0 and 100 percent respectively. Similar IC<sub>50s</sub> were obtained when using raw RFU data. The K<sub>i</sub> values were calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.</p>All of the example compounds of the invention were tested in this BACE-2 assay, and their Ki values are recorded in the table below.</p>The novel iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit properties which are expected to render them advantageous as BACE inhibitors and/or for the various methods of used herein.</p>Cortical A\u03b2<sub>40</sub>The iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have been found, surprisingly and advantageously, to exhibit improved efficacy in lowering A\u03b2<sub>40</sub> production in the cerebral cortex than their iminopyrimidone analogs. The following procedures were used. Results are shown in the table below.</p>Rat Tissue CollectionMale CD rats (~100 g; Crl:CD(SD); Charles River Laboratories, Kingston, NY) were group housed and acclimated to the vivarium for 5-7 days prior to use in a study. Compounds were formulated in 20% hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and administered orally with a dosing volume of 5 ml/kg for rats. Three h after drug administration, rats were euthanized with excess CO<sub>2</sub>. The brain was removed from the skull and immediately frozen on dry ice. All tissues were stored at -70\u00b0C until A\u03b2 quantification.</p>Determination of A\u03b2<sub>40</sub>Levels in Rat Cortex by ELISAThe measurement of endogenous rat A\u03b2-40 (A\u03b240) in cortex relied on the 585 antibody (Ab585, BioSource), catalogue no. NONO585), which specifically recognizes the N-terminal sequence of rodent A\u03b240, and the monoclonal antibody, G2-10, which specifically recognizes the free C-terminus of A\u03b240. Ab585 wa"
