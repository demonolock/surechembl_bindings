    " identical to, its counterpart expressed in normal cells. It is preferably not expressed by normal cells. Alternatively, it is expressed at a level at least two-fold higher (e.g., a two- old, three- fold, five-fold, ten-fold, 20-fold, 40-fold, 100-fold, 500-fold, 1,000-fold, 5,000-fold, or 15, 000-fold higher) in a tumor cell than in the tumor cell's normal counterpart. Examples of relevant cancers include, without limitation, hematological cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas, neurological tumors such as astrocytomas or glioblastomas, melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal tumors such as gastric or colon cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, genitourinary tumors such ovarian cancer, vaginal cancer, bladder cancer, testicular cancer, prostate cancer or penile cancer, bone tumors, and vascular tumors. Relevant TAA include, without limitation, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate specific antigen (PSA), MAGE (melanoma antigen) 1-4, 6 and 12, MUC (mucin) (e.g., MUC- 1 , MUC-2, etc.), tyrosinase, MART (melanoma antigen), Pmel 17(gp 100), GnT-V intron V sequence (N-acetylglucoaminyltransferase V intron V sequence), Prostate Ca psm, PRAME (melanoma antigen), \u03b2-catenin, MUM-l-B (melanoma ubiquitous mutated gene product), GAGE (melanoma antigen) 1, BAGE (melanoma antigen) 2- 10, C-ERB2 (Her2/neu), EBNA (Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen) 1 -6, gp75, human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 and E7, p53, lung resistance protein (LRP) Be 1 -2, and Ki-67. Both CTL and helper T cells have been shown to be efficient effectors of tumor immunity. Other peptide epitopes that can be included in the fusion agents of the invention are those derived from autoantigenic polypeptides that are involved in the initiation or progression of autoimmune diseases. Examples of such autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), muscular dystrophy (MD), myasthenia gravis (MG), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Examples of appropriate autoantigenic polypeptides include, without limitation: (a) in regard to MS (or experimental autoimmune encephalitis), myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG), and alpha B-crystallin; (b) in regard to RA, collagen; (c) in regard to MG, the acetylcholine receptor; (d) in regard to SLE, the Smith protein, RNP ribonucleoprotein, and SS-A and SS-B proteins; and (e) in regard \n\nto IDDM, insulin/proinsulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (65kD isoform; GAD-65), and IA-2. Other autoimmune diseases and polypeptides that have been implicated as autoantigens involved in their genesis are listed below:</p>\n  Autoimmune ovarian failure: 3\u03b2 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Graves' thyroiditis: thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor</p>\n  Hashimoto's thyroiditis: thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase</p>\n  Primary hypo hyroidism: thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxida"
