    "ing solutes). A liquid meal was artificially digested in the presence of pepsin and pancreatic juice to produce gastrointestinal (GI) simulant. The sequence of addition of enzymes and the pH profile were controlled so that the digestion process was simulated down to the jejunum level:</p>The following components were added one at a time in the following order: Powder Milk 291 g, Beneprotein 72.8 g, Dextrose 152 g, Polycose 156 g, NaCl 17.6 g to \u02dc2.5 L of ddH<sub>2</sub>O until they dissolved (they were stirred vigorously, but foaming was avoided). After the NaCl had dissolved 240 g of Corn Oil was added. Then the volume was brought up to 4 L with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 hours. At this time pH was \u02dc6.4. Then, 153 ml of 3M HCl was added drop wise to a final pH of 2.0 (\u02dc150 ml). The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, after which time the pH rose to \u02dc2.1. Then 800 ml of pepsin in 10 mM HCl was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was stirred at RT for 30 minutes, after which time the pH was \u02dc2.3. Then 5 L of a stock solution of Pancreatin and Bile Salts in 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.4 was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml Pancreatin and 2 mg/ml Bile Salts. The mixture was stirred for 120 minutes at room temperature, after which the pH was \u02dc6.5. Meal mimic was stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. for up to one month before use.</p>An aliquot of the GI simulant was centrifuged and the supernatant assayed for phosphate. The phosphate binding assay was like the one described above with non-interfering buffer, except that liquid of the GI simulant was used.</p>Binding Capacity in Ex-Vivo Aspirates</p>Using a tube placed in the lumen of the small intestine, healthy patients were given a meal of the same composition as the one prepared for the GI simulant described above and aliquots of chyme were then sampled.</p>Subjects were intubated with a double lumen polyvinyl tube with a mercury-weighted bag attached to the end of the tube to facilitate movement of the tube into the small intestine. Using fluoroscopy to direct placement, one aspiration aperture of the double lumen tube was located in the stomach, and the other aperture was at the Ligament of Treitz (in the upper jejunum).</p>After correct tube placement, 550 mL of the liquefied test meal (supplemented with a marker, polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u20142 g/550 mL) was infused into the stomach through the gastric aperture at a rate of 22 mL per minute. It required approximately 25 minutes for the entire meal to reach the stomach, simulating the duration of time required to eat normal meals.</p>Jejunal chyme was aspirated from the tube whose lumen was located at the Ligament of Treitz. This fluid was collected continuously during 30 minute intervals for a two and a half hour period. This resulted in 5 specimens that were mixed, measured for volume, and lyophilized.</p>A phosphate binding assay was carried out on the ex-vivo aspirates. The phosphate binding procedure was like the one described above with non-interfering buffer, except that the ex-vivo aspirate liquid was used (after reconstitution of the freeze-dried material in the proper amount of de-ionized water). The phosphate binding capacities in the ex-vivo aspirate was calculated in the same way as in GI simulant experiments.</p>Example 2Libraries of Crosslinked Polymers Formed in a Bulk Solution Process and Measurement for Phosphate Binding CapacityCreation of Polymer Libraries</p>The following five examples each comprise a library comprising up to 24 crosslinked polymers. Polymers were prepared in batch reactors arranged in a 4\u00d76 array format. Each reactor had either a 350 microliters or a 3 ml volume, was magnetically stirred, and temperature-controlled. In a typical procedure, amine, crosslinkers, solvents and optionally base were dispensed robotically in each reactor, optionally under agitation. The reactors were then sealed and heated up to the indicated temperature for 15 hours. The reactor array was then dismounted and plugs of crosslinked polymers transferred in glass vials, ground, washed repeatedly with de-ionized water, and lyophilized. The five libraries are identified below in Table 3 along with the corresponding reaction conditions used in their creation.</p>TABLE 3LibraryReaction temperatureReactor volumeExampleidentification(\u00b0 C.)(microliters)1100275853502100277603503100279803"
