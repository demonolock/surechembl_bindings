The K<sub>D </sub>of an agent linked to a particle (K<sub>D, particle</sub>) may be about the same as the K<sub>D </sub>of the agent either free in solution or linked to an exposed surface (K<sub>D, free</sub>) for soluble forms of a target biomolecule (e.g., K<sub>D, particle</sub>\u00f7K<sub>D, free </sub>may be from 0.1 to 10, such as 0.2 to 5, 0.5 to 2, 0.8 to 1.2, or 0.9 to 1.1 for agent and soluble targets).</p>Particles comprising a plurality of reactive groups may thus be linked to an agent (e.g., an antibody, Fab, scFv, or ligand of a cell-surface receptor) to engineer particles that selectively bind soluble forms of a target (e.g., an antigen and/or soluble form of a cell-surface receptor) but that do not appreciably bind membrane-bound forms of the target. Such particles may be utilized in vivo or in vitro, for example, to reduce the concentration of a soluble target in a fluid without exposing the agent to membrane-bound forms of the target.</p>I. BiomoleculeThe soluble biomolecule is, generally, a first member of a specific binding pair. As used herein, a \u201cbinding partner,\u201d \u201cspecific binding partner,\u201d or a \u201cmember of a specific binding pair,\u201d generally comprises any member of a pair of binding members that bind to each other with substantial affinity and specificity. A pair of binding partners may bind to one another to the substantial exclusion of at least most or at least substantially all other components of a sample, and/or may have a dissociation constant of less than about 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, or 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, among others. A pair of binding partners may \u201cfit\u201d together in a predefined manner that relies on a plurality of atomic interactions to cooperatively increase specificity and affinity. Binding partners may be derived from biological systems (e.g., receptor-ligand interactions), chemical interactions, and/or by molecular imprinting technology, among others. Exemplary corresponding pairs of binding partners, also termed specific binding pairs, are presented in Table 1, with the designations \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d being arbitrary and interchangeable.</p>The term \u201cbiomolecule\u201d as used herein, refers to any molecule that may exert an effect on a living organism. In some embodiments, the biomolecule is an atom, such as lithium or lead (e.g., the biomolecule may be a metal cation). In some embodiments, the biomolecule is not an atom or metal ion. For example, the biomolecule may be a molecule, such as an organic compound or inorganic compound. In some embodiments, the biomolecule is a drug, such as warfarin or dabigatran. The biomolecule may be a psychoactive drug, such as diacetylmorphine. The biomolecule may be a poison, toxin, or venom. The biomolecule may be an allergen. The biomolecule may be a carcinogen. The biomolecule may be the agent of a chemical weapon, such as a nerve agent. The biomolecule may be a molecule that is endogenous to the organism, ",
    " apoptotic body. A particle may specifically bind to a low-density lipoprotein, e.g., to sequester low-density lipoprotein particles.</p>The biomolecule may be a ligand of a cell surface receptor. The ligand may be a naturally-occurring ligand or a synthetic ligand. The ligand may be a native ligand of the receptor (e.g., a ligand that is produced by a subject in vivo) or a non-native ligand (e.g., a ligand that is introduced into the subject, such as a virus or drug). The biomolecule may be a ligand for a cytosolic receptor or a nuclear receptor.</p>TABLE 1Examples of specific binding pairs.First Binding PartnerSecond Binding PartnerCell Surface Receptor (e.g., TNFNatural Ligand (e.g, TNF\u03b1)receptor)Viral Coat or Envelope Protein (e.g,Corresponding Cellular ReceptorHIV-1 gp120)(e.g, CD4)Botulinum ToxinSynaptotagmin II Cell SurfaceReceptorSoluble Receptor (e.g, soluble TNFRNatural Ligand (e.g, TNF\u03b1 oror soluble IL-2 receptor)IL-2)</p>Tumor cells are known to protect themselves from host immune surveillance by shedding soluble forms of cytokine receptors, which soluble receptors bind to the cytokines produced by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. For example, cancer cells shed soluble forms of TNF receptor and other cytokine receptors, such as IL-2 receptor and TRAIL receptor. These soluble receptors confer a growth advantage to cancer cells by relieving the cells of the pro-apoptotic effects of the TNF\u03b1, IL-2, and TRAIL. Karpatova et al. report the shedding of the 67 kD laminin receptor by human cancer cells, which may augment tumor invasion and metastasis (J Cell Biochem 60(2):226-234 (1996)). Thus, the particles described herein can be engineered for scavenging soluble forms of cell surface receptor proteins, e.g., for use in the treatment of cancer.</p>Accordingly, in some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein is expressed by a cancer cell and/or the cell surface receptor protein is a protein shed by the cancer cell as a soluble form of the cell surface receptor protein. In some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein, when activated, induces apoptosis (e.g., a death receptor). In some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein is a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) protein (e.g., TNFR-1 or TNFR-2). In some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein is a Fas receptor protein. In some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein is a TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAILR) protein, 4-1BB receptor protein, CD30 protein, EDA receptor protein, HVEM protein, lymphotoxin beta receptor protein, DR3 protein, or TWEAK receptor protein. In some embodiments, the cell surface receptor protein is an interleukin receptor protein, e.g., an IL-2 receptor protein. It is understood that in such embodiments, the target soluble biomolecule can be a soluble form of the cell surface receptor, e.g., shed from a cancer cell.</p>In some embodiments, the biomolecule is soluble Tim3 (\u201cT-Cell Ig Mucin 3\u201d).

The biomolecule may have a molecular weight of about 3 amu to about 10<sup>7 </sup>amu, such as about 100 amu to about 10<sup>7 </sup>amu, about 3 amu to about 10<sup>6 </sup>amu, about 3 amu to about 10<sup>5 </sup>amu, about 100 amu to about 10<sup>6 </sup>amu, or about 400 amu to about 10<sup>6 </sup>amu. The biomolecule may have a molecular weight of about 10<sup>5 </sup>amu to about 10<sup>7 </sup>amu.</p>The terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d \u201cselectively binds,\u201d and like grammatical terms, as used herein, refer to two molecules forming a complex that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Typically, binding is considered specific when the association constant (k<sub>a</sub>) is higher than 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>. Thus, a first member of a specific binding pair can specifically bind to the second member of the binding pair with a k<sub>a </sub>of at least (or greater than) 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>(e.g., at least or greater than 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>9</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>11</sup>, 10<sup>12</sup>, 10<sup>13</sup>, 10<sup>14</sup>, or 10<sup>15</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>or higher). In some embodiments, a selective interaction has a dissociation constant (k<sub>d</sub>) of less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>(e.g., 8\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, 2\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, or 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>).</p>Specific binding does not refer to an interaction that is primarily driven by a non-specific electrostatic interaction or a non-specific hydrophobic interaction, which may have a favorable association constant. For example, nucleic acids, which are negatively charged, may bind to a cationic particle with a favorable association constant, independent of a specific interaction, and such binding is not \u201cspecific binding\u201d as defined herein. Similarly, a lipid may bind to a hydrophobic particle with a favorable association constant, independent of a specific interaction, and such binding is not \u201cspecific binding\u201d as defined herein.</p>In some embodiments, the biomolecule and the particle have the same charge at physiological pH (\u02dc7.4). For example, the biomolecule may have a negative charge and the particle may have a negative charge or the biomolecule may have a positive charge and the particle may have a positive charge. In some embodiments, the biomolecule and the particle have opposite charges at physiological pH. For example, the biomolecule may have a positive charge and the particle may have a negative charge or the biomolecule may have a negative charge and the particle may have a positive charge. In some embodiments, the biomolecule has a neutral charge at physi"
