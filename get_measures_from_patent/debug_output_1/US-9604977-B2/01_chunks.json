Coli and purified, huFABP5 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., cat.no. 10010364), bound to Terbium labeled anti His6 tag antibody. Assay read-outs reflected energy transfer, upon binding of the ligand to the FABP protein, from the Terbium donor molecule to the acceptor Bodipy moiety. Final ligand concentration (125 nM) approximated the Kd for each protein.</p>Stock DMSO solutions (1.8 mM) of compounds were serially diluted 3-fold for ten concentrations with 100% DMSO (50 \u03bcM to 0.003 \u03bcM final compound concentration). 1 \u03bcl of these compound dilutions and 1 \u03bcl of Bodipy labeled fatty acid 4.5 \u03bcM in 100% DMSO (Bodipy FL C11, cat. no. D3862, Invitrogen) were sequentially pipetted in wells of 384-well black polypropylene plates (Thermo Matrix cat. no. 4344). FABP4 or FABP5 protein was then added (28 \u03bcl of 64 nM protein in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml \u03b3-globulin, 1 mM DTT, 0.012% NP40, final protein concentration: 50 nM). Assay blanks contained ligand, but no protein. Neutral controls contained ligand, but no compound. After adding the detection reagent (Tb antiHis6 antibody, Columbia Biosciences, TB-110, 6 \u03bcl of a 24 nM Ab solution in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml \u03b3-globulin, final Tb antiHis6 Ab concentration: 4 nM), plates were spun one minute at 1000 rpm. Following an incubation at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes, plates were read using an Envision reader (Perkin Elmer, Extinction wavelength: 340 nm, Emission: 490 nm and 520 nm, time delay: 100 \u03bcs; time window: 200 \u03bcs, 50 flashes).</p>Final assay conditions were: 50 nM FABP protein, 125 nM Bodipy labeled fatty acid, 0.009% (vol/vol) NP40, 5.5% (vol/vol) DMSO in a total final assay volume of 36 \u03bcl. The assay was performed in triplicate.</p>The relative fluorescence units (RFU) ratio (520 nm*10000488 nm) were used to calculate the percent inhibition:"
