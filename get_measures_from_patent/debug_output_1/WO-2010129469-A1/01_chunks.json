    "ponents which are significantly toxic to the subjects to which the formulation would be administered.</p>The phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" is art recognized and includes a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, suitable for administration to mammals. The carriers include liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject agent from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to or impacting safety of the patient.</p>\"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients\" (vehicles, additives) are those which can reasonably be administered to a subject mammal to provide an effective dose of the active ingredient employed.</p>The term \"excipient\" refers to an agent which may be added to a formulation to provide a desired consistency, e.g., altering the bulk properties, to improve stability, and/or to adjust osmolality. Examples of commonly used excipients include, but are not limited to, sugars, polyols, amino acids, surfactants, and polymers.</p>A commonly used excipient is a polyol. As used herein, a \"polyol\" is a substance with multiple hydroxyl groups, and includes sugars (reducing and nonreducing sugars), sugar alcohols and sugar acids. Preferred polyols herein have a molecular weight which is less than about 600 kD (e.g., in the range from about 120 to about 400 kD). Non-limiting examples of polyols are fructose, mannose, maltose, lactose, arabinose, xylose, ribose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, trehalose, sorbose, melezitose, raffinose, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, threitol, sorbitol, glycerol, L- gluconate and metallic salts thereof.</p>As used herein, \"buffer\" refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH by the action of its acid-base conjugate components. The buffers of this invention have a \n\n pH in the range from about 4 to about 8; preferably from about 4.5 to about 7; and most preferably has a pH in the range from about 5.0 to about 6.5. Examples of buffers that will control the pH in this range include phosphate, acetate (e.g., sodium acetate), succinate (such as sodium succinate), gluconate, glutamate, histidine, citrate and other organic acid buffers. In one embodiment, a buffer suitable for use in the formulations of the invention is a citrate and phosphate buffer.</p>The term \"surfactant\" generally includes those agents which protect a protein in a formulation from air/solution interface-induced stresses and solution/surface induced- stresses. For example, a surfactant may protect the protein from aggregation. Suitable surfactants may include, e.g., polysorbates, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as Brij 35. RTM., or poloxamer such as Tween 20, Tween 80, or poloxamer 188. Preferred detergents are poloxamers, e.g., Poloxamer 188, Poloxamer 407; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, e.g., Brij 35.RTM., Cremo",
    "ts can detect Rayleigh scatter, which typically changes linearly with concentration, in the absence of association or nonideality effects. Other methods for assessing physical stability are well-known in the art.</p>An antibody \"retains its chemical stability\" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the antibody is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by, e.g., detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the antibody. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g. clipping) which can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALD FTC<sup>1</sup>F MS), for example. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g. occurring as a result of deamidation or oxidation) which can be evaluated by ion-exchange chromatography, for example.</p>An antibody \"retains its biological activity\" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the antibody in a pharmaceutical formulation is biologically active for its intended purpose. For example, biological activity is retained if the biological activity of the antibody in the pharmaceutical formulation is within about 30%, about 20%, or about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared (e.g., as determined in an antigen binding assay). In a pharmacological sense, in the context of the present invention, a</p>\"therapeutically effective amount\" or \"effective amount\" of an antibody refers to an amount effective in the prevention or treatment or alleviation of a symptom of a disorder \n\n for the treatment of which the antibody is effective. A \"disorder\" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predisposes the subject to the disorder in question. \"Treatment\" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.</p>The phrases \"parenteral administration\" and \"administered parenterally\" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intriacranial, intraarticular, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion. The phrases \"systemic administration,\" \"administered systemically,\" \"peripheral administration\" and \"administered peripherally\" as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. The term \"human TNF-alpha\" (abbreviated herein as hTNF-alpha, TNF\u03b1, or simply hTNF), as used herein, is intended to refer to a human cytokine that exists as a 17 kD secreted form and a 26 kD membrane associated form, the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound 17 kD molecules. The structure of hTNF-alpha is described further in, for example, Pennica, D., et al. (1984) Nature 312:724-729; Davis, J. M., et al. (1987) Biochem 26:1322-1326; and Jones, E. Y., et al. (1989) Nature 338:225-228. The term human TNF-alpha is intended to include recombinant human TNF-alpha (rhTNF- alpha), which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression methods or purchased commercially (R &amp; D Systems, Catalog No. 210-TA, Minneapolis, Minn.). The term \"antibody\", as used herein, is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Other naturally occurring antibodies of altered structure, such as, for example, camelid antibodies, are also included in this definition. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHl, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a \n\n light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs,",

The starting solution is a solution of purified antibody at low concentration (lower than the high concentrations of the invention) in a liquid buffer, for example in a buffer resulting from the preceding manufacturing process step. In this case, adalimumab solution was provided at a concentration of about 70 mg/mL in a buffer system identical to F7 without surfactant at pH 5.2. The starting solution is then concentrated and diafiltered by ultrafiltration, preferably in a tangential-flow filtration system, using a membrane able to retain quantitatively the antibody, for example with a cutoff of 10 kD.</p>As an example, the representative formulations F2 and F6 were manufactured by diluting the concentrate to about 50 mg/L using the corresponding matrix without surfactant as diafiltration buffer. A continuous buffer exchange was conducted using the tangential-flow filtration system. The diafiltration was generally carried out at constant retentate volume, with at least 5 volumes, or preferably 8 volumes, of diafiltration buffer. In a last step, the diafiltered solution was further concentrated to a high concentration, for example higher or equal to 150 mg/mL. The final turbid retentate was then recovered out of the ultrafiltration system by flushing the tubes with diafiltration buffer. After the addition of the respective amount of polysorbate 80 and adjusting to the target protein concentration using diafiltration buffer, a high concentration liquid formulation was obtained, which was clear to slightly opalescent. After filtration through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, the solution was stable for at least about 12 months if stored at about 2-8 <sup>0</sup>C.</p>Example 3: Stability Of High Concentration Adalimumab Formulation Against Freeze/Thaw Stress</p>In order to demonstrate that adalimumab formulations are stable at 100 mg/mL protein concentrations, freeze/thaw stress (freezing performed at -80<sup>0</sup>C, thawing performed at 25\u00b0C) experiments were carried out.</p>An array of analytical methods sensitive to particle formation was used to detect potential physical instabilit"
