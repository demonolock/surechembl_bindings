    "h the oxindole structure is substituted in position 3 by two alkyl radicals which may also together form a cycloalkyl radical (spiro linkage), as ligands of vasopressin receptors. As alternative, the spiro ring may comprise heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen (optionally with substituents).</p>WO 95/18105 describes 1-phenylsulfonyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-ones having a nitrogen atom in position 3 as ligands of vasopressin receptors. In addition, radicals selected from optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl radicals are bonded in position 3.</p>WO 03/008407 describes 1-phenylsulfonyloxindoles in which pyridylpiperazines are linked via a urea, carbamate or 2-oxoethyl group to the oxindole in position 3.</p>WO 2005/030755 describes as example 105 5-chloro-1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenylsulfonyl)-3-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl 4-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate.</p>WO 2006/005609 describes as example 66 the dihydrochloride of 4-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-[5-chloro-1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenylsulfonyl)-3-(2-ethoxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl]carboxamide.</p>Besides the binding affinity for the vasopressin V1b receptor, further properties may be advantageous for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of vasopressin-dependent disorders, such as, for example:</p>1.) a selectivity for the vasopressin V1b receptor compared with the vasopressin V1a receptor, i.e. the quotient of the binding affinity for the V1a receptor (Ki(V1a) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d) and the binding affinity for the V1b receptor (Ki(V1b)) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d). A larger quotient Ki(V1a)/Ki(V1b) means a greater V1b selectivity;</p>2.) a selectivity for the vasopressin V1b receptor compared with the vasopressin V2 receptor, i.e. the quotient of the binding affinity for the V2 receptor (Ki(V2) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d) and the binding affinity for the V1b receptor (Ki(V1b)) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d). A larger quotient Ki(V2)/Ki(V1b) means a greater V1b selectivity;</p>3.) a selectivity for the vasopressin V1b receptor compared with the oxytocin OT receptor, i.e. the quotient of the binding affinity for the OT receptor (Ki(OT) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d) and the binding affinity for the V1b receptor (Ki(V1b)) (determined in the unit \u201cnanomolar (nM)\u201d). A larger quotient Ki(OT)/Ki(V1b) means a greater V1b selectivity.</p>4.) the metabolic stability, for example determined from the half-lives, measured in vitro, in liver microsomes from various species (e.g. rat or human);</p>5.) no or only low inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes: cytochrome P450 (CYP) is the name for a superfamily of heme proteins having enzymatic activity (oxidase). They are also particularly important for the degradation (metabolism) of foreign substances such as drugs or xenobiotics in mammalian organisms. The principal representatives of the types and subtypes of CYP in the human body are: CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4. If CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. grapefruit juice, cimetidine, erythromycin) are used at the same time as medicinal substances which are degraded by this enzyme system and thus compete for the same binding site on the enzyme, the degradation thereof may be slowed down and thus effects and side effects of the administered medicinal substance may be undesirably enhanced;</p>6.) a suitable solubility in water (in mg/ml);</p>7.) suitable pharmacokinetics (time course of the concentration of the compound of the invention in plasma or in tissue, for example brain). The pharmacokinetics can be described by the following parameters: half-life (in h), volume of distribution (in l\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>), plasma clearance (in l\u00b7h<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>), AUC (area under the curve, area under the concentration-time curve, in ng\u00b7h\u00b7l<sup>\u22121</sup>), oral bioavailability (the dose-normalized ratio of AUC after oral administration and AUC after intravenous administration), the so-called brain-plasma ratio (the ratio of AUC in brain tissue and AUC in plasma);</p>8.) no or only low blockade of the hERG channel: compounds which block the hERG channel may cause a prolongation of the QT interval and thus lead to serious disturbances of cardiac rhythm (for example so-called \u201ctorsade de pointes\u201d). The potential of compounds to block the hERG channel can be determined by means of the displacement assay with radiolabelled dofetilide which is described in the literature (G. J. Diaz et al., Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods, 50 (2004), 187-199). A smaller IC50 in this dofetilide assay means a greater probability of potent hERG blockade. In addition, the blockade of the hERG channel can be measured by electrophysiological experiments on cells which have been transfected with the hERG channel, by so-called whole-cell patch clamping (G. J. Diaz et al., Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods, 50 (2004), 187-199).</p>It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds for the treatment or prophylaxis of various vasopressin-dependent diseases.
