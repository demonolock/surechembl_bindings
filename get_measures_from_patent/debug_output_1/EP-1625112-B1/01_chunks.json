    "S 2 mM and PotassiumPhosphate 5mM, pH = 7,4) containing rotenone (an in- : hibitor of clomplex 1) and oligomyocin (an inhibitor of the ATP-synthase) and the rate of oxygen consumptions is measured, when stabilized nutrient (e.g. succinate) is added and an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption is measured. When the rate of oxygen consumption again has stabilized the test compound is added and the oxygen consumption is measured. If the test compound stimulates the rate of oxygen consumption, it is regarded as a chemical uncoupler.</p>Assay (111): Identification of chemical uncouplers that increase energy expenditure in vivoThe effect of the chemical uncouplers on energy expenditure (oxygen consumption) in vivo is determined by indirect calorimetry. Briefly, animals are placed in airtight chambers. Air is continuously led to and from the chambers. The gas concentrations of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbondioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the air led to and from the chambers (inlet and outlet air) are recorded and the consumption of O<sub>2</sub> and the production of CO<sub>2</sub> are calculated. Based on the amount of O<sub>2</sub> consumed and CO<sub>2</sub> produced, energy expenditure is calculated. Compounds which at a given dose increase whole body energy expenditure without obvious deleterious effects are deemed to be chemical uncouplers that increase energy expenditure.</p>Table 1 shows assay results for compounds of the presents invention.\nTABLE 1Example No.GlucosFSK4 EC50(\u00b5M)GlucosFSK4 Slope(dimensionless)GlucosFSK4 Slope(% of FCCP)11.4110020.80.7549390.75654&gt;10568.40.8537101.2594891.40.451010.6531112.20.8431261.3641340.8741142.30.96815101.177163.20.9552177.40.9555181.70.5529195.10.7541202.81.5584210.70.7541220.41.6590231.20.642240.7157250.51.8103263.71.5138273.50.7346280.584292.91.1833010.8693120.6548320.61.183331.10.7558342.30.9572353.31.292363.80.6473710.6548380.70.650390.51.155400.60.758410.90.633429431.74430.8414534611.161470.80.736481.51.155492.2501.2151510.90.8655210.763</p>"
