Selective ligands for GABAA receptors may also be effective as pre-medication prior to anaesthesia or minor procedures such as endoscopy, including gastric endoscopy.</p>\n  In addition, the compounds in accordance with the present invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting compounds capable of binding to the human GABAA receptor.</p>\n  WO 98/04559 describes a class of substituted and 7,8-ring fused [l,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine derivatives which are stated to be selective ligands for GABAA receptors beneficial in the treatment and/or prevention of neurological disorders including anxiety and convulsions. The present invention provides a particular triazolo-pyridazine derivative, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which possess desirable binding properties at various GABAA receptor subtypes. The compounds in accordance with the present invention have good affinity as ligands for the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit of the human GABAA receptor. The compounds of this invention interact more favourably with the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit than with the \u03b1l subunit. Indeed, the compounds of the invention exhibit functional selectivity in terms of a selective efficacy for the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit relative to the \u03b1l subunit.</p>\n  The compounds of the present invention are GABAA receptor subtype ligands having a binding affinity (Ki) for the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit, as measured in the assay described hereinbelow, of less than 1 nM. \n\nFurthermore, the compounds in accordance with this invention exhibit functional selectivity in terms of a selective efficacy for the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit relative to the \u03b1l subunit. Moreover, the compounds according to the present invention possess interesting pharmacokinetic properties, notably in terms of improved oral bioavailability.</p>\n  The present invention provides 7-ieri-butyl-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-6- (2H-[l,2,4]triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-[l,2,4]triazolo[4,3-6]pyridazine of formula I:</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  (i<sup>)</sup> or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p>\n  The present invention also provides 7-terf-butyl-3-(2-fluorophenyl)- 6-(2H-[l,2,4]triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-[l,2,4]triazolo[4,3-6]pyridazine of formula I as depicted above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in isolated form.</p>\n  The compounds in accordance with the present invention are encompassed within the generic scope of WO 98/04559. There is, however, no specific disclosure therein of the compound of formula I as depicted above, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. For use in medicine, the salts of the compound of formula I above will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compound of formula I or of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable \n\nsalts of the compound of formula I include ac",
    "om cells. PBS (approximately 20 ml) is added. The cells are scraped and placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The procedure is repeated with a further 10 ml of PBS to ensure that most of the cells are removed. The cells are pelleted by centrifuging for 20 min at 3000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge, and then frozen if desired. The pellets are resuspended in 10 ml of buffer per tray (25 cm x 25 cm) of cells.</p>\n  Assay Can be carried out in deep 96-well plates or in tubes. Each tube contains:</p>\n  \u2022 300 \u03bcl of assay buffer.</p>\n  \u2022 50 \u03bcl of [<sup>3</sup>H]-fLumazenil (final concentration for \u03b1l\u03b23\u03b32: 1.8 nM; for \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32: 1.8 nM; for \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32: 1.0 nM). \n\n\u2022 50 \u03bcl of buffer or solvent carrier (e.g. 10% DMSO) if compounds are dissolved in 10% DMSO (total); test compound or flunitrazepam (to determine non-specific binding), 10 \u03bcM final concentration.</p>\n  \u2022 100 \u03bcl of cells. Assays are incubated for 1 hour at 40\u00b0C, then filtered using either a</p>\n  To tec or Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters followed by 3 x 3 ml washes with ice cold assay buffer. Filters are dried and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Expected values for total binding are 3000-4000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if using liquid scintillation counting, or 1500-2000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if counting with meltilex solid scintillant. Binding parameters are determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis, from which the inhibition constant Ki can be calculated for each test compound. The compound of the accompanying Examples was tested in the above assay, and was found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]- flumazenil from the \u03b12 and or \u03b13 subunit of the human GABAA receptor of less than 1 nM.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 1</p>\n  7-ter^-Butyl-3-(2-fluorophenv -6-(2H-ri.2.41triazol-3-ylmethoxy - f 1.2.4] triazolo \\4, 3 - b)\u03c5 ridazine</p>\n  a) 7-terit-Butyl-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-6-r2-(2-(trimethylsilanyl)ethoxymethyl)- 2H-[1.2,4]triazol-3-ylmethoxy1-fl.2.41triazolo 4.3-blpyridazine</p>\n  To a solution of [2-(2-(trimethylsilanyl)ethoxymethyl)-2H- [l,2,4]triazol-3-yl]methanol (180 mg, 0.79 mM, WO 98/04559) and 7-teri- butyl-6-chloro-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-[l,2,4]triazolo[4,3-6]pyridazine (200 mg, 0.66 mM, WO 00/47582) in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 ml) was added a solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (0.72 ml of a 1 M solution in \n\ntetrahydrofuran) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h.
