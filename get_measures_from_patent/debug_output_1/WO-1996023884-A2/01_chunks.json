    "presence of bound nucleic acid probe. Examples of detection reagents include, but are not limited to radiolabelled probes, enzymatic labeled probes (horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase) , and affinity labeled probes (biotin, avidin, or steptavidin) . in detail, a compartmentalized kit includes any kit in which reagents are contained in separate containers. Such containers include small glass containers, plastic containers or strips of plastic or paper. Such containers allow the efficient transfer of reagents from one compartment to another compartment such that the samples and reagents are not cross- contaminated and the agents or solutions of each container can be added in a quantitative fashion from one compartment to another. Such containers will include a container which will accept the test sample, a container which contains the probe or primers used in the assay, containers which contain wash reagents (such as phosphate buffered saline, Tris-buffers, and the like) , and containers which contain the reagents used to detect the hybridized probe, bound antibody, amplified product, or the like. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the nucleic acid probes described in the present invention can readily be incorporated into one of the established kit formats which are well \n\nknown in the art .</p>VI. Expression of recombinant hPPARy or hPPAR\u03b32 polypeptide.</p>Applicant expressed recombinant hPPARy in vitro. One predominant band estimated to be about 50 kd was observed. This is compatible with translation initiation at the third ATG codon from the 5 ' -end (position 214, SEQ. I.D. No. 1) . A lower band is observed in the in vi tro translated hPPARy polypeptides, which could be a degraded hPPARy polypeptide or a hPPARy polypeptide translation from an internal methionine.</p>Amino acid sequence comparison of hPPARy with other PPAR subtypes shows that human PPARy has 96% identity to mPPAR\u03b3l and 55% identity to both hPPAR\u03b1 and hNUC. The closest homology among PPAR subtypes is in the DNA binding domains, followed by the ligand binding domains. The N-terminal A/B domain, which in the PPAR family encodes a transactivation function, is very different in the three human PPAR subtypes, suggesting that these human PPAR subtypes may have different transactivation properties.</p>The present invention also relates to a recom\u00ac binant DNA molecule comprising, 5' to 3 ' , a promoter effective to initiate transcription in a host cell and the above-described nucleic acid molecules. In addition, the present invention relates to a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a vector and an above-described nucleic acid molecules. The present invention also \n\n 43 relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a transcriptional region functional in a cell, a sequence complimentary to an RNA sequence encoding an amino acid sequence corresponding to the above-described polypeptide, and a transcriptional termination region functional in said cell.
