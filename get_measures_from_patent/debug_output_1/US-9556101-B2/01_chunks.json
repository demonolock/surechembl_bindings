    " by leelamine using the protocols provided by the Kinexus company as described in Yamada, R. et al., N. J Med Chem, 54:2902-14; and Cao, X. et al., Curr Cancer Drug Targets, 2009, 9:189-201. In brief, UACC903 cells are treated with 3 \u03bcmol/L leelamine for 3-24 hours, lysates collected and processed by Kinexus using 812-antibody microarray analysis. Kinexus 812-antibody microarray results are analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Significantly up-regulated or down-regulated pan-specific and phosphor proteins with corresponding Swiss-Prot accession numbers and ratio changes are uploaded as an Excel spreadsheet file to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis server and pathways identified.</p>Leelamine decreases activity of the STAT as well as PI3 and MAP kinases pathways, which are three major signaling pathways promoting melanoma development. Decreased signaling through each pathway following treatment with 3 to 6 \u03bcmol/L of leelamine for 3 to 24 hours is shown for PI3 kinase pathway in FIG. 13, STAT pathway in FIG. 14 and MAP kinase pathway in FIG. 15. Similar signaling inhibition is observed for both UACC 903 and 1205 Lu cell lines, with inhibition of PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways occurring at 3 to 6 hours while inhibition of the STAT pathway occurs from 12 hours of treatment, FIG. 14.</p>Leelamine Decreased the Proliferative Potential of Melanoma Cells Leading to Increased Apoptosis and Decreased Vascular Development.</p>Rates of cell proliferation (using Ki-67), apoptosis (using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) and tumor angiogenesis (using CD31 staining) are quantified in time and size matched tumors treated with leelamine compared with DMSO treated control animals to identify the underlying mechanism by which leelamine inhibits melanoma tumor development using an established method described in Sharma, A. et al., Clin Cancer Res, 2009, 15:1674-85; Madhunapantula, S. V. et al., Mol Cancer Ther, 2008, 7:1297-308; Sharma, A. et al., Cancer Res, 2006, 66:8200-9; and Stahl, J. M. et al., Cancer Res, 2003, 63:2881-90. Size and time matched tumors at each time are compared to identify the first statistically quantifiable difference(s) affected by leelamine treatment in the rates of processes regulating tumor development i.e. cell proliferation, apoptosis or vascular development. Briefly, the mechanism by which leelamine delays tumor development is established by comparing size and time matched melanoma tumors treated with leelamine compared to DMSO vehicle treated animals. 2.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>UACC 903 cells are injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into nude mice, generating tumors of the same size developing at parallel time points. Six days later, mice are treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with DMSO vehicle or leelamine (7.5 mg/kg body weight) daily up to day 15. Tumors are harvested at 11, 13 and 15 days for comparison of rates of cellular proliferation, apoptosis and vessel density by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis as described in Sharma, A. et al., Cancer Res, 2006, 66:8200-9; and Stahl, J. M. et al., Cancer Res, 2003, 63:2881-90. Cell proliferation is measured using mouse anti-human Ki-67 staining from Pharmigen (San Diego, Calif.). Apoptosis rates are scored using \u201cterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)\u201d TMR Red Apoptosis kit from Roche (Mannheim, Germany). Vessel density indicative of apoptosis is estimated using a purified rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody immunostaining (Pharmingen). The number of Ki-67 and TUNEL positive cells is quantified as the percentage of total cells in tumors using the IP Lab imaging software program. For CD31, the area occupied by blood vessels is measured. For all tumor analyses, a minimum of 6 different tumors with 4-6 fields per tumor is analyzed and results represented as the average\u00b1SEM.</p>At day 11, a statistically significant 50% reduction in proliferating cells is observed after leelamine treatment but not in cellular apoptosis or vascular development rates compared with DMSO control treated animals as shown in FIG. 16, FIG. 17 and FIG. 18, sP&lt;0.05, two-way analysis of variance. Similar significant differences in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and vascular development are detected in all tumors compared with DMSO controls at days 13 and 15, suggesting that lack of proliferation subsequently triggers apoptosis and decreased vascular development as shown in FIG. 16, FIG. 17 and FIG. 18, P&lt;0.05, two-way analysis of variance).</p>Western Blot Analysis.</p>For Western blot analysis, cell lysates are harvested by addition of RIPA lysis buffers containing 25 mM Tris.HCl pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM sodium molybdate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, and 5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin. The cell lysates are harvested and processed as described in Madhunapantula, S. V. et al., Cancer Res, 2007, 67:3626-36. Treatment conditions: 1-1.5\u00d710<sup>6 </su"
