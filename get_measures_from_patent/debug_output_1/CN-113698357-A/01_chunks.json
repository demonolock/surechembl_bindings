The interaction between Tag1-PD-L1 and Tag2-PD-1 was examined by using anti-Tag1-Europium (HTRF donor) and anti-Tag2-XL665 (HTRF acceptor). When the donor and acceptor antibodies are brought into proximity due to the tight binding of PD-L1 and PD-1, excitation of the donor antibody induces a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ((FRET) towards the acceptor antibody, which in turn emits specifically at 665 nm. this specific signal is proportional to the extent of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. therefore, compounds that block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction will result in a reduction in the HTRF signal.</p>The test method comprises the following steps: the compounds of the invention were tested for their inhibitory effect on PD-1/PD-L1, in accordance with the instructions. Dosing, control and negative control groups were preplaced in 384-well plates, with triplicate wells per group. Sequentially adding 4 mu L of LTag1-PD-L1 working solution and 4 mu L of Tag1-PD-1 working solution into each hole, and uniformly blowing and beating; then 2. mu.L of compound diluent is added into each well, mixed evenly and incubated for 15min at room temperature, Anti-Tag1-Europium and Anti-Tag2-XL665 are added into each well in sequence, the membrane is sealed and incubated for 2 h in dark, a Tecan microplate reader is used to read fluorescence values (Ex:320 nM; Em:620 and 665nM), and then the inhibition rate and "
