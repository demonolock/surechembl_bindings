    " a porosity of 50 \u03bcm and washed with 70 L of sterile saline solution (0.9% W/V). The washed cells (fresh weight 35 kg) were supplemented with 350 g of citric acid and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax.</p>The homogenized cells were dried. 4450 g of Rch-PsMW homogenate were obtained from 100 litres of cell suspension.</p>Biological Test of Antioxidant Activity with the Cell Line Rc-F2P</p>The assay of antioxidant activity was performed using the DPPH method. The assay with the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl) radical has the aim of evaluating, in vitro, the antioxidant activity of the line of Rosa canina Rc-F2P vis-\u00e0-vis a stained stable radical and measuring its disappearance by spectrophotometry.</p>The methanol solution of DPPH is purple in colour and shows maximum absorbance at a wavelength 517 nm. When DPPH is reacted with an antioxidant compound capable of yielding a hydrogen radical, a destaining of the solution from purple to yellow occurs, due to the disappearance of the DPPH radical, which can be monitored over time spectrophotometrically at the wavelength of maximum absorbance, 517 nm.</p>The Rc-F2P homogenate of meristematic cells of Rosa canina was extracted in methanol and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. Various aliquots of solution were taken and they were added to a same amount of DPPH solution and brought to volume with methanol, so as to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the sample at different concentrations. The results are expressed as EC50, i.e. as the concentration of the Rc-F2P phytocomplex capable of decreasing the initial absorbance of the radical at 517 nm by 50%. The result is then compared with that obtained from a methanol solution of ascorbic acid, used as a reference. The lower the EC50, the greater the antioxidant capacity.</p>Table 8 shows the antioxidant activity of the homogenate of the line Rc-F2P.</p>TABLE 8SampleEC50 \u03bcg/mLHomogenate Rc-F2P38.82 \u00b1 5.71\u2002Ascorbic acid (reference)3.19 \u00b1 0.16\nBiological Test on the Increase in the Biosynthesis of Aquaporins-3 on Reconstructed Skin with the Cell Line Rch-PsMW\n</p>The evaluation of the increase in the expression of aquaporins-3 was carried out at the VitroScreen laboratories (Milan) using homeostatic reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) models. The evaluation of the increase in the biosynthesis of aquaporins-3 by the Rch-PsMW line of Rosa chinensis was carried out using both topical applications (15 \u03bcl of a saline solution containing 0.1% w/w of cellular homogenate) and systemic applications (0.1% w/w of homogenate in the maintenance culture medium of the microtissue) on RHE.</p>After the topical application, the RHE was incubated for 24 hours (at 37\u00b0 C. 5% CO2). The systemic application was carried out by adding 0.1% of extract into the maintenance culture medium of the epidermis and incubating the RHE for 24 hours.</p>After incubation, the microtissues were collected in order to perform an immunostaining analysis and PCR. To evaluate the expression of aquaporins-3, use was made of an immunohistochemical technique that envisaged the use of the anti-aquaporin-3 antibody (Abcam), followed by an evaluation of antigen-antibody binding using a fluorescence microscope.
