    "of the encephalomyocarditis virus. In the resulting construct, the phosphotransferase gene was downstream of the HCV 5\u2032 NTR (containing the HCV IRES), while the HCV nonstructural genes were downstream of the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES. RNA was transcribed from this construct and transfected into the human hepatoma cell line, Huh-7. After selection in neomycin, cell lines were obtained which showed robust replication of the transfected mini-genome; viral RNA could be detected by Northern analysis and viral proteins could be detected by immunoprecipitation. There is an urgent need for additional animal models of HCV infection. </p>[0009] HCV entry into host cells requires attachment of the viral particle to the cell surface, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane. This process is mediated by the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Two proteins, named E1 and E2 (corresponding to amino acids 192-383 and 384-750 of the HCV polyprotein respectively), have been suggested to be external proteins of the viral envelope which are responsible for the binding of virus to target cells. HCV E1 and E2 have been expressed recombinantly in a number of forms and using a variety of expression systems. Two recent reports have described fusion and entry mediated by E1 and E2 ectodomains fused to the TM domain of the VSV G envelope glycoprotein. [28][49]</p>[0010] In mammalian cell-based expression systems, the molecular weight of mature, full length E1 is \u02dc35 kD and that of E2 is \u02dc72 kD. [19][31][48] The amino-terminal residues of mature E1 and E2 were determined experimentally. [21] Endoproteolytic processing of the HCV polyprotein converts E1 and E2 into type-1 membrane-anchored proteins. [19][48] Furthermore, E1 and E2 form non-covalently associated heterodimers, from hereon referred to as E1/E2. [8][19][37][41] Fully processed E1/E2 heterodimers are not exported to the cell surface, but are retained in the ER, where HCV budding occurs. [9][10][11][12][43] Analyses of E1 and E2 N-linked glycosylation patterns further showed that these proteins are retained in the ER without cycling through the Golgi. [12][34] The ER retention signals are located in the TM domains of E1 and E2. [6][7][14] Replacing the TM domains of E1 and E2 by the TM domains of plasma membrane-associated proteins, or mutating charged residues in the TM domains of E1 and E2, results in cell surface expression of the envelope glycoproteins. [6][7][8][14] Such TM domain modifications, however, also abrogate E1/E2 heterodimerization. [7][36] The dimerization and ER retention signals of E1 and E2 therefore cannot be dissociated. Deletion of the entire TM domain of E1 and E2 results in the secretion of soluble, monomeric ectodomains of the envelope glycoproteins. [12][13][35]</p>[0011] To date, two human cellular proteins, CD81 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, have been implicated as putative receptors that mediate HCV entry [25], and glycosaminoglycans have been suggested to pl",

The following morning, the blot is washed twice for 5 minutes in wash buffer [2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS] at room temperature, twice for 15 minutes in wash buffer at 63\u00b0 C., and once more in wash buffer at room temp. The blot is then washed once for 5 minutes in PBST [Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20]. The blot is then incubated with strepavidin-HRP (Amersham) at 1/1500 in PBST for 45 minutes at room temperature. The blot is washed twice quickly then three times for 15 minutes in PBST. The blot is developed using Western Lightening (NEN/Perkin Elmer) and Kodak film. An HCV RNA positive signal is exemplified by a specific band of 243 base pairs. The intensity of the 243 base pair band is compared in the presence and the absence of inhibitor, and a reduction in intensity indicates inhibition of HCV binding.  \nOligonameSequenceRJD-1 (KY80<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032-GCA GAA AGC GTC TAG CCA TGG CGT-3\u2032 RJD-5 (KY78<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032-CTC GCA AGC ACC CTA TCA GGC AGT-3\u2032 RJD-65\u2032\u2003biotin-GGA GAG CCA TAG TGG TCT GCG GAA C-3\u2032 RJD-7 (KY88<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032\u2003biotin-GTT GGG TCG CGA AAG GCC TTG TGG T-3\n</p>[0502] Third Set of Experiments </p>[0503] Summary </p>[0504] A novel, enhanced method for detecting HCV in samples from humans (blood, serum, plasma, tissue, amniotic fluid, et al) is disclosed that utilizes the assay described in the example vide infra. In this method, the samples are tested in the cell binding assay (SIGN assay) for attachment to HeLa cells expressing DC-SIGN and/or DC-SIGN-R. The standard cell-free assay is used as a control at varying dilutions of sample to determine the limit of detection and linearity of the SIGN assay. This test provides additional quantitative information on HCV viral load, (e.g., an increased sensitivity in detecting the presence of HCV in a biological sample), in addition to qualitative properties (DC-SIGN or DC-SIGN-R binding) on the virus present in the sample. This assay provides novel information relevant for receptor usage, the distribution of viral quasi-species (e.g., pathogenic phenotypes) and thus has utility in monitoring clinical disease progression. </p>[0505] Sample Binding to Cells </p>[0506] HeLa cell lines (HeLa-DC-SIGN, HeLa-DC-SIGN-R) or parental HeLa cells are cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 24-well plate at 1\u00d710<sup>5</sup>cells/well. The following day, the cells are washed once with adherence buffer and blocked with adherence buffer containing 10% heat-inactivated goat serum for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The cells are washed once with adherence buffer. A fixed volume (e.g., 10-1000 \u03bcL) of either HCV RNA+ (virus positive) or HCV RNA\u2212 serum (virus negative), or other samples (plasma, tissue extracts et al) is diluted in adherence buffer for a final volume of 200 \u03bcL, and a range of 10-fold serial dilutions is prepared. These suspensions are added to wells for 1 hour to enable interaction with virus an",

The intensity of the 243 base pair band is compared between identical samples in the cell binding (SIGN) assay, and the cell-free assay for quantitative and qualitative differences. The difference in signal intensities observed in the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGN-R assays provides information relevant to HCV receptor usage and tropism, and ultimately to clinical progression.  \nOligonameSequenceRJD-1 (KY80<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032-GCA GAA AGC GTC TAG CCA TGG CGT-3\u2032 RJD-5 (KY78<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032-CTC GCA AGC ACC CTA TCA GGC AGT-3\u2032 RJD-65\u2032\u2003biotin-GGA GAG CCA TAG TGG TCT GCG GAA C-3\u2032 RJD-7 (KY88<sup>1</sup>)5\u2032\u2003biotin-GTT GGG TCG CGA AAG GCC TTG TGG T-3\u2032\n</p>[0515] Numerous other embodiments of the above assay can be envisaged. For example, HCV captured onto Hela-DC-SIGN and/or HeLa-DC-SIGN-R cells can be quantitated using other conventional readouts, such as by Western blot analysis of HCV proteins using antibodies to viral proteins. In another embodiment, purified DC-SIGN and/or DC-SIGN-R proteins can be immobilized onto a surface, such as a plate or bead using conventional technologies, and used to capture and concentrate HCV from patient specimens. The amount of HCV can be quantified using by measuring the number of viral genomes by RT-PCR methods as described, by Western blot analysis of viral proteins, by ELISA, or by other standard methodologies that are well known to those skilled in the art. </p>[0516] Fourth Set of Experiments </p>[0517] Virus Binding Assay </p>[0518] Virus-cell binding HeLa cell lines were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 96-well plate at 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells/well. Cells were blocked with AB containing 10% heat-inactivated goat serum for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were washed once with AB, and mannan (20 \u03bcg/ml) added for 15 minutes in adherence buffer at room temperature. After washing, sera (10-20 \u03bcl) from HCV RNA+ (virus positive) or HCV RNA\u2212 serum (virus negative) donors (all HIV sero-negative) were diluted in AB, and allowed to bind to cells for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. with gentle agitation every 15 minutes, after which cells were washed five times with adherence buffer. </p>[0519] RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted from cells using a QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Spin kit (Qiagen) with modifications. Briefly, RNA was extracted with lysis buffer followed binding to spin columns and DNA removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). RNA was washed and eluted in elution buffer. </p>[0520] Southern blot HCV RNA was amplified by RT-PCR as described previously (Young, K. K., et al. 1993, J. Clin. Microbiol. 31, 882-886) with modifications. Primer KY78 (5\u2032-CTCGCAAGCACCCTATCAGGCAGT-3\u2032, 0.5 nmol) (nt276-299) was combined with 0.5 \u03bcL of extracted RNA in a final volume of 6 \u03bcL and preheated followed by addition of cDNA synthesis buffer, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 7.5 U of ThermoScript (Invitrogen), incubated at 58\u00b0 C. for 50 min then 85\u00b0 C. for 5 min bef",

An HCV RNA positive signal is exemplified by a specific band of 243 base pairs. </p>[0522] Real-time PCR HCV Quantasure\u2122 Plus assay was utilized at Laboratory Corporation of America (Research Triangle Park, N.C.), and has been demonstrated to be sensitive, specific to HCV and has a linear dynamic range of 10 to 100,000,000 IU/ml in comparative studies to 228 Roche COBAS Amplicor assay (Turnmire, C., 2002 Clearwater Virology Symposium). Briefly, a 4 \u03bcl aliquot of extracted RNA was added to a one-step RT-PCR reaction mixture containing sense and anti-sense primers specific for HCV and a Taqman probe (proprietary sequences; LabCorp, Inc.). The cycle at which the amplification plot crosses the threshold was defined as the threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>), and was predictive of the number of HCV RNA copies in the sample. A standard curve was calculated for quantification using serial 10-fold dilutions of a reference HCV-positive sample. </p>[0523] Results </p>[0524] HCV Virus Binding to DC-SIGN-R and DC-SIGN </p>[0525] The ability of the SIGN molecules to bind HCV virions was compared. In the absence of a method for culturing HCV in vitro, a novel assay to measure the interaction of the SIGN molecules with HCV virions present in the sera of infected individuals was developed. There are no prior reports on the binding of naturally occurring viruses to either DC-SIGN-R or DC-SIGN. </p>[0526] In the virus-binding assay, HCV-positive or -negative sera were combined for one hour with HeLa cells expressing DC-SIGN-R, DC-SIGN or neither receptor. Following removal of unbound virus and RNA extraction, HCV genomes were detected by real-time PCR (Taqman) or by RT-PCR followed by qualitative Southern blot. </p>[0527] DC-SIGN-R transfectants specifically bound 3 of 3 HCV-positive sera as determined by Taqman analysis, whereas DC-SIGN mediated specific binding for 1 of 3 sera. The levels of virus binding to DC-SIGN-R ranged from 4- to 7-fold greater than the background levels observed for parental HeLa (FIGS. 7a, 7b). HCV binding to DC-SIGN-R was abrogated by more than 90% following mannan treatment (FIGS. 7c, 7d). Overall, there was a good concordance in results obtained in the hybridization and Taqman assays, although the latter was more quantitative and sensitive to detect the low levels of binding (FIG. 7). </p>[0528] During natural infection, HCV serum titers show significant inter- and intra-patient variation over time (Lauer, G. H., et. al. 2001, N. Engl. J. Med. 345, 41-52). To further investigate the breadth and robustness of HCV binding to DC-SIGN-R and DC-SIGN, the assay was repeated using sera from patients with higher viral loads. For these, both DC-SIGN-R and DC-SIGN mediated specific, mannan-inhibitable binding for 3 of 3 sera (FIG. 8), with the highest-titered sera exhibiting 129- and 58-fold enhanced binding to DC-SIGN-R and DC-SIGN cells, respectively.
