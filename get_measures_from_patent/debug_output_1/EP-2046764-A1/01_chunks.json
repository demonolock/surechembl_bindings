The reaction mixture was cooled to -5\u00b0C and benzene sulfonyl chloride (0.024 ml, 0.19 mmol) was added. After warming to room temperature and stirring for 4h, the reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was separated, washed with brine, dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give Benzenesulfonic acid 4-(5-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethyl-4,5-dihydro-isoxazol-3- yl)-phenyl ester (67 mg, 99% yield). 1H-NMR (acetone-d6): \u03b4 = 3.60 (d, 1H); 3.95 (d, 1H); 7.14 (d, 2H); 7.44 (s, 1H); 7.63-7.93 (m, 7H) ppm. \n\n BIOLOGICAL DATA HDAC6 assay</p>\n  HDAC6 inhibitory activity of compounds of the present invention was quantified employing the HDAC6 assay as described in the following paragraphs.</p>\n  Recombinant full-length human HDAC6 with C-terminal His-tag was expressed in Sf- 9 insect cells and purified using Nickel-NTA chromatography. The assay was performed using the HDAC-assay-kit purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). HDAC6 catalyzes the deacetylation of the FluordeLys substrate (purchased from Biomol #KI-104). This sensitizes the substrate to the developer which then generates a fluorophore. This fluorophore is excited with 360 nm light and the emitted light is detected on a fluorometric plate reader at 460 nm.</p>\n  HDAC6 was incubated for 90 min at 22<sup>0</sup>C in the presence of different concentrations of test compounds in 15 \u03bcl assay buffer [25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 0.04% NP40, 0.2% BSA, 22.5 \u03bcM Fluor de Lys substrate, 1% DMSO]. The concentration of HDAC6 was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical concentrations were in the range of 20 nM. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 \u03bcl of a Stop/ Developer solution [25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 :20 diluted 2Ox Developer solution (purchased from Biomol #KI-105), 1 \u03bcM Trichostatin A].</p>\n  The resulting mixture was incubated for 1 h at 22\u00b0 C to allow the developing reaction to proceed. Subsequently the amount of deacetylated substrate was evaluated on a fluorometric plate reader (e.g. Acquest, molecular Devices) by measurement of the emission at 460 nm after excitation with 360 nm light. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor = 0 % inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme = 100 % inhibition) and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an inhouse software.</p>\n  The compounds of the present invention display IC50 values in the above- mentioned HDAC6 assay of less than 100 mM. \n\n BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES</p>\n  1.
