M.: 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology of Antipsychotics and Mood Stabilizers. Cambridge University Press). 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors are potential targets in the treatment of anxiety (Barret, J. E. et al.: Psychopharmacol. 1993, 112:1; De Vry, J.: Psychopharmacol. 1995, 121:1). Indeed, a partial agonist of 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors has already been introduced for the treatment of anxiety (Fulton, B. et al.: CNS Drugs 1997, 7:68.) and some others are in clinical testing. Animal experiments also indicate that 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>agonists may be useful in the treatment of depression (De Vry, J. Psychopharmacol. 1995, 121:1, Koek, W. et al.: J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 287:266). It is thought, that 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>agonist properties of some known antipsychotics (Newman-Tancredi, A. et al.: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 355:245, Saller, C. F. et al: Psychopharmacol. 1993, 112:285, Jordan, S. et al.: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002, 441:137) greatly contributes to their beneficial actions in the treatment of bipolar depression or depressive syndrome of schizophrenia. </p> The present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof which have very high affinity to dopamine D<sub>3 </sub>receptors (IC-50 values are less than 2 nM) and\u2014simultaneously\u2014have high affinity to 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors (IC-50: 1-20 nM) and moderate affinity to D<sub>2 </sub>receptors (IC-50 values between 10 and 40 nM) always in such combination that the D<sub>3 </sub>affinity is 5 to 150 higher than the D<sub>2 </sub>and 3-20 fold higher than the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>affinity. The order of receptor binding potency of the compounds of formula (I) is typically the following: D<sub>3</sub>&gt;5-HT<sub>1A</sub>&gt;D<sub>2</sub>. </p> In a further aspect of the present invention it provides a method of treating conditions which require preferential modulation of dopamine D<sub>3</sub>, and/or D<sub>2 </sub>and/or serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors, for example psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, eating disorders (e.g. bulimia nervosa), attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders in children, depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism and drug abuse, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof. </p> The invention also provides the use of a compound of formu",
    " and 20 nM) and moderately potent ligands at dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>receptors (IC<sub>50 </sub>values are between 10 and 40 nM) showing 5 to 150 fold and 3 to 20 fold selectivity over D<sub>2 </sub>and 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors, respectively (selectivity: IC<sub>50 </sub>for D<sub>2 </sub>or 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>divided by IC<sub>50 </sub>for D<sub>3</sub>). Such association of the very high D<sub>3 </sub>affinity to the high 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>and moderate D<sub>2 </sub>affinity in this particular proportion allows to preserve the beneficial (e.g. antipsychotic) actions of a D<sub>2 </sub>antagonist while\u2014at the same time\u2014impedes (by the D<sub>3 </sub>and 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>effects) the appearance of the disadvantageous consequences of massive D<sub>2 </sub>receptor blockade like extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive disturbances. It is therefore anticipated that no or greatly diminished adverse effects related to D<sub>2 </sub>receptors will occur in the course of therapeutical application of compounds of the present invention. Furthermore, beside favourably modulating the dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>receptor-mediated functions action of the compounds of the present invention on dopamine D<sub>3 </sub>and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors will also result in additional therapeutically beneficial effects e.g. cognitive improvement, diminution of negative and depressive symptoms or anxiolysis. In addition, the compounds have slight or low affinity to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors (IC-50 higher than 40 nM for each compound) and thus have extremely high D<sub>3</sub>/alpha-1 selectivity (ranging from hundred-fold to several hundred-fold). From the low affinity of the compounds to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors the lack of cardiovascular side effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension) is anticipated. </p> With respect to the expected clinical application of the compounds of the present invention in addition to their receptor binding profile their in vivo efficacy is a crucial issue as well. Therefore, in vivo potency and efficacy of the compounds of formula (I) were studied in the apomorphine climbing assay, an animal screening test for antipsychotic activity. </p> 5. Inhibition of Apomorphine Induced Climbing </p> Male CD-1 mice weighing 20-25 g were injected orally (n=12) with the test compound or vehicle. Fifty minutes later the animals were placed into cylindrical cages with walls of vertical metal bars. After 10 minutes habituation the mice were treated with apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg sc.). Ten minutes after APO treatment each animal was observed for 15 minutes and scored for their climbing behaviour. Scores were summed for each individual and group means were calculated. Drug effect was expressed and plotted as percentage inhibition of the apomorphine induced behaviour. ED<sub>50 </sub>(50% inhibitory dose) values were determined by linear regression. </p> In vivo activity of selected compounds of the present invention is shown in Table 2. ED<sub>50 </sub>(mg"
