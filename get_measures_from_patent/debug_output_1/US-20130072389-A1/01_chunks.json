    "molecular profiling steps can be performed in any order. In some embodiments, not all of the molecular profiling steps are performed. As a non-limiting example, microarray analysis is not performed if the sample quality does not meet a threshold value, as described herein. In some embodiments, the biological material is mRNA and the quality control test comprises a A260/A280 ratio and/or a Ct value of RT-PCR using a housekeeping gene, e.g., RPL13a. In embodiments, the mRNA does not pass the quality control test if the A260/A280 ratio &lt;1.5 or the RPL13a Ct value is &gt;30. In that case, microarray analysis may not be performed. Alternately, microarray results may be attenuated, e.g., given a lower priority as compared to the results of other molecular profiling techniques.</p>In some embodiments, molecular profiling is always performed on certain genes or gene products, whereas the profiling of other genes or gene products is optional. For example, IHC expression profiling may be performed on at least SPARC, TOP2A and/or PTEN. Similarly, microarray expression profiling may be performed on at least CD52. In other embodiments, genes in addition to those listed above are used to identify a treatment. For example, the group of genes used for the IHC expression profiling can further comprise DCK, EGFR, BRCA1, CK 14, CK 17, CK 5/6, E-Cadherin, p95, PARP-1, SPARC and TLE3. In some embodiments, the group of genes used for the IHC expression profiling further comprises Cox-2 and/or Ki-67. In some embodiments, HSPCA is assayed by microarray analysis. In some embodiments, FISH mutation is performed on c-Myc and TOP2A. In some embodiments, sequencing is performed on PI3K.</p>The methods of the invention can be used in any setting wherein differential expression or mutation analysis have been linked to efficacy of various treatments. In some embodiments, the methods are used to identify candidate treatments for a subject having a cancer. Under these conditions, the sample used for molecular profiling preferably comprises cancer cells. The percentage of cancer in a sample can be determined by methods known to those of skill in the art, e.g., using pathology techniques. Cancer cells can also be enriched from a sample, e.g., using microdissection techniques or the like. A sample may be required to have a certain threshold of cancer cells before it is used for molecular profiling. The threshold can be at least about 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 95% cancer cells. The threshold can depend on the analysis method. For example, a technique that reveals expression in individual cells may require a lower threshold that a technique that used a sample extracted from a mixture of different cells. In some embodiments, the diseased sample is compared to a normal sample taken from the same patient, e.g., adjacent but non-cancer tissue.</p>In embodiments, the methods of the invention are used detect gene fusions, such as those listed in International PCT Patent A",
    "fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues after macrodissection of the fixed slides in an area that % tumor nuclei \u226710% as determined by a pathologist. Extracted DNA is only used for mutation analysis if % tumor nuclei \u226710%. DNA is extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.). DNA can also be extracted using the QuickExtract\u2122 FFPE DNA Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wis.). The BRAF Mutector I BRAF Kit (TrimGen, cat#MH1001-04) is used to detect BRAF mutations (TrimGen Corporation, Sparks, Md.). The DxS KRAS Mutation Test Kit (DxS, #KR-03) is used to detect KRAS mutations (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.). BRAF and KRAS sequencing of amplified DNA is performed using Applied Biosystems' BigDye\u00ae Terminator V1.1 chemistry (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.).</p>IHC is performed according to standard protocols. IHC detection systems vary by marker and include Dako's Autostainer Plus (Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, Calif.), Ventana Medical Systems Benchmark\u00ae XT (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz.), and the Leica/Vision Biosystems Bond System (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, Ill.). All systems are operated according to the manufacturers' instructions. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologist (CAP) standards are followed for ER, PR, and HER2 testing. ER, PR and HER2 as well as Ki-67, p53, and E-cad IHCs analyzed by the ACIS\u00ae (Automated Cellular Imaging System). The ACIS system comprises a microscope that scans the slides and constructs an image of the entire tissue section. Ten areas of tumor are analyzed for percentage positive cells and staining intensity within the selected fields.</p>FISH is performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. FFPE tissue slides for FISH must be Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained and given to a pathologist for evaluation. Pathologists will mark areas of tumor for FISH analysis. The pathologist report shows whether tumor is present and sufficient enough to perform a complete analysis. FISH is performed using the Abbott Molecular VP2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, Iowa).</p>An illustrative report generated by the system in shown in FIGS. 16A-16N. FIG. 16A shows that the patient had a primary tumor in the breast determined to be HER2+, and provides a Summary of candidate therapeutic agents associated with beneficial or not for treating the tumor based on molecular profiling results. FIG. 16B illustrates a more detailed Summary listing for each agent associated with benefit, including the informative biomarkers and experimental methods used to assess those biomarkers.
