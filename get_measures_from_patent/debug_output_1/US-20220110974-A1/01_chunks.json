    "ample\u201d in that it is obtained directly from a subject; in some embodiments, a \u201csample\u201d is the result of processing of a primary sample, for example to remove certain components and/or to isolate or purify certain components of interest.</p>The term \u201csubject\u201d includes animals, such as e.g. mammals. In some embodiments, the mammal is a primate. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human. In some embodiments, subjects are livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, cows, swine, and the like; or domesticated animals such as dogs and cats. In some embodiments (e.g., particularly in research contexts) subjects are rodents (e.g., mice, rats, hamsters), rabbits, primates, or swine such as inbred pigs and the like. The terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpatient\u201d are used interchangeably herein.</p>\u201cAdministration\u201d refers herein to introducing an agent or composition into a subject.</p>\u201cTreating\u201d as used herein refers to delivering an agent or composition to a subject to affect a physiologic outcome.</p>As used herein, the term \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to the minimum amount of an agent or composition required to result in a particular physiological effect. The effective amount of a particular agent may be represented in a variety of ways based on the nature of the agent, such as mass/volume, # of cells/volume, particles/volume, (mass of the agent)/(mass of the subject), # of cells/(mass of subject), or particles/(mass of subject). The effective amount of a particular agent may also be expressed as the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), which refers to the concentration of an agent that results in a magnitude of a particular physiological response that is half-way between a reference level and a maximum response level.</p>\u201cPopulation\u201d of cells refers to any number of cells greater than 1, but is preferably at least 1\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells, at least at least 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>7 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>9 </sup>cells, at least 1\u00d710<sup>10 </sup>cells, or more cells. A population of cells may refer to an in vitro population (e.g., a population of cells in culture) or an in vivo population (e.g., a population of cells residing in a particular tissue).</p>General methods in molecular and cellular biochemistry can be found in such standard textbooks as Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed.
