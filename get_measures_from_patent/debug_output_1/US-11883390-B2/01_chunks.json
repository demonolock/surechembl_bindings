In some embodiments, this is due to a lower concentration of the reactive species (e.g., \u2014OD) in the D<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system compared to the concentration of the reactive species (e.g., \u2014OH) in an equivalent H<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system. In some instances, the concentration of the reactive species (e.g., \u2014OD) in the D<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system is about one third less than the concentration of the reactive species (e.g., \u2014OH) in the equivalent H<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system. In some cases, this is due to a lower or smaller dissociation constant of D<sub>2</sub>O than H<sub>2</sub>O. For example, the K<sub>a</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O) is 1\u00d710<sup>\u221214</sup>, whereas the K<sub>a</sub>(D<sub>2</sub>O) is 1\u00d710<sup>\u221215</sup>. As such, D<sub>2</sub>O is a weaker acid than H<sub>2</sub>O. In some cases, base catalyzed hydrolysis leads to the presence of tropine degradant from atropine. In some cases, with a lower concentration of the reactive species that causes tropine degradant formation, atropine solution is more stable in a D<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system than compared to an equivalent H<sub>2</sub>O aqueous system. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition formulated with deuterated water allows fora more stable ophthalmic composition relative to the ophthalmic composition formulated with H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\">In some embodiments, the presence of deuterated water shifts the pKa of the buffer. In some embodiments, the presence of deuterated water allows for the ophthalmic composition to simulate the stability of a lower pH system. In some instances, the buffer capacity of the ophthalmic composition is lowered, thereby allowing a faster shift in pH. In some instances, the lowered buffering capacity of the ophthalmic composition when administered into the eye allows the ophthalmic composition to reach physiological pH at a faster rate than compared to an ophthalmic composition formulated in H<sub>2</sub>O.
