Cell lysates containing Flag epitope-tagged JNK are incubated with GST-JIP-1 (residues 127-281) bound to glutathione-Sepharose, either with or without synthetic peptides (0, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 \u03bcg/ml) , for one hour at 4\u00b0C.\nA standard dosage would be from 1 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg of body weight.\nA standard dosage of polypeptide also would be from 1 to 1000, e.g., 10 to 500, or 20 to 200 \u03bcg/kg of body weight."}
