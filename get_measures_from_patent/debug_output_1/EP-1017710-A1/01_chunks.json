    " The absence of co-immunoprecipitation of JIP-1 with these MAP kinases demonstrates that JIP-1 forms a specific complex with</p>JNK.</p>This same assay can be used to determine whether a specific polypeptide is a JIP-1 polypeptide. \n\nExample 3: JIP-1 Interacts Directly with JNK</p>To test whether JIP-1 interacts directly with JNK, in vi tro binding assays were performed. The putative JNK binding domain (JBD; amino acid residues 127-281 of JIP- 1) , defined by the clones obtained in the two-hybrid screen, was expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. GST- fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose as described previously. Smith et al . , Gene, .67:31 (1988). Recombinant JNK, prepared by in vi tro translation in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine (Derijard et al . , supra ; Sluss et al . , supra ; Gupta et al . , supra) , was incubated with GST-JIP-1 immobilized on GSH-agarose. Control experiments revealed no detectable binding of JNK isoforms to GST alone. In contrast, in assays using GST- JNK fusion proteins representing ten different human JNK isoforms, each of these proteins exhibited similar amounts of binding to JIP-1. JIP-1 therefore interacts with multiple JNK isoforms. Previous studies have demonstrated that JNK binds to the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2 , and that the binding of JNK to these transcription factors is isoform- dependent . To test whether JIP-1 binding to JNK is also isoform-dependent , a binding assay was utilized. Cell lysates (1 ml in TLB) containing JNKl, JNK2 , or p38 MAP kinase, each tagged with the Flag epitope, were incubated with 5 \u03bcg GST-fusion proteins pre-bound to 10 \u03bcl glutathione-Sepharose . The GST fusion proteins used contain residues 127-202 (SEQ ID NO: 15), 203-281 (SEQ ID NO: 16), 164-240 (SEQ ID N0:17), or 127-281 (SEQ ID N0:4) of JIP-1. The GST-ATF2 fusion protein contains residues 1-109 of ATF2, and the GST-Jun fusion protein contains residues 1-79 of c-Jun. After incubation for one hour at 4\u00b0C and three washes with TLB, bound proteins were detected by protein immunoblot analysis with the M2 \n\nmonoclonal antibody, which is specific for the Flag epitope. Derijard, et al . , supra; Sluss et al . , supra; Gupta et al . , supra . When ATF2 or c-jun GST fusion proteins were used in this assay, binding to JNKl was greater than binding to JNK2. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies. In contrast, when GST-JIP-1 fusion proteins containing residues 127-202 or 127-281 of JIP-1 were tested in the assay, these proteins bound both JNKl and JNK2. The level of binding of these fusion proteins to JNKl was similar to the level of binding to JNK2. The binding of JNK to JIP-1 was significantly greater than the binding of JNK to ATF2 or c-Jun. Control experiments demonstrated that JIP-1 did not bind to p38 MAP kinase. These data establish that JIP-1 binding to JNKl is quantitatively similar to JIP-1 binding to JNK2 , and that JNK bin",
    "1 inhibits JNK \n\nsignaling, these results indicate that the JNK pathway is required for pre-B cell transformation by BCR-ABL.</p>The demonstration that JNK is involved in both apoptosis and oncogenic transformation indicates that the biological actions of the JNK signal transduction pathway depend on the specific cellular context. The integration of JNK with other signal transduction pathways may be an important determinant of the functional consequences of JNK activation. The ability of JIP-1, an inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway, to block both transformation and apoptosis is consistent with this hypothesis .</p>The physiological function of JIP-1 may be to suppress signal transduction by the JNK pathway. For example, JIP-1 may compete with substrates that bind JNK. Alternatively, JIP-1 may have a more direct role in targeting JNK to specific regions of the cell or to specific substrates. Since JIP-1 causes redistribution of JNK within the cell, JIP-1 may function as a cytoplasmic anchor for JNK. The tethering of JNK in the cytoplasm by interactions with JIP-1 provides a mechanism for controlling signal transduction by the JNK pathway, and the related phenomena of apoptosis and transformation. This assay can be used to determine if specific polypeptides have the same effect on cellular transformation as full length, wildtype JIP-1.</p>Example 10: Screening for Peptides with JIP-1 Activity</p>Peptides suspected of having JIP-1 activity can be tested in the JNK binding assay described supra .</p>Peptides are synthesized by methods that are well known to those skilled in the art; for example, using an Applied Biosystems synthesizer. Cell lysates containing Flag epitope-tagged JNK are incubated with GST-JIP-1 \n\n(residues 127-281) bound to glutathione-Sepharose, either with or without synthetic peptides (0, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 \u03bcg/ml) , for one hour at 4\u00b0C. The beads are washed in TLB, and the bound proteins are detected by protein immunoblot analysis with a Flag-specific antibody, e.g., M2. Synthetic peptides with JIP-1 activity are those which inhibit the interaction of JIP-1 with JNK, as detected in this assay. These synthetic peptides should possess at least 60% of the binding activity of JIP-1.</p>Example 11: Therapeutic Applications</p>JIP-1 is shown herein to be capable of inhibiting apoptosis and transformation. Compositions containing JIP-1 polypeptides or nucleic acids can be administered to treat conditions characterized by these phenomena. Nucleic acids can be administered by, methods described in, e.g., Ausubel, et al . , supra . A standard dosage would be from 1 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg of body weight. Polypeptides, peptides and peptide mimetics of the invention can be formulated according to procedures which are well known to those skilled in the art. A standard dosage of polypeptide also would be from 1 to 1000, e.g., 10 to 500, or 20 to 200 \u03bcg/kg of body weight.</p>Animal models for testing the effect of JIP-1 therapeutic compositi"
