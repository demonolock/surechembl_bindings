The solution was stirred and warmed to 60\u00b0 under an argon flow for 2-3h. The reaction solution colour changed from orange to yellowish to a greenish colour during the course of the reaction. On cooling to room temperature the solution was filtered and then treated with 200mL dry ether (about half the 1,2-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was expelled with the HCI during the course of the reaction by the argon stream). The product was collected, washed well with water and ether and air dried. Yield 8.5g. This was dissolved in ca. 55mL acetone, filtered, and the yellow solution was treated with toluene until cloudy. 7g of yellow crystals of \u03b1-[(n-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>4</sub>[(\u03b7<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>s</sub>)TiPW<sub>11</sub>O<sub>39</sub>] were obtained. </p>6.4g of this tetra-n-butylammonium salt was dissolved in 100mL 1,2-CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and a saturated aqueous solution of KI (10g) was added. CHCl<sub>3</sub> was then added to the stirred mixture until the upper layer was nearly colourless. The organic layer was removed and the aqueous solution (ca. 6mL) together with some organics was centrifuged. Some solids had separated and therefore the aqueous solution was diluted to 15mL, filtered and placed in a vacuum dessicator over P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. After the solution had concentrated to ca. 10mL, orange crystals formed which were collected when the solution volume was ca. 5mL.

In many of the compounds substituted cyclopentadienyl groups were incorporated and these compounds were designed for use as labels for biological compounds in transmission electron microscopy.
