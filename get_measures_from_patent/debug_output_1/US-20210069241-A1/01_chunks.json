    "tion or union of a binding protein (e.g., CAR or TCR) or a binding component (or fusion protein thereof) to a target molecule with an affinity or K<sub>a </sub>(i.e., an equilibrium association constant of a particular binding interaction with units of 1/M) equal to or greater than 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>(which equals the ratio of the on-rate [k<sub>on</sub>] to the off-rate [k<sub>off</sub>] for this association reaction), while not significantly associating or uniting with any other molecules or components in a sample. Binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof) may be classified as \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof) or as \u201clow affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof). \u201cHigh affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains refer to those binding proteins or binding domains having a K<sub>a </sub>of at least 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>11 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>12 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or at least 10<sup>13 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. \u201cLow affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains refer to those binding proteins or binding domains having a K<sub>a </sub>of up to 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, up to 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, up to 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Alternatively, affinity may be defined as an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of a particular binding interaction with units of M (e.g., 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>In certain embodiments, a receptor or binding domain may have \u201cenhanced affinity,\u201d which refers to selected or engineered receptors or binding domains with stronger binding to a target antigen than a wild type (or parent) binding domain. For example, enhanced affinity may be due to a K<sub>a </sub>(equilibrium association constant) for the target antigen that is higher than the wild type binding domain, due to a K<sub>d </sub>(dissociation constant) for the target antigen that is less than that of the wild type binding domain, due to an off-rate (k<sub>off</sub>) for the target antigen that is less than that of the wild type binding domain, or a combination thereof.</p>In certain embodiments, a binding protein of this disclosure may be codon optimized to enhance expression in a particular host cell, such as T cells (Scholten et al., Clin. Immunol. 119:135, 2006).</p>A variety of assays can be used to identify binding domains of the present disclosure that specifically bind a particular target, as well as determining binding domain or fusion protein affinities, such as Western blot, ELISA, analytical ultracentrifugation, spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (Biacore\u00ae) analysis (see, e.g., Scatchard et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660, 1949; Wilson, Science 295:2103, 2002; Wolff et al., Cancer Res. 53:2560, 1993; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,173, 5,468,614, or the equivalent). In some examples, apparent K<sub>D </sub>of a TCR is measured using 2-fold dilutions of labeled tetramers at a range of concentrations, followed by determination of binding curves by non-linear regression, apparent K<sub>D </sub>being determined as the concentration of ligand that yielded half-maximal binding.</p>Antigen-specific receptors expressed by modified immune cells according to the present disclosure specifically bind to antigens that are associated with, for example, solid tumors. Solid tumors are typically associat"
