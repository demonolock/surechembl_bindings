    "ne skilled in the art (US 20090311253).</p>The term \u201csurface plasmon resonance\u201d means an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore\u00ae system (BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see J\u00f6nsson et al. (1993) Ann. Biol. Clin. 51:19-26. The term \u201cK<sub>on</sub>\u201d means the on rate constant for association of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-Ig) to the antigen to form the, e.g., DVD-Ig/antigen complex. The term \u201cK<sub>on</sub>\u201d also means \u201cassociation rate constant\u201d, or \u201cka\u201d, as is used interchangeably herein. This value indicating the binding rate of a binding protein to its target antigen or the rate of complex formation between a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, and antigen also is shown by the equation below:</p>Antibody (\u201cAb\u201d)+Antigen (\u201cAg\u201d)\u2192Ab\u2212Ag\n</p>The term \u201cK<sub>off</sub>\u201d means the off rate constant for dissociation, or \u201cdissociation rate constant\u201d, of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-Ig) from the, e.g., DVD-Ig/antigen complex as is known in the art. This value indicates the dissociation rate of a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, from its target antigen or separation of Ab-Ag complex over time into free antibody and antigen as shown by the equation below:</p>Ab+Ag\u2190Ab\u2212Ag\n</p>The terms \u201cK<sub>d</sub>\u201d and \u201cequilibrium dissociation constant\u201d means the value obtained in a titration measurement at equilibrium, or by dividing the dissociation rate constant (K<sub>off</sub>) by the association rate constant (K<sub>on</sub>). The association rate constant, the dissociation rate constant and the equilibrium dissociation constant, are used to represent the binding affinity of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-Ig) to an antigen. Methods for determining association and dissociation rate constants are well known in the art. Using fluorescence\u2014based techniques offers high sensitivity and the ability to examine samples in physiological buffers at equilibrium. Other experimental approaches and instruments such as a BIAcore\u00ae (biomolecular interaction analysis) assay, can be used (e.g., instrument available from BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, a KinExA\u00ae (Kinetic Exclusion Assay) assay, available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, Id.), can also be used.</p>The term \u201cvariant\u201d means a polypeptide that differs from a given polypeptide in amino acid sequence by the addition (e.g., insertion), deletion, or conservative substitution of amino acids, but that retains the biological activity of the given polypeptide (e.g., a variant IL-17 antibody can compete with anti-IL-17 antibody for binding to IL-17). A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity and degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes can be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art (see, e.g., Kyte et al. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157: 105",
    "ioassay and Neutralization AssayMRC5 cells were plated at 1.5-2\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in a 100 \u03bcl volume and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A 20 \u03bcg/ml working stock of antibody (4\u00d7 concentrated) was prepared in complete MEM medium. An eight point serial dilution was performed (5 \u03bcg/ml-0.0003 \u03bcg/ml) in complete MEM in Marsh dilution plates. Seventy-five \u03bcl/well of each antibody dilution was added in quadruplicate to a 96 well v-bottom (Costar #3894) plate and 75 \u03bcl of a 200 pg/ml solution of IL-1\u03b2. Control wells received 75 \u03bcl 200 pg/ml of IL-1\u03b2 (4\u00d7 concentrated) plus 75 \u03bcl MEM media and media control wells received 150 \u03bcl of media. Following a 1 hour incubation, 100 \u03bcl of the Ab/Ag mixture was added to the MRC5 cells. All well volumes were equal to 200 \u03bcl. All plate reagents were then 1\u00d7 concentrated. After a 16-20 hour incubation, the well contents (150 \u03bcl) were transferred into a 96-well round bottom plate (Costar #3799) and placed in a \u221220\u00b0 C. freezer. The supernatants were tested for hIL-8 levels by using a human IL-8 ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or hIL-8 chemiluminescence kit (MDS). Neutralization potency was determined by calculating percent inhibition relative to the IL-1\u03b2 alone control value.

The IL-17-induced IL-6 secretion is inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibodies (See, e.g., J. Imm. 155:5483-5486 (1995) or Cytokine 9:794-800 (1997)).</p>HS27 cells were maintained in assay medium (DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco #11965) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco #26140), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin G (100 U/500 ml) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/500 ml)). Cells were grown in T150 flasks until they were about 80-90% confluent the day of the assay. Human IL-17 (R&amp;D Systems, #317-IL/CF) was reconstituted in sterile PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, stored frozen, freshly thawed for use and diluted to 40 ng/ml (4\u00d7) in assay medium. Serial dilutions of antibodies were made in a separate plate (4\u00d7 concentrations), mixed with an equal volume of 40 ng/ml (4\u00d7) of human IL-17 and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. HS27 cells (typically about 20,000 cells in 50 \u03bcl assay medium) were added to each well of a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Costar #3599), followed by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of the pre-incubated antibody or DVD-Ig protein plus IL-17 mix. The final concentration of IL-17 was 10 ng/ml. Cells were incubated for about 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The media supernatants were then collected. The level of IL-17 neutralization was measured by determination of IL-6 amounts in supernatant using a commercial Meso Scale Discovery kit according to manufacturer's instructions. IC50 values were obtained using logarithm of antibody or DVD-Ig protein vs. IL-6 amount variable slope fit.</p>TABLE 4IL-17 Neutralization Assay With IL-17Parent Antibody and DVD-Ig ProteinC-TerminalParentN-TerminalC-TerminalVD IL17Antibody orVariableVariableNeutralizationDVD-Ig IDDomain (VD)Domain (VD)Assay (IC50 nM)AB273IL-17 (seq 1)0.031AB420IL-17 (seq 2)0.048AB461IL-17 (seq 3)DVD2423IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 2)1.092DVD2424IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 2)0.077DVD2425IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 2)0.221DVD2426IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 2)0.071DVD2427IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 2)0.771DVD2428IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 2)0.065DVD2429IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 2)0.305DVD2430IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 2)0.056DVD2431IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 2)0.805DVD2432IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 2)0.079DVD2433IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 2)0.125DVD2434IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 2)0.055DVD2435IL-1b (seq 4)IL-17 (seq 2)0.863DVD2436IL-1b (seq 4)IL-17 (seq 2)0.042DVD2437IL-1b (seq 4)IL-17 (seq 2)0.12DVD2438IL-1b (seq 4)IL-17 (seq 2)0.032DVD2439IL-1b (seq 5)IL-17 (seq 2)0.549DVD2440IL-1b (seq 5)IL-17 (seq 2)0.055DVD2441IL-1b (seq 5)IL-17 (seq 2)0.087DVD2442IL-1b (seq 5)IL-17 (seq 2)0.043DVD3415IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 2)0.091DVD3416IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 3)0.16DVD3417IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 3)0.37DVD3418IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 3)0.068DVD3419IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 3)1.7DVD3420IL-1b (seq 1)IL-17 (seq 3)0.36DVD3422IL-1b (seq 2)IL-17 (seq 3)0.063DVD3423IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 3)0.05DVD3425IL-1b (seq 3)IL-17 (seq 3)0.098</p>All DVD-Ig proteins containing VDs from AB273, AB420 or AB461 in either the N-terminal or C-terminal position showed neutralization in the HS27 IL-17 neutralization assay.</p>Example 2.3 Affinity Determination Using BIACORE TechnologyTABLE 5Reagents Used in Biacore AnalysesAntigenVendor DesignationVendorCatalog #IL-17Recombinan"
