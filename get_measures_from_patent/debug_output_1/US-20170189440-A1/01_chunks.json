    "ications, such as blindness, kidney failure, impotence, atherosclerosis, and increased vulnerability to infection.</p>In a healthy subject, pancreatic tissue is responsible for secretion of hormones that regulate serum glucose homeostasis. After a meal, when blood glucose levels rise, secretion of insulin lowers blood sugar by stimulating tissue glucose uptake (the primary tissue responsible being skeletal muscle). Conversely, when serum glucose levels fall, secretion of glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose into the blood stream.</p>Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly common disorder around the world, characterized by chronically elevated serum glucose levels. Classically, diabetes segregates into two distinct groups that require alternative therapeutic approaches. Type 1 diabetes, is primarily caused by an inability of the subject to produce sufficient insulin to regulate blood sugar. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is characterized by a reduced ability to respond to serum insulin, a state know as insulin resistance. Treatment of both types of diabetes can involve the administration of insulin, however, frequent insulin injections are both expensive and burdensome, involving the need for constant blood sugar assessment to regulate and time insulin dosing.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONEmbodiments of the instant invention as based on the finding that log-term activation of beta cells results in a feedback response mediated by the Protein Kinase Inhibitor (PKI) pathway, which prevents further activation of the beta cells. Without being bound by any particular mechanism, it is proposed that the prolonged activation of beta cells results in an effective de-differentiation of the cells thereby rendering them significantly less effective regulating glucose homeostasis. Methods provided herein may allow for \u201creactivation\u201d (or prevention of deactivation) of beta cells by the use to inhibitors of the PKI pathway. Thus, in some aspects, inhibitors of the PKI pathway may be used to sensitize a subject to treatment with a conventional therapeutic for insulin resistance such as GLP1 agonists.</p>In a first embodiment there is provided a method of treating a subject having insulin resistance comprising administering an effective amount of an inhibitor of the PKI pathway to the subject having insulin resistance. For instance, in some aspects, the inhibitor of the PKI pathway is an inhibitor of the PKIA, PKIB or PKIG pathway. In certain aspects the inhibitor of the PKIB pathway is an inhibitor of PIKB (e.g., an inhibitor nucleic acid, which reduced expression of PKIB), a HIF1 inhibitor or a mTOR inhibitor. In still further aspects, a subject for treatment according the embodiments is a subject who has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, such as a subject with type 2 diabetes who is resistant to the a Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) agonist therapy.</p>Thus, in a further embodiment, there is provided method for treating a subject having insulin resistance comprising administering an effective amount of a PKI pathway inhibitor to a subject who has been determined to be resistant to a GLP1 agonist therapy. For instance, in some aspects, the inhibitor of the PKI pathway is an inhibitor of the PKIA, PKIB, or PKIG pathway. In further aspects, the PKI pathway inhibitor is a PKIB pathway inhibitor selected from the group consisting of an inhibitor of PKIB, a mTOR inhibitor and a HIF1 inhibitor.</p>In still further aspects, a method of the embodiments comprises administering a GLP1 agonist to the patient in conjunction with the PKI pathway inhibitor (e.g., a PKIA, PKIB or PKIG pathway inhibitor). For example, a PKI pathway inhibitor may be administered before, after or essentially simultaneously with the GLP1 agonist. A skilled artisan will recognize that, in some aspects, certain PKI pathways inhibitors (e.g., HIF1 inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors) operate in opposition to the acute effects of GLP1 agonists. Accordingly, in preferred aspects, PKI pathway inhibitors are administered prior to treatment with a GLP1 agonist. For example, in a subject identified as resistant to GLP1 agonist therapy, the subject may be administered one, two, three or more doses of a PKI pathways inhibitor (e.g., over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more days) prior administering (or resuming administration) of a GLP1 agonist therapy. Thus, in some aspects, a subject resistant to GLP1 agonist therapy is alternatively administered a PKI pathway inhibitor of the embodiments and a GLP1 agonist. For example, a subject may be administered a GLP1 agonist over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, weeks or more and then the therapy replaced with a period of treatment with a PKI pathway inhibitor for a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days or more before resuming GLP1 agonist therapy. For course, in some aspects, a subject undergoing treatment according to the embodiments may be administered one or more secondary treatment along with a GLP1 agonist and/or PKI pathways inhibitor therapy (e.g., the subject may be treated with a insulin, such as along-acting insulin (insulin glargine; Lantus\u00ae).</p>Certain aspects of the embodiments concern treatment of subject who are resistant to a GLP1 agonist therapy. As used herein a \u201cGLP1 agonist therapy\u201d refers both treatment with a GLP1 agonist per se (e.g., Exenatide (Byetta\u00ae), Liraglutide, Taspoglutide, Albiglutide or Lixisenatide) and to treatments that induce production of endogenous GLP1 agonists such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., Sitagliptin (Januvia), Vildagliptin (Galvus), Saxagliptin (Onglyza), Linagliptin, Anagliptin, Teneligliptin, Alogliptin, Gemigliptin or Dutogliptin). Thus, as used herein, a subject who is \u201cresistant to a GLP1 agonist therapy\u201d refers to a subject who exhibits insignificant reductions in blood glucose (or reductions in blood glucose that not sufficient to control disease) in response to a GLP1 agonist therapy. In some aspects, a subject who is resistant to GLP1 agonist therapy is a subject who has developed GLP1 agonist resistance, such as a subject who is being treated with a GLP1 agonist therapy, but who exhibits decreasing response to the therapy over time.</p>As further detailed herein, some aspects of the embodiments concern administering a PKI pathway inhibitor to a subject in conjunction with a GLP1 agonist (or a DPP-4 inhibitor). Again as used here a \u201cGLP1 agonist\u201d refers both to agonist molecules per se (including molecules having combined GLP1 and GIP agonist activity) as well as molecules that increase endogenous incretin, such as DPP-4 inhibitors. Thus, in some aspects, a GLP1 agonist for use according to the embodiments can comprise exenatide, bydureon, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide or lixisenatide. In some aspects, the GLP1 agonist is exenatide. In further aspects, a PKI pathway inhibitor is administered in conjunction with a DPP-4 inhibitor such as sitagliptin (MK-0431), vildagliptin (LAF237), saxagliptin, linagliptin, dutogliptin, gemigliptin, berberine, and alogliptin. Further GLP1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors for use according to the embodiments are detailed herein below.</p>Further aspects of the embodiments concern administration of PKI inhibitors to a subject. For example, in some aspects, the PKI inhibitor is an inhibitor of PKIB.

In certain preferred aspects the inhibitory nucleic acid is an RNA such as a dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA or shRNA. In still further aspects, a PKI inhibitor for use according to the embodiments is an inhibitor of PKIA. For example, an inhibitor of PKIA can be an inhibitory nucleic acid, such as a nucleic acid that is complimentary to all of part of a PKIA mRNA (e.g., as provided in SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 11). In certain preferred aspects the inhibitory nucleic acid is an RNA such as a dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA or shRNA.

In certain preferred aspects the inhibitory nucleic acid is an RNA such as a dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA or shRNA.</p>Yet further aspects of the embodiments concern PKI pathway inhibitors such as mTOR inhibitors. For example, in preferended aspects, the mTOR inhibitor is a small molecule mTOR inhibitor such as sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus, zotarolimus, tacrolimus, SAR543, ascomycin, deferolimus, AP23841, KU-0063794, INK-128, EX2044, EX3855, EX7518, AZD08055, OSI-027, WYE-125132, XL765, NV-128, WYE-125132 or EM101/LY303511. In further preferred aspects the mTOR inhibitor is a rapamycin or rapamycin derivative, in particular sirolimus or everolimus rapamycin. Further mTOR inhibitors for use according to the embodiments are detailed herein below.</p>Still further aspects of the embodiments concern PKI pathway inhibitors, which are HIF1 inhibitors. For example, in some aspects the HIF1 inhibitor comprises FG-4592, IOX2, 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2), CL67, CAY10585 (CAS 934593-90-5), sc-205346 (CAS 934593-90-5), Chetomin (CAS 1403-36-7) or Chrysin (CAS 480-40-0). Further HIF1 inhibitors for use according to the embodiments are detailed herein below.</p>In preferred aspects, a subject of the embodiments is a human subject. In some aspects, a subject having insulin resistance according to the embodiments is subject diagnosed with a metabolic disease selected from the group consisting of type 2 diabetes; metabolic syndrome; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; and/or polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>In a further embodiment there is provided a method for treating a cancer, such as a cancer associated with diabetes, comprising administering an effective amount of an inhibitor of PKIB. For example, in some aspects the diabetes associated cancer is liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, endometrial cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

As used here \u201cat risk\u201d subjects can include but is not limited to obese subjects or aged individuals. Furthermore, at risk subjects may have chronic elevated blood insulin, triglycerides or glucose levels and/or have high blood pressure.</p>Methods according to the embodiments may also be used in combination with other therapeutic strategies that are known to those of skill in the art. For example, in certain aspects, methods may be used in combination with insulin administration. In this case, such methods may reduce the amount of insulin that must administered and/or the frequency at which the insulin is administered. Other compounds that are known in the art to be effective for regulating glucose homeostasis include sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, motformin and repaglinide. Thus, methods of the embodiments may additionally comprise, administering a sulfonylurea, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, motformin, or repaglinide to a subject. Combination treatment may be particularly preferred as they can reduce the effective concentrations of each therapeutic compound used and thus limit undesirable side effects of the compounds.</p>In still further embodiments of the present invention relate to a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a GLP1 agonist (DPP-4 inhibitor) and PKI pathway inhibitor.

    "II diabetes mellitus is an increasingly common disorder around the world. However, despite extensive study the development of a wide range of therapeutics adequate control of the disease has proved to be challenging. GLP1 agonist based therapies such as Byetta\u00ae (exenatide), for example, while promising have provided to be ineffective in certain type II diabetes patients. Thus, there remains a significant need for new therapeutic approaches to treat insulin resistance.</p>Studies presented herein address an important and unrecognized underlying mechanism of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. It was demonstrated that the induction of a compensatory growth pathway in response to nutrient stress impairs cell function by blocking the expression of a genetic program required for cellular maturation. In the short term, GLP1 and glucose promote the adaptive expansion of pancreatic islet mass through CREB mediated increases in mTORC1 activity that culminate in the induction of the HIF pathway (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Publn. 20130143800, incorporated herein by reference). Importantly, however, when stimulation is prolonged HIF1 feeds back to inhibit CREB activity by stimulating the expression of PKIB and thereby blocking the activation of PKA in response to GLP1. Thus, while initially HIF1 and mTOR are involved in GLP1-mediated beta cell activation, after prolonged activation HIF1 and mTOR activity limit GLP1-mediated activation (i.e., via PKIB). Accordingly, by inhibiting the PKI pathway (e.g., with an inhibitor of HIF1, mTOR or PKIB) the activity of the GLP1 activation pathway can be restored.</p>The studies presented are of particular interest given that a sizable percentage of type II diabetic patients appear to be unresponsive to GLP1 agonist therapy (Hall et al., 2013; Preumont et al., 2012; Buysschaert et al., 2012). Such GLP1 agonist resistance is likely mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of PKIs (e.g., PKIA and PKIB). Accordingly, inhibitors of PKI or PKI pathway components (such as inhibitors of HIF1 or mTOR) could be used to restore sensitivity to GLP1 agonist therapy or treat subject that have a resistance to GLP1 agonist therapies. Thus, the methodologies provided herein can provide avenues for treatment of insulin resistance also was significantly increasing the effectiveness of currently available therapies.</p>II. PKI Pathway InhibitorsmTOR Inhibitors</p>In some aspects, PKI inhibitors for use according to present embodiments comprise mTOR inhibitors. Such mTOR inhibitors include rapamycin which is an immunosuppressive lactam macrolide that is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus.

In certain aspects this can be accomplished by administration of an inhibitory nucleic acid that reduced expression of PKIA and/or PKIB. Examples of inhibitory nucleic acids include, without limitation, antisense nucleic acids, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), microRNAs (miRNA) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that are complimentary to all or part of PKI mRNA. An inhibitory nucleic acid can, for example, inhibit the transcription of a gene in a cell, mediate degradation of an mRNA in a cell and/or inhibit the translation of a polypeptide from a mRNA. Typically an inhibitory nucleic acid may be from 16 to 1000 or more nucleotides long, and in certain embodiments from 18 to 100 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acid may be 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 nucleotides long. In some aspects an inhibitory nucleic acid may comprise one or more modified nucleotide or nucleic acid analog. Typically, an inhibitory nucleic acid will inhibit the expression of a single gene within a cell; however, in certain embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acid will inhibit the expression of more than one gene within a cell.</p>In some aspects an inhibitory nucleic acid can form a double-stranded structure. For example, the double-stranded structure may result from two separate nucleic acid molecules that are partially or completely complementary. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acid may comprise only a single nucleic acid or nucleic acid analog and form a double-stranded structure by complementing with itself (e.g., forming a hairpin loop). The double-stranded structure of the inhibitory nucleic acid may comprise 16 to 500 or more contiguous nucleobases. For example, the inhibitory nucleic aci",

For example expression can be under the transcriptional control of a RNA Polymerase III promoter, such as the U6 promoter. Such promoters are preferred for the expression of short RNA sequences, such as siRNA molecules. In certain aspects tissue specific promoters may also be employed, for example promoter that express nucleic acids in pancreatic islet cells. Specific vectors to express inhibitory nucleic acids are well known in the art. For example the commercially available pSUPER RNAi System\u2122 available from OilgoEngine\u00ae and the pSilencer\u2122 siRNA expression vectors available from Life Technologies\u2122.</p>In still a further embodiment an inhibitor of PKI (e.g., an inhibitor of PKIA or PKIB) is molecule that binds to and inhibits PKI.

Additional HIF1 inhibitors, which inhibit HIF1 protein translation include, without limitation, ENZ-2208 and PX-478.</p>III. GLP1 Agonists and Incretin-Inducing AgentsGLP1 is itself derived from the transcription product of the proglucagon gene. GLP1 is primarily produced by the intestinal L cells that secrete GLP1 as a gut hormone. The biologically active forms of GLP1 are: GLP1-(7-37) and GLP1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub>, which result from selective cleavage of the proglucagon molecule. The incretin hormone GLP1 enhances islet cell survival through induction of the cAMP pathway in beta cells as further detailed herein (see, also Drucker, 2006; Drucker and Nauck, 2006).</p>Certain aspects of the embodiments concern administration of GLP1 agonists to a subject in conjunction with a PKI pathway inhibitor. Likewise, some aspects of the embodiments concern treatment of subjects who are resistant to a GLP1 agonist therapy (with a PKI pathway inhibitor). In various embodiments, the GLP1 agonist may be selected from the group consisting of exenatide, bydureon, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, and lixisenatide.</p>Exenatide</p>Exenatide is a GLP1 agonist that may be used to maintain blood glucose levels and treat aspects of diabetes. Exenatide is marketed as Byetta\u00ae and manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and Company. Exenatide typically administered to a patient as a subcutaneous injection, e.g., of the abdomen, thigh, or arm. Exenatide is typically administered within about 1 hour before the first and last meal of the day.</p>Exenatide is typically supplied for subcutaneous injection as a sterile, preserved isotonic solution in a glass cartridge that has been assembled in a pen-injector (pen). Each milliliter (mL) may contain about 250 micrograms (mcg) of synthetic exenatide, about 2.2 mg metacresol as an antimicrobial preservative, mannitol as a tonicity-adjusting agent, and glacial acetic acid and sodium acetate trihydrate in water for injection as a buffering solution at pH 4.5. Prefilled pens may be used to deliver unit doses of 5 mcg or 10 mcg. Commercially available prefilled pens can typically deliver 60 doses to provide for 30 days of twice daily administration (BID). Although, in certain preferred embodiments, exenatide may be administered subcutaneously, it is nonetheless anticipated that exenatide may in certain embodiments be administered via another route, e.g., int",
    " Taspoglutide is a long-acting GLP1 analog in which amino acids 8 and 35 of the native GLP1 peptide are substituted with aminoisobutyric acid to prevent DPP-IV and protease-mediated cleavage at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. R1583 may be formulated as a zinc-based drug to prolong its PK activity. Various dosages of taspoglutide may be administered to a patient, e.g., 1-30 mg s.c. Taspoglutide is manufactured by Ipsen and Roche. Taspoglutide is further described in Nauck et al. (2009), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>Lixisenatide</p>Lixisenatide (AVE0010) is a GLP1 agonist that may be used according to the present embodiments. Lixisenatide is an exendin-4-based GLP1 receptor agonist that exhibits approximately 4-fold greater affinity for the human GLP1 receptor compared with native GLP1. Lixisenatide may be administered to a subject, e.g., once or twice a day. In some embodiments, metformin and/or SU therapy may be administered in combination with a GLP1 agonist such as, e.g., Lixisenatide. Lixisenatide may be administered at a dosage of, e.g., about 5-20 micrograms (mcg)/injection. The half-life of AVE0010 may range from about 2.5 to 4 hours. Clinical trials have indicated that lixisenatide can significantly improve glycaemic control in mildly hyperglycaemic patients with Type 2 diabetes on metformin (Ratner et al. 2010).</p>DPP-4 Inhibitors</p>In some aspects embodiments a DPP-4 inhibitor is administered to a subject in conjunction with a PKI pathway inhibitor. Likewise, some aspects of the embodiments concern treatment of subjects who are resistant to a DPP-4 inhibitor therapy. In general DPP-4 inhibitors function by increasing incretin levels (GLP1 and GIP agonist levels), which inhibit glucagon release increase insulin secretion, decrease gastric emptying, and decrease blood glucose levels. Importantly, most DPP-4 inhibitors can be administered orally. Examples of DPP-4 inhibitors for use according to the embodiments include, without limitation, Sitagliptin (Januvia/MK-0431), Vildagliptin (Galvus), Saxagliptin (Onglyza), Linagliptin, Anagliptin, Teneligliptin, Alogliptin, Gemigliptin and Dutogliptin.</p>IV.

Consisting of three closely related polypeptides (PKIA, PKIB, PKIG) the PKIs have been shown to bind with high specificity and affinity to PKA; they also contain a potent nuclear export signal that maintains PKA in the cytoplasm (Taylor et al., 2005) (Fantozzi et al., 1994; Wen et al., 1994; Wen et al., 1995). PKIB was selectively upregulated in INS1 cells and cultured pancreatic islets following prolonged exposure to high glucose (FIGS. 9a and 9b). Indeed, PKIB mRNA and protein amounts were also increased in pancreatic islets but not other metabolic tissues from HFD and HCD fed mice relative to controls (FIG. 3f; FIGS. 9c and 9d).</p>In immunohistochemical studies, PKIB was detected in beta cells of the pancreatic islets, but not in surrounding glucagon producing alpha cells or in acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas (FIG. 9e). Similar to its effects in mouse islets, chronic glucose exposure also promoted PKIB expression in human islets, thereby attenuating CREB phosphorylation and target gene expression (FIGS. 9f-9j).</p>Based on its proposed role in nuclear export, it was reasoned that PKIB may reduce CREB phosphorylation by blocking the nuclear accumulation of PKA. Supporting this idea, exposure to FSK promoted an increase in nuclear amounts of PKA catalytic subunit in INS1 cells maintained under low glucose conditions but not in cells maintained on high glucose (FIG. 3g).</p>Although PKI potently inhibits PKA activity, the importance of this pathway for insulin secretion is unclear, as increases in circulating glucose modulate insulin secretion primilary through calcium signaling. In that event, the PKIB would cause only modest changes in circulating glucose and insulin concentrations. To evaluate the effects of this inhibitor on glucose homeostasis, the inventors employed a double stranded AAV8 vector expressing PKIB under control of the mouse insulin promoter, which targets transgene expression specifically to beta cells. Over-expression of AAV8-encoded PKIB in MIN6 insulinoma cells reduced PKA activity and correspondingly disrupted CREB phosphorylation in response to FSK treatment (FIG. 4a). Following intra-peritoneal administration, a control AAV-MIP-EGFP virus was expressed in pancreatic islets but not other tissues such as liver and testis (FIG. 4b). Ad libitum circulating glucose concentrations increased progressively over a 6 weeks period in mice expressing AAV encoded PKIB (FIGS. 4c and 4d). Although their body weights were identical to controls, PKIB-over-expressing animals became relatively glucose intolerant and they had lower circulating concentrations of insulin in response to oral glucose tolerance testing, indicating that PKIB expression is sufficient to disrupt beta cell function (FIGS. 4e and 4f).</p>Mice with a knockout of PKIB were used to determine whether the upregulation of this inhibitor in response to high fat diet feeding contrib"
