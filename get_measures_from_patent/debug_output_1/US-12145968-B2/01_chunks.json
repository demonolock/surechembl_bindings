    "60. Individual gp160 polypeptides form a homotrimer and undergo glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus as well as processing to remove the signal peptide, and cleavage by a cellular protease between approximately positions 511/512 to generate separate gp120 and gp41 polypeptide chains, which remain associated as gp120-gp41 protomers within the homotrimer. The ectodomain (that is, the extracellular portion) of the HIV-1 Env trimer undergoes several structural rearrangements from a prefusion mature (cleaved) closed conformation that evades antibody recognition, through intermediate conformations that bind to receptors CD4 and co-receptor (either CCR5 or CXCR4), to a postfusion conformation. The HIV-1 Env ectodomain includes the gp120 protein (approximately HIV-1 Env positions 31-511) and the gp41 ectodomain (approximately HIV-1 Env positions 512-644). An HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer includes a protein complex of three HIV-1 Env ectodomains. Mature gp120 includes approximated HIV-1 Env residues 31-511, contains most of the external, surface-exposed, domains of the HIV-1 Env trimer, and it is gp120 which binds both to cellular CD4 receptors and to cellular chemokine receptors (such as CCR5). A mature gp120 polypeptide is an extracellular polypeptide that interacts with the gp41 ectodomain to form an HIV-1 Env protomer that trimerizes to form the HIV-1 Env trimer. The mature gp120 wild-type polypeptide is heavily N-glycosylated, giving rise to an apparent molecular weight of 120 kD. Native gp120 includes five conserved regions (C1-C5) and five regions of high variability (V1-V5). See FIG. 11 for an illustration of gp120 primary and secondary structures.</p>Variable region 1 and Variable Region 2 (V1/V2 domain) of gp120 are comprised of \u02dc50-90 residues which contain two of the most variable portions of HIV-1 (the V1 domain and the V2 loop), and one in ten residues of the V1/V2 domain are N-glycosylated. Despite the diversity and glycosylation of the V1/V2 domain, a number of broadly neutralizing human antibodies have been identified that target this region, including PG9 and PGT122. In some examples the V1/V2 domain includes gp120 positions 126-196. Variable region 3 (V3) of gp120 includes approximately 35-45 amino acids. In some examples the V1/V2 domain includes gp120 positions 296-331. Mature gp41 includes approximately HIV-1 Env residues 512-860, and includes cytosolic-, transmembrane- and ecto-domains. The gp41 ectodomain (including approximately HIV-1 Env residues 512-644) can interact with gp120 to form an HIV-1 Env protomer that trimerizes to form the HIV-1 Env trimer. See FIG. 3 for an illustration of the primary and secondary structure of a gp41 ectodomain.</p>The numbering used in the disclosed HIV-1 Env proteins and fragments thereof is relative to the HXB2 numbering scheme as set forth in Numbering Positions in HIV Relative to HXB2CG Bette Korber et al., Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1998: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amin",
    ". The enhanced cleavage cite can include, for example, substitution of six arginine resides for the four residues of the native cleavage site (e.g., REKR (SEQ ID NO: 572) to RRRRRR (SEQ ID NO: 573). As used herein, reference to \u201cR6\u201d indicates that a HIV Env protein includes the RRRRRR (SEQ ID NO: 573) substitution for the native furin cleavage site. It will be understood that protease cleavage of the furin or enhanced cleavage site separating gp120 and gp41 can remove a few amino acids from either end of the cleavage site.</p>Stabilization of the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer or immunogenic fragment in the prefusion mature closed conformation prevents transition of the HIV-1 Env ectodomain to the CD-bound open conformation. Thus, the disclosed recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimers can be specifically bound by an antibody that is specific for the mature closed conformation of HIV-1 Env (e.g., VRC26, PGT151, PGT122, or PGT145), but are not specifically bound by an antibody specific for the CD4-bound open conformation, of HIV-1 Env (e.g., 17b mAb in the presence of sCD4). In one example, the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer is not specifically bound by an antibody specific for a CD4-induced epitope on the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer, such as the 17b antibody. Methods of determining if a recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer includes a CD4-induced epitope are known in the art and disclosed herein (See Examples 1 and 2). For example, the antibody binding assay can be conducted in the presence of a molar excess of soluble CD4 as described in Sanders et al. (Plos Pathogens, 9, e1003618, 2013).</p>In several embodiments, the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimers can be specifically bound by an antibody that specifically binds to the V1V2 domain on a HIV-1 Env trimer, but not an Env monomer. Exemplary antibodies with such antigen binding characteristics include the PGT141, PGT142, PGT143, PGT144, PGT145, and VRC26 antibodies. Additional examples include the PG9, PG16, and CH01-CH04 antibodies. Accordingly, in some embodiments the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer specifically binds to an antibody (such as a PGT141, PGT142, PGT143, PGT144, PGT145, and VRC26 antibody) that specifically binds to the V1V2 domain of a HIV-1 Env in its trimeric, but not monomeric, form with a dissociation constant of less than 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>Molar, such as less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>Molar, less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>Molar, or less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>Molar. Specific binding can be determined by methods known in the art. The determination of specific binding may readily be made by using or adapting routine procedures, such as ELISA, immunocompetition, surface plasmon resonance, or other immunosorbant assays (described in many standard texts, including Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSHL, New York, 1999).</p>The recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimers or immunogenic fragments are stabilized in the prefusion mature closed conformation by one or more amino acid substitutions. Thus, the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimers or immunogenic fragments are not stabilized by non-specific crosslinking, for example glutaraldehyde crosslinking of membrane bound HIV-1 Env trimers.</p>In several embodiments, the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer is soluble in aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer dissolves to a concentration of at least 0.5 mg/ml (such as at least 1.0 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml, 2.0 mg/ml, 3.0 mg/ml, 4.0 mg/ml or at least 5.0 mg/ml) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) at room temperature (e.g., 20-22 degrees Celsius) and remains dissolved for at least for at least 12 hours (such as at least 24 hours, at least 48 hours, at least one week, at least two weeks, or more time). In one embodiment, ",
    " sequence of this chimera is provided as SEQ ID NO: 772. Structural analysis of the gp120 and gp41 contacts confirm that there is minimal disruption between the gp120-gp41 interface when substituting this strain. The BG505.SOSIP/CAP45 chimera had nearly full gp120/gp41 cleavage, as shown by SDS-page (FIG. 50, left). Further, antigenic analysis by ELISA confirmed that this chimera specifically bound to quaternary specific antibodies, but not to non- or poorly-neutralizing antibodies (FIG. 50, right).</p>The neutralization profile of several neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies was compared with the antigenic profile of a chimeric HIV-1 Env ectodomain based on the native DU156 virus. As shown in FIG. 51, the neutralization profile correlates with the antigenic profile, particularly for the chimeric HIV-1 Env ectodomain including the 201C/433C substitutions.</p>Many additional chimeric HIV-1 Env ectodomain proteins were designed and produced, including those provided as SEQ ID NOs: 379-386, 579-595, 764-772, 856-1056, 1077-1098, and 1114-1200. The details of the design of each of these chimeric Env proteins are provided in Table 13. Additional recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomains including stabilizing substitutions and based on more HIV-1 strains were also produced, including those provided as SEQ ID NOs: 1057-1077. The recombinant HIV-1 Env ectodomains were expressed in cells and the corresponding antigenic characteristics of each ectodomain was evaluated by bind antibody binding assay.</p>Binding to several different antibodies was assayed to evaluate the antigenic profile of each the recombinant HIV-1 Env proteins (FIGS. 44 and 53). The antibodies tested included VRC26 and PGT145 (which bind V1V2 specific epitopes present on the prefusion mature closed conformation of HIV-1 Env), F105 (which binds an epitope that is not present on the prefusion mature closed conformation of HIV-1 Env), 17b (which binds a CD4-induced epitope) in the presence or absence of sCD4, PGT151 and 35O22 (which bind conformational epitopes including gp120 and gp41 residues of HIV-1 Env in its prefusion mature conformation), PGT122 (which binds a conformation epitope including V1V2 and V3-glycan residues), 447-52D (which binds a V3-loop epitope), and VRC01 (which binds the CD4 binding site).</p>FIG. 53 shows the antigenic readout of many chimeric HIV-1 Env ectodomains, each of which was stabilized in a prefusion mature conformation using the SOSIP substitutions and a 201C-433C disulfide bond. The antigenicity assays show that all of the recombinant HIV-1 Env proteins tested exhibited little to no binding to the 17b antibody, even in the presence of a molar excess of soluble CD4. This finding illustrates the effectiveness of this mutation (201C-433C) for stabilizing the HIV-1 Env ectodomain in a conformation that is resistant to CD4-induced change.</p>Additionally, bioinformatics algorithms were used to identify chimeric HIV-1 Env ectodomains that exhibited relatively st"
