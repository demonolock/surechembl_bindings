    "reported for mice [21]. For the mouse study, at 48 h p.i., animals were sacrificed and their peritoneal cavities were exposed for post-mortem CT and 2D NIR fluorescence imaging to evaluate the co-localization of the CT and fluorescence signals. For the rabbit study, image-guided surgical removal of the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes was performed at 4-7 days post-liposome administration. Real-time fluorescence imaging (overlaid with white light) of the surgical site containing the tumor and malignant lymph nodes was performed using the PINPOINT\u00ae system (808\u00b15 nm, Novadaq, Mississauga, Canada).</p>All CT-based image analysis was performed using Microview (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis., USA) and custom in-house code written using MATLAB (MathWorks\u00ae, Natick, Mass.). The tumor volumes were contoured using a semi-automated threshold based method [12] and the blood volume-of-interest (VOI) were drawn manually on the right carotid artery. The mean and standard deviation of the voxel signal distribution within each VOI was calculated. All NIR fluorescence image analysis was performed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.) by manually placing regions-of-interest (ROI) on selected structures of interest and background and measuring the mean and standard deviation of the signal level over multiple image frames.</p>Post tumor and organ excision, tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks, cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Ki-67. An experienced pathologist (Dr. Stefano Serra) evaluated all histo-pathology slides for disease identification and confirmation.</p>Results:The CF800 liposomes (FIG. 1) co-encapsulates a commercially available CT contrast agent iohexol and a clinically approved NIR optical dye indocyanine green (ICG) at a mole ratio of 1000:1 (iohexol to ICG) and a weight ratio of 500:1 (iodine to ICG). The difference in concentration for the two encapsulated imaging agents was set to compensate for the difference in detection sensitivity between CT and fluorescence imaging. We also successfully showed our ability to reproducibly fabricate the dual-modality liposomes with consistent particle size, lipid and imaging molecule concentrations (FIG. 1).</p>In vitro photostability tests demonstrated that liposomal encapsulation protects ICG from photodegradation, even after repeated excitation. After 3 days of storage at room temperature, following 6 imaging sessions with high-power light exposure, and at a 100-fold dilution in water and a 1:10 ethanol/water mixture, CF800 (n=4) retained 78\u00b18% and 92\u00b111% of its original fluorescence signal, respectively. Free ICG diluted in water, a 1:10 ethanol/water mixture and a 0.5:10 iohexol/water mixture yielded only 8\u00b12%, 3\u00b11%, 7\u00b12% of its original fluorescence, respectively. FIG. 2a shows the results of a separate photostability test conducted up to 21 days showing the high degree of stability of the iohexol and ICG co-encapsulating liposome system c"
