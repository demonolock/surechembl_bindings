    "inutes in a final volume of 500 \u03bcliter of Hepes incubation buffer (pH 7.2) together with 0.2-20 nM tritiated-pentagastrin (Amersham International, England).</p>In the displacement experiments, membranes were incubated with a single concentration (2 nM) of ligand, together with increasing concentrations (10<sup>-11</sup> to 10<sup>-14</sup> M) of competitive test compound. In each case, the nonspecific binding was defined as that persisting in the presence of the unlabeled octapeptide CCK<sub>26-33</sub> (10<sup>-6</sup> M).</p>Following incubation, radioactivity bound to membranes was separated from that free in solution by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and washed three times with 4 mL of ice cold Tris-HCl buffer. Filters from samples incubated with tritiated-pentagastrin were placed in polyethylene vials with 4 mL of scintillation cocktail, and the radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry (efficiency 47-52%).</p>The specific binding to CCK receptor sites was defined as the total bound tritiated-pentagastrin minus the amount of tritiated-pentagastrin bound in the presence of 10<sup>-6</sup> octapeptide, CCK<sub>26-33</sub>.</p>Saturation curves for specific tritiated-pentagastrin binding to mouse cortical membranes were analyzed by the methods of Scatchard (Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 51:660-672, 1949, and Hill (J. Physiol. 40:IV-VIII, 1910, to provide estimates for the maximum number of binding sites (B<sub>max</sub>) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>a</sub>).</p>In displacement experiments, inhibition curves were analyzed by either logit-log plots or the iterative curve fitting computer program ALLFIT (DeLean, Munson and Redbard, 1978) to provide estimates of the IC<sub>50</sub> and nH (apparent Hill coefficient) values). (IC<sub>50</sub> values were defined as the concentration of test compound required to produce 50% inhibition of specific binding.)</p>The inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) of the test compound was then calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation: ##EQU1## where [L] is the concentration of radiolabel and K<sub>a</sub> is the equilibrium dissociation constant.</p>The K<sub>i</sub> /M values for several representative compounds of the present invention are present in Table III.</p>Compounds of the present invention are useful as appetite suppressants as based on the tests described hereinbelow.</p>In the Palatable Diet Feeding assay, adult male Hooded Lister rats weighing between 200-400 g were housed individually and trained to eat a palatable diet. This diet consisted of Nestles sweetened condensed milk, powdered rat food and rat water which when blended together set to a firm consistency. Each rat was presented with 20-30 g of the palatable diet for 30 minutes per day during the light phase of the light-dark cycle over a training period of five days. The intake of palatable diet was measured by weighing the food container before and after the 30-minute access period (limits of accuracy 0.1 g). Care was taken to collect and correct for any spillage of the diet. Rats had free access to pellet food and water except during the 30-minute test period.</p>After the training period, dose-response curves were constructed for CCK8 and several representative compounds of the present invention (n=8-10 rats per dose level). MPE<sub>50</sub> values (\u00b195% confidence limits) were obtained for the anorectic effects of these compounds and are shown in Table III.</p>In therapeutic use as appetite suppression agents, the compounds of the instant invention are administered to the patient at dosage levels of from about 200 to ab"
