{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nIn the displacement experiments, membranes were incubated with a single concentration (2 nM) of ligand, together with increasing concentrations (10<sup>-11</sup> to 10<sup>-14</sup> M) of competitive test compound.\nIn each case, the nonspecific binding was defined as that persisting in the presence of the unlabeled octapeptide CCK<sub>26-33</sub> (10<sup>-6</sup> M).\nThe specific binding to CCK receptor sites was defined as the total bound tritiated-pentagastrin minus the amount of tritiated-pentagastrin bound in the presence of 10<sup>-6</sup> octapeptide, CCK<sub>26-33</sub>.\n(IC<sub>50</sub> values were defined as the concentration of test compound required to produce 50% inhibition of specific binding.)\nThe K<sub>i</sub> /M values for several representative compounds of the present invention are present in Table III.\nMPE<sub>50</sub> values (\u00b195% confidence limits) were obtained for the anorectic effects of these compounds and are shown in Table III."}
