DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0026] Provided are methods of treating a cancer that co-expresses one or more placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) proteins and a cancer target antigen in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to the patient a treatment regimen wherein the treatment regimen comprises administration of one or more standard-of-care inhibitor or anti-proliferative agents that increase cell surface expression of the one or more ALPP proteins and one or more ALPP protein-targeting agents. Also provided are methods of selecting a patient having a cancer that co-expresses one or more placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) proteins and a cancer target antigen, comprising: assaying for baseline cell surface expression levels of the one or more ALPP proteins in a biological sample obtained from the patient; and assaying for co-expression of one or more cancer cell surf"
