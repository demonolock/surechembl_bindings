    "ding Vsp39 has not been cloned, a series of related tandem paralogous genes encoding 39-kDa proteins with 83- 90% identity was identified (Gabe, J. D., E. Dragon, R. J. Chang, and M. T. \n\n McCaman. 1998, Identification of a linked set of genes in Serpulina hyodysenteriae (B204) predicted to encode closely related 39-kilodalton extracytoplasmic proteins. J. Bacteriol. 180:444-448). (McCaman, M. T., K. Auer, W. Foley, and J. D. Gabe. 1999, Vet. Microbiol. 68:273-283). A putative 30-kDa lipoprotein, BmpB, was found to react with convalescent pig sera. No further data of this protein have been published however (Lee, B. J., T. La, A. S. Mikosza, and D. J. Hampson. 2000, Vet. Microbiol. 76:245-257).</p>It is therefore clear that there is a need for new and effective vaccines, especially vaccines that provide broad protection.</p>It is an objective of the present invention to provide novel vaccines for combating Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infections.</p>Two novel genes have now surprisingly been found, which are thought to encode novel surface expressed bacterial lipoproteins. These lipoproteins, BlpB and BlpC turn out to be suitable vaccine components, alone and especially in combination with each other, in vaccines for combating Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infections. Both genes have now been cloned and sequenced and their sequences are depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1 (BlpB) and SEQ ID NO: 3 (BlpC). The first ORF, blpB encodes a lipoprotein of 537 amino acids with a molecular mass of 61 kD (as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2). The second ORF, blpC encodes a lipoprotein of 179 amino acids with a molecular mass of 20 kD(as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 4).</p>It is well-known in the art, that many different nucleic acid sequences can encode one and the same protein. This phenomenon is commonly known as wobble in the second and especially the third base of each triplet encoding an amino acid. This phenomenon can result in a heterology of about 30% for two nucleic acid \n\n sequences still encoding the same protein. Therefore, two nucleic acid sequences having a sequence homology of about 70 % can still encode one and the same protein.</p>Thus, one embodiment relates to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a 61 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or a part of said nucleic acid sequence that encodes an immunogenic fragment of said lipoprotein wherein said nucleic acid sequence or said part thereof has at least 70 % homology with the nucleic acid sequence of the Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>The 61 molecular weight is determined in gel electrophoresis on a polyacryl amide gel. Due to slight variability of molecular weight determination frequently encountered in the art, the molecular weight can vary between 56 an 66 kD. Therefore the molecular weight of the lipoproteins according to the invention should be interpreted as to be 61 +/- 5 kD.</p>Preferably, a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention encoding this 61 Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or a part of that nucleic acid sequence that encodes an immunogenic fragment of that lipoprotein has at least 80 %, preferably 90 %, more preferably 95 % homology with the nucleic acid sequence of the Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>Even more preferred is a homology level of 98%, 99% or even 100%.</p>The level of nucleotide homology can be determined with the computer program \"BLAST 2 SEQUENCES\" by selecting sub-program: \"BLASTN\" that can be found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html. \n\n A reference for this program is Tatiana A. Tatusova, Thomas L. Madden FEMS Microbiol. Letters 174: 247-250 (1999). Parameters used are the default parameters:</p>Reward for a match: +1. Penalty for a mismatch: -2. Open gap: 5. Extension gap: 2. Gap x_dropoff: 50.</p>Another embodiment relates to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or a part of said nucleic acid sequence that encodes an immunogenic fragment of said lipoprotein wherein said nucleic acid sequence or said part thereof has at least 70 % homology with the nucleic acid sequence of the Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3.</p>The 20 kD molecular weight is determined in gel electrophoresis on a polyacryl amide gel. Due to slight variability of molecular weight determination frequently encountered in the art, the molecular weight can vary between 15 and 25 kD. Therefore the molecular weight of the lipoproteins according to the invention should be interpreted as to be 20 +/- 5 kD.</p>Preferably, a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention encoding this 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or a part of that nucleic acid sequence that encodes an immunogenic fragment of that lipoprotein has at least 80 %, preferably 90 %, more preferably 95 % homology with the nucleic acid sequence of the Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3.</p>Even more preferred is a homology level of 98%, 99% or even 100%. Nucleotide sequences that are complementary to the sequence depicted in SEQ \n\n ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 or nucleotide sequences that comprise tandem arrays of the sequences according to the invention are also within the scope of the invention.</p>Since the present invention discloses nucleic acid sequences encoding novel 61 kD and 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoproteins, it is now for the first time possible to obtain these proteins in sufficient quantities. This can e.g. be done by using expression systems to express the whole or parts of a gene encoding the protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof. Therefore, in a more preferred form of this embodiment, the invention relates to DNA fragments comprising a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention. A DNA fragment is a stretch of nucleotides that functions as a carrier for a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention. Such DNA fragments can e.g. be plasmids, into which a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention is cloned. Such DNA fragments are e.g. useful for enhancing the amount of DNA for use as a primer and for expression of a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention, as described below.</p>An essential requirement for the expression of the nucleic acid sequence is an adequate promoter functionally linked to the nucleic acid sequence, so that the nucleic acid sequence is under the control of the promoter. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that the choice of a promoter extends to any eukaryotic, prokaryotic or viral promoter capable of directing gene transcription in cells used as host cells for protein expression. Therefore, an even more preferred form of this embodiment relates to a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a DNA fragment and/or a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention wherein the nucle",
    "ogy 50, 725-732, 1984), SV40 immediate early promoter (Sprague J. et al., J. Virology 45, 773 ,1983), the SV-40 promoter (Berman, P.W. et al., Science, 222, 524-527, 1983), the metallothionein promoter (Brinster, R.L. et al., Nature 296, 39-42, 1982), the heat shock promoter (Voellmy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, 4949-53, 1985), the major late promoter of Ad2 and the \u03b2-actin promoter (Tang et al., Nature 356, 152-154, 1992). The \n\n regulatory sequences may also include terminator and poly-adenylation sequences. Amongst the sequences that can be used are the well known bovine growth hormone poly-adenylation sequence, the SV40 poly-adenylation sequence, the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) terminator and poly-adenylation sequences.</p>Bacterial, yeast, fungal, insect and vertebrate cell expression systems are very frequently used systems. Such systems are well-known in the art and generally available, e.g. commercially through Clontech Laboratories, Inc. 4030 Fabian Way, Palo Alto, California 94303-4607, USA. Next to these expression systems, parasite-based expression systems are attractive expression systems. Such systems are e.g. described in the French Patent Application with Publication number 2 714 074, and in US NTIS Publication No US 08/043109 (Hoffman, S. and Rogers, W.: Public. Date 1 December 1993).</p>A still even more preferred form of this embodiment of the invention relates to Live Recombinant Carriers (LRCs) comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or an immunogenic fragment thereof according to the invention, a DNA fragment according to the invention or a recombinant DNA molecule according to the invention. These LRCs are micro-organisms or viruses in which additional genetic information, in this case a nucleic acid sequence encoding the 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or an immunogenic fragment thereof according to the invention has been cloned. Pigs infected with such LRCs will produce an immunological response not only against the immunogens of the carrier, but also against the immunogenic parts of the protein(s) for which the genetic code is additionally cloned into the LRC, e.g. the novel 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein gene according to the invention. \n\n As an example of bacterial LRCs, attenuated Salmonella strains known in the art can very attractively be used.</p>Also, live recombinant carrier parasites have i.a. been described by Vermeulen, A. N. (Int. Journ. Parasitol. 28: 1121-1130 (1998)). Furthermore, LRC viruses may be used as a way of transporting the nucleic acid sequence into a target cell. Live recombinant carrier viruses are also called vector viruses. Viruses often used as vectors are Vaccinia viruses (Panicali et al; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79: 4927 (1982), Herpesviruses (E.P.A. 0473210A2), and Retroviruses (Valerio, D. et al; in Baum, S.J., Dicke, K.A., Lotzova, E. and Pluznik, D.H. (Eds.), Experimental Haematology today - 1988. Springer Verlag, New York: pp. 92-99 (1989)).</p>The technique of in vivo homologous recombination, well-known in the art, can be used to introduce a recombinant nucleic acid sequence into the genome of a bacterium, parasite or virus of choice, capable of inducing expression of the inserted nucleic acid sequence according to the invention in the host animal.</p>Finally another form of this embodiment of the invention relates to a host cell comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein according to the invention, a DNA fragment comprising such a nucleic acid sequence or a recombinant DNA molecule comprising such a nucleic acid sequence under the control of a functionally linked promoter. This form also relates to a host cell containing a live recombinant carrier comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding a 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or an immunogenic fragment thereof according to the invention.</p>A host cell may be a cell of bacterial origin, e.g. Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacill\u03c5s species, in combination with bacteria-based plasmids as pBR322, or bacterial expression vectors as pGEX, or with bacteriophages. The host cell may also be of eukaryotic origin, e.g. yeast-cells in combination with \n\nyeast-specific vector molecules, or higher eukaryotic cells like insect cells (Luckow et al; Bio-technology 6: 47-55 (1988)) in combination with vectors or recombinant baculoviruses, plant cells in combination with e.g. Ti-plasmid based vectors or plant viral vectors (Barton, K.A. et al; Cell 32: 1033 (1983), mammalian cells like Hela cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) or Crandell Feline Kidney-cells, also with appropriate vectors or recombinant viruses.</p>Another embodiment of the invention relates to the novel 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein and to immunogenic fragments thereof according to the invention.</p>The concept of immunogenic fragments will be defined below.</p>One form of this embodiment relates to a 61 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein and to immunogenic fragments thereof, having an amino acid sequence homology of at least 70 % with the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>In a preferred form, the embodiment relates to such Brachyspira lipoproteins and immunogenic fragments thereof, that have a sequence homology of at least 80 %, preferably 90 %, more preferably 95 % homology to the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2. Even more preferred is a homology level of 98%, 99% or even 100%.</p>Another form of this embodiment relates to a 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein and to immunogenic fragments thereof, having an amino acid sequence homology of at least 70 % with the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 4. \n\n In a preferred form, the embodiment relates to such Brachyspira lipoproteins and immunogenic fragments thereof, that have a sequence homology of at least 80 %, preferably 90 %, more preferably 95 % homology to the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 4. Even more preferred is a homology level of 98%, 99% or even 100%.</p>Another form of this embodiment relates to such 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoproteins and immunogenic fragments of said protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention.</p>The level of protein homology can be determined with the computer program</p>\"BLAST 2 SEQUENCES\" by selecting sub-program: \"BLASTP\", that can be found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html.</p>A reference for this program is Tatiana A. Tatusova, Thomas L. Madden FEMS Microbiol. Letters 174: 247-250 (1999). Matrix used: \"blosum62\". Parameters used are the default parameters:</p>Open gap: 11. Extension gap: 1. Gap x_dropoff: 50.</p>It will be understood that, for the particular proteins embraced herein, natural variations can exist between individual Brachyspira strains. These variations may be demonstrated by (an) amino acid difference(s) in the overall sequence or by deletions, substitutions, insertions, inversions or additions of (an) amino acid(s) in said sequence. Amino acid substitutions which do not essentially alter biological and immunological activities, have been described, e.g. by Neurath et al in \"The Proteins\" Academic Press New York (1979). Amino acid replacements between related amino acids or replacements which have occurred frequently in evolution are, inter alia, Ser/Ala, Ser/Gly, Asp/Gly, Asp/Asn, lle/Val (see Dayhof, M.D., Atlas of protein sequence and structure, Nat. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington D.C., 1978, vol. 5, suppl. 3). Other amino acid substitutions include Asp/Glu, \n\nThr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/",
    " of B-cell epitopes. Also, given the sequence of the gene encoding any protein, computer algorithms are able to designate specific protein fragments as the immunologically important epitopes on the basis of their sequential and/or structural agreement with epitopes that are now known. The determination of these regions is based on a combination of the hydrophilicity criteria according to Hopp and Woods (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78: 38248-3828 (1981)), and the secondary structure aspects according to Chou and Fasman (Advances in Enzymology 47: 45-148 (1987) and US Patent 4,554,101). T-cell epitopes can likewise be predicted from the sequence by computer with the aid of Berzofsky's amphiphilicity criterion (Science 235, 1059-1062 (1987) and US Patent application NTIS US 07/005,885). A condensed overview is found in: Shan Lu on common principles: Tibtech 9: 238-242 (1991), Good et al on Malaria epitopes; Science 235: 1059-1062 (1987), Lu for a review; Vaccine 10: 3-7 (1992), Berzofsky for HIV-epitopes; The FASEB Journal 5:2412-2418 (1991 ). An immunogenic fragment usually has a minimal length of 8 amino acids, preferably more then 8, such as 9, 10, 12, 15 or even 20 amino acids. The nucleic acid sequences encoding such a fragment therefore have a length of at least 24, but preferably 27, 30, 36, 45 or even 60 nucleic acids.</p>Therefore, one form of still another embodiment of the invention relates to vaccines for combating Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infection, that comprise a 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae protein or immunogenic fragments \n\n thereof, according to the invention as described above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>Still another embodiment of the present invention relates to the 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae protein according to the invention or immunogenic fragments thereof for use in a vaccine.</p>Still another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of a nucleic acid sequence, a DNA fragment, a recombinant DNA molecule, a live recombinant carrier, a host cell or a lipoprotein or an immunogenic fragment thereof according to the invention for the manufacturing of a vaccine for combating Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infection.</p>One way of making a vaccine according to the invention is by growing the bacteria, followed by biochemical purification of the 61 kD and/or 20 kD</p>Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or immunogenic fragments thereof, from the bacterium. This is however a very time-consuming way of making the vaccine.</p>It is therefore much more convenient to use the expression products of the gene encoding a 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or immunogenic fragments thereof in vaccines. This is possible for the first time now because the nucleic acid sequence of the genes encoding a 61 kD and 20 kD lipoprotein are provided in the present invention.</p>Vaccines based upon the expression products of these genes can easily be made by admixing the protein according to the invention or immunogenic fragments thereof according to the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as described below. \n\nAlternatively, a vaccine according to the invention can comprise live recombinant carriers as described above, capable of expressing the protein according to the invention or immunogenic fragments thereof. Such vaccines, e.g. based upon a Salmonella carrier or a viral carrier e.g. a Herpesvirus vector have the advantage over subunit vaccines that they better mimic the natural way of infection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Moreover, their self-propagation is an advantage since only low amounts of the recombinant carrier are necessary for immunization.</p>Vaccines can also be based upon host cells as described above, that comprise the protein or immunogenic fragments thereof according to the invention.</p>All vaccines described above contribute to active vaccination, i.e. they trigger the host's defense system.</p>Alternatively, antibodies can be raised in e.g. rabbits or can be obtained from antibody-producing cell lines as described below. Such antibodies can then be administered to the pig. This method of vaccination, passive vaccination, is the vaccination of choice when an animal is already infected, and there is no time to allow the natural immune response to be tri",
    " delivery system are attenuated live bacteria such as Salmonella species, and attenuated live viruses such as Herpesvirus vectors, as mentioned above.</p>Still other forms of this embodiment relate to vaccines comprising recombinant DNA molecules according to the invention.</p>DNA vaccines can e.g. easily be administered through intradermal application such as by using a needle-less injector. This way of administration delivers the DNA directly into the cells of the animal to be vaccinated. Amounts of DNA in the range between 10 pg and 1000 \u03bcg provide good results. Preferably, amounts in the microgram range between 1 and 100 \u03bcg are used.</p>In a further embodiment, the vaccine according to the present invention additionally comprises one or more antigens derived from pig pathogenic organisms and viruses, antibodies against those antigens or genetic information encoding such antigens. Of course, such antigens can be e.g. other Brachyspira hyodysenteriae antigens. It can also be an antigen selected from another other pig pathogenic organism or virus. Such organisms and viruses are preferably selected from the group of Pseudorabies virus, Porcine influenza virus, Porcine parvo virus, Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus, Rotavirus, Escherichia coli, Erysipelo rhusiopathiae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Salmonella cholerasuis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.</p>Vaccines based upon the 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein are also very suitable as marker vaccines. A marker vaccine is a \n\n vaccine that allows to discriminate between vaccinated and field-infected pigs e.g. on the basis of a characteristic antibody panel, different from the antibody panel induced by wild type infection. A different antibody panel is induced e.g. when an immunogenic protein present on a wild type bacterium is not present in a vaccine: the host will then not make antibodies against that protein after vaccination. Thus, a vaccine based upon the 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein according to the invention would only induce antibodies against the 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein, whereas a vaccine based upon a live wild-type, live attenuated or inactivated whole Brachyspira hyodysenteriae would induce antibodies against all or most of the bacterial proteins.</p>A simple ELISA test, having wells comprising e.g. the purified recombinant nucleoprotein and wells comprising only purified 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein suffices to test serum from pigs and to tell if the pigs are either vaccinated with the 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein vaccine or suffered from Brachyspiral field infection.</p>All vaccines according to the present invention comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be e.g. sterile water or a sterile physiological salt solution. In a more complex form the carrier can e.g. be a buffer.</p>Methods for the preparation of a vaccine comprise the admixing of a protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof, according to the invention and/or antibodies against that protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof, and/or a nucleic acid sequence and/or a DNA fragment, a recombinant DNA molecule, a live recombinant carrier or host cell according to the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\nVaccines according to the present invention may in a preferred presentation also contain an immunostimulatory substance, a so-called adjuvant. Adjuvants in general comprise substances that boost the immune response of the host in a non-specific manner. A number of different adjuvants are known in the art. Examples of adjuvants frequently used in pig vaccines are muramyldipeptides, lipopolysaccharides, several glucans and glycans and Carbopol(^) (a homopolymer).</p>The vaccine may also comprise a so-called \"vehicle\". A vehicle is a compound to which the protein adheres, without being covalently bound to it. Such vehicles are i.a. bio-microcapsules, micro-alginates, liposomes and macrosols, all known in the art.</p>A special form of such a vehicle,",
    "re understood to have a length of at least 12 nucleotides and a homology of at least 70%, more preferably 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or even 100%, in that order of preference, with the nucleic acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO 3. Such nucleic acid sequences can be used as primer fragments in PCR- reactions in order to enhance the amount of DNA that they encode or in hybridization reactions. This allows the quick amplification or detection on blots of specific nucleotide sequences for use as a diagnostic tool for e.g. the detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae as indicated above.</p>Another test on genetic material is based upon growth of bacterial material obtained from e.g. a swab, followed by classical DNA purification followed by classical hybridization with radioactively or color-labeled primer fragments. Colour-labelled and radioactively labeled fragments are generally called detection means. Both PCR-reactions and hybridization reactions are well-known in the art and are i.a. described in Maniatis/Sambrook (Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. ISBN 0-87969-309-6).</p>Thus, one embodiment of the invention relates to a diagnostic test kit for the detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae nucleic acid sequences. Such a test comprises a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention or a primer fragment thereof. \n\nA diagnostic test kit based upon the detection of antigenic material of the specific Brachyspira hyodysenteriae 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein and therefore suitable for the detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infection may i.a. comprise a standard ELISA test. In one example of such a test the walls of the wells of an ELISA plate are coated with antibodies directed against the 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein. After incubation with the material to be tested, labeled anti- Brachyspira hyodysenteriae antibodies are added to the wells. A color reaction then reveals the presence of antigenic material from Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Therefore, still another embodiment of the present invention relates to diagnostic test kits for the detection of antigenic material of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Such test kits comprise antibodies against a 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein or a fragment thereof according to the invention.</p>A diagnostic test kit based upon the detection in serum of antibodies against the 61 kD and/or 20 kD lipoprotein of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and therefore suitable for the detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infection may i.a. comprise a standard ELISA test. In such a test the walls of the wells of an ELISA plate can e.g. be coated with the 61 kD or 20 kD lipoprotein. After incubation with the material to be tested, labeled anti-61 kD or 20 kD antibodies are added to the wells. A lack of color reaction then reveals the presence of antibodies against Brachyspira hyodysenteriae.</p>Therefore, still another embodiment of the present invention relates to diagnostic test kits for the detection of antibodies against Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Such test kits comprise the 61 kD and/or 20 kD Brachyspira hyodysenteriae lipoprotein or a fragment thereof according to the invention.</p>The design of the immunoassay may vary. For example, the immunoassay may be based upon competition or direct reaction. Furthermore, protocols may use \n\nsolid supports or may use cellular material. The detection of the antibody-antigen complex may involve the use of labeled antibodies; the labels may be, for example, enzymes, fluorescent-, chemoluminescent-, radio-active- or dye molecules. Suitable methods for the detection of antibodies reactive with a protein according to the present invention in the sample include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescense test (IFT) and Western blot analysis.</p>The proteins or immunogenic fragments thereof according to the invention e.g. expressed as indicated above can be used to produce antibodies, which may be polyclonal, monospecific or monoclonal (or derivatives thereof). If polyclonal antibodies are desired, techniques for producing and processing polyclonal sera are well-known in the art (e.g. Mayer and Walter, eds. Immunochemical Methods in Cell and Molecular Biology, Academic Press, London, 1987). Monoclonal antibodies, reactive against the protein according to the invention or an immunogenic fragment thereof according to the present invention, can be prepared by immunizing inbred mice by techniques also known in the art (Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256, 495-497, 1975). \n\n</p>Examples</p>Example 1</p>Bacterial st",
    "ions. The restriction enzyme was removed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. 5\u03bcg of the digested chromosomal DNA was mixed with 0.1 \u03bcg of Hindlll digested pBluescript II SK (Stratagene Co.). To this mixture 5 units of T4 DNA ligase (Gibco-BRL) was added and incubated for 18 hours at 14\u00b0C. E. coli strain DH5\u03b1 was made competent (Hanahan) and transformed with 10 \u03bcl of the ligation mix and after recovery for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in Luria Bertani broth the mixture was plated on Luria Bertani plates supplemented with 100\u03bcg/ml of ampicillin. A total of &gt;4000 colonies was obtained. A total of 4000 colonies from the obtained Hindlll library were plated on LB plates with 100\u03bcg/ml of ampicillin and grown for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C. Colonies were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters, fixed in chloroform vapor and then lysed with SDS using standard methods (Sambrook et al). The obtained filters were incubated with serum obtained from a pig with \u03b2. hyodysenteriae infection. The colony blots were developed with rabbit-anti pig \n\n alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies. Colonies reacting with the convalescent serum were purified and plasmid DNA was extracted from cultures grown in LB medium with 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin. Clone HBA3 was shown to contain an 1.8 kb Hindlll insert from which the sequence was determined. An ORF of 1614 bp was identified (SEQ ID NO 1 ) which encodes a lipoprotein designated BlpB (SEQ ID NO 2). The lipoprotein has a calculated molecular mass of 60.8 kD.</p>Construction and screening of Blue Halo libraries Genomic libraries of \u03b2. hyodysenteriae (B204) were constructed using the signal peptide deficient alkaline phosphatase vector, pMG (Giladi et al, 1993). A mixture of pMG 1c, 2.7 and 3.29 vectors were digested with Smal to allow cloning in all three reading frames. Aliquots of genomic DNA were completely digested with Alu\\ and Rsa\\ and ligated to alkaline phosphatase-treated vectors. Electrocompetent E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells were transformed with the ligation mix, incubated with shaking for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C to allow expression, and then plated onto LB agar containing ampicillin, 1 mM IPTG and 40 \u03bcg/ml XP (5-Bromo-4- chloro-3-indoyl phosphate) to identify blue colonies, containing inserts partially encoding membrane and exported proteins. Approximately 1700 recombinants were obtained, of which 23 exhibited the blue phenotype. Transformation of the plasmid DNA from the 23 blue colonies into E. coli KSS330r<sup>\"</sup> and plating on to 1 mM IPTG and 200 \u03bcg/ml XP media resulted in 5 colonies expressing the blue halo phenotype. Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies expressing the blue halo phenotype and used as template in PCRs with vector primers which flank the polylinker, in order to determine the size of the plasmid inserts. Sequence analysis with one of the vector primers on the obtained plasmids resulted in the 5'end of the blpC gene. The remainder of the gene sequence was obtained by SSP-PCR (Shyamala &amp; Ames, Gene 84, 1-8, 1989). An ORF of 537 bp was \n\n identified (SEQ ID NO 3) which encodes a lipoprotein designated BlpC (SEQ ID NO 4). The lipoprotein has a calculated molecular mass of 20 kD.</p>Example 2</p>Expression of BlpB and BlpC in E. coli</p>PCR was used to amplify the genes encoding the mature length proteins BlpB and BlpC using primers designed to engineer unique restriction endonuclease sites into the final product. The 5' primers incorporate either an Nde\\ site or a \u03b2amHI site. The 3' primers incorporate a BamHI site or an A/del site. An aliquot of the PCR products were visualized on an agarose gel and the remaining portions were digested with \u03b2amHI (Roche) and/or Nde\\ (Roche) according to manufactures instructions. Restriction endonuclease were inactivated by phenol extraction and the digested PCR products were purified by ethanol precipitation. The pET-15b vector was digested and purified as per the PCR products and treated with alkaline phosphatase. 150\u03bcg of the digested PCR products were ligated into 80 ng of digested pET15-b using T4 DNA ligase (Roche) according to manufactures instructions. The ligations were transformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1. Clones containing single inserts were identified using colony PCR with primers designed to flank the multicloning site of the vector: 5'-TAA-TAC-GAC-TCA-CTA- TAG-G-3' and 5'-GGA-AAC-AGC-TAT-GAC-CAT-G-3'. For each ligation the insert of one of the clones was checked by double stranded DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clone and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. To check expression of recombinant proteins whole cell lysates of the induced cultures of the e"
