    "d from mice treated with control or glucagon receptor antisense compounds. <sup>125</sup>I-glucagon binding was effectively competed by increasing concentrations of unlabeled glucagon in control membrane samples. 15-20 \u03bcg of membrane from control oligonucleotide- or glucagon receptor oligonucleotide (ISIS 180475; SEQ ID NO: 452) -treated db/db mice were incubated with 0.1 nM <sup>X2S</sup>I-glucagon (2000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled glucagon (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) . Assays were performed under steady state conditions in the presence of excess labeled ligand on 96-well MultiScreen-HV 0.45 \u03bcm filter plates (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA) . Following incubation for 2 hrs at room temperature, plates were rapidly washed by filtration with ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and dried for 45 min at 50\u00b0C. Following the addition of Optiphase Supermix (PerkinElmer) , plates were counted on a Wallac Microbeta scintillation counter. Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software and expressed as mean +/- SEM. Data obtained for samples from animals treated with glucagon receptor oligonucleotide neared the limits of detection for the assay and curve- fitting parameters. In order to derive a numerical value for apparent Bmax, the Kd was fixed at the average value (0.69 +/- 0.2 nM) obtained from the samples from the control antisense-treated animals.</p>\n  Functional GCGR expression was found to be decreased approximately 85% by glucagon receptor antisense treatment and is in accord with quantitative RT-PCR results . \n\nExample 25</p>\n  Antisense inhibitors of human and monkey glucagon receptor- dose response Based on the screen in Example 15 above, a subset of human glucagon receptor antisense oligonucleotides were chosen for further study. Dose-response studies were conducted for ISIS 315186, 310457, 315324, 315278, 315181, 315297, 315163 and 310456 in both human HepG2 cell cultures and in cynomolgus monkey primary hepatocytes . These six compounds are homologous to both human and cynomolgus monkey glucagon receptor nucleic acid targets. The universal control ISIS 29848 (NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN; SEQ ID NO : 820, where N is an equimolar mixture of A, C, G and T, a chimeric 2' MOE gapmer with a phosphorothioate backbone and with MOEs at positions 1-5 &amp; 16-20) was used as negative control.</p>\n  The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) . HepG2 cells are routinely cultured in</p>\n  Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, non- essential amino acids, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco/Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) . Cells are routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reach 90% confluence.</p>\n  Primary cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes were obtained from CellzDirect (Los Angeles) and plated onto collagen- coated 24-well plates (Costar) at a density of 75,000 cells/well. The culturing medium for these hepatocytes was William's E media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) . Cells were allowed to attach overnight and were then treated with oligonucleotide-Lipofectin mixture for 4 hours. The oligonucleotide-Lipofectin \n\nmixture was washed off and then cells were incubated in normal medium.</p>\n  Cells were treated with oligonucleotide for 20 hours at doses of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 nM for HepG2 cells and 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 nM for primary monkey hepatocytes (n=3) . RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR to determine percent inhibition of glucagon receptor expression compared to control (ISIS 29848) , at each oligonucleotide concentration. The results were plotted to give the IC50, the dose of oligonucleotide which results in 50% reduction of glucagon receptor mRNA levels. Results are shown in Table 6.</p>\n  Table 6 IC50s of glucagon receptor antisense oligonucleotides in human HepG2 cells and in cynomolgus monkey primary \u03b9 hepatocytes (in nM)</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000107_0001\" path=\"imgf000107_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/3847917/WO/20041111/A2/002004/09/60/16/imgf000107_0001.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n  Based on these results, three compounds (ISIS 315297, 310457 and 315163) were chosen for study in monkeys.</p>\n  Example 26 \n\nDose-ranging study of antisense inhibition of glucagon receptor expression in cynomolgus monkeys</p>\n  A monkey study was performed at SNBL USA, Ltd. , Everett, WA . Forty mature (6-8 years old) male Macaca fascicularis (purpose-bred cynomolgus monkeys) weighing approximately 5-10 kg at the initiation of dosing were used. The animals were individually housed in primary climate-controlled enclosures conforming to the Animal Welfare Act. Animals were offered Purina Mills Laboratory Profiled Fiber Plus\u00ae Monkey Diet (Animal</p>\n  Specialties, Hubbard, OR) . Occasional fresh fruit and vegetable treats were also offered. Fresh drinking water was available to all animals, ad libitum. Before fasting measurements, food was removed from enclosures between 1630 and 1700 on the afternoon before the scheduled blood draw. After the animals were fasted for at least 16 hours, blood samples for plasma analysis were col"
