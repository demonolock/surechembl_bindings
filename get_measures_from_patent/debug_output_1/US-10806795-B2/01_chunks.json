Such a BBB-shuttle module recognizes a transcytoseable cell surface target on the blood brain barrier (such as TfR, LRPs or other targets, BBBR) and simultaneously binds to haptenylated payloads.</p>It has been found that no further requirements with respect to binding valency, antibody format, BBBR binding affinities have to be met.</p>It has further been found that it is not required that the bispecific antibody-based shuttle module as reported herein is released from t",

    "and resulting disorder in the crystal. However, the linker and Cy5 are attached to 032 of digoxigenin which points into the direction of the CDR2 of the heavy chain. The distance between 032 of digoxigenin to the Cu of the amino acid residue in position 52b according to Kabat is about 10.5 \u212b.</p>It has been found that the positions are \u201cuniversal\u201d position, i.e. the position is applicable to any (anti-hapten) antibody or any helicarylated payload, respectively, and, thus, it is not required to start from scratch every time a new covalent complex has to be generated e.g. by providing the crystal structure and determining the appropriate position that enables hapten-positioned covalent coupling.</p>The antibodies modified as reported herein retain the hapten (antigen) binding capability of their parent (i.e. wild-type) antibody counterparts. Thus, the engineered antibody is capable of binding, in one embodiment it is capable of specifically binding, to haptens (antigens).</p>The terms \u201cbinding site that specifically binds to\u201d or \u201can antibody that specifically binds to\u201d denote that the molecule comprising the binding site or an antibody can form a complex with a further molecule in a specific manner. The binding can be detected in an in vitro assay, such as in a plasmon resonance assay (BIAcore, GE-Healthcare Uppsala, Sweden). The affinity of the complex formation is defined by the terms ka (rate constant for the association of the compounds to form the complex), k<sub>D </sub>(dissociation constant, dissociation of the complex), and K<sub>D </sub>(k<sub>D</sub>/ka). Binding or specifically binding means a binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less.</p>It has been found that the formation of a covalent bond between a cysteine-modified antibody and a cysteine-modified haptenylated payload bearing the cysteine residue in the linker between the hapten and the payload or within the hapten or within the payload takes place upon binding of the antibody to the haptenylated payload without the requirement of the addition of reducing and/or oxidizing agents if the formed bond is a disulfide bond. Thus, the disulfide bridge between the two compounds is formed spontaneously upon formation of the non-covalent complex. Therefore, a method for the formation of a covalent complex as reported herein simply requires the mixing of the two compounds. The only pre-requisite for the formation of the disulfide bond is a proper orientation of the two compounds with respect to each other.</p>Replacement of the amino acid residue at position VH52b and VH53, respectively, (according to the Kabat numbering scheme) with a Cys residue resulted in antibody derivatives with heavy chain variable region sequences that are listed in SEQ ID NO: 20 and 28 for anti-digoxigenin antibody-VH52bC, in SEQ ID NO: 84 and 92 for anti-theophylline antibody-VH53C, in SEQ ID NO: 52 and 60 for anti-biotin antibody-VH53C, in SEQ ID NO: 108 for anti-fluorescein antibody-VH52",

The results of these experiments also show that the payload can become released from the shuttle vehicle and subsequently bind to and accumulate on its target in the brain.</p>Antibody Affinity</p>In certain embodiments, the antibody as reported herein itself or the antibody in the complex as reported herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u226410 nM, \u22641 nM, \u22640.1 nM, \u22640.01 nM, or \u22640.001 nM (e.g. of about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, e.g. from about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M to about 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M, e.g., from about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M to about 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen, Y. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293 (1999) 865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER\u00ae multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta, L. G. et al., Cancer Res. 57 (1997) 4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u00ae) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bcl/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20\u2122; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p>According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u221210 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (about 0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block non-reacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen, Y. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293 (1999) 865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 106 M<sup>\u22121 </sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p>Antibody Fragments</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein or in a conjugate as reported herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032, Fab\u2032-SH, F(ab\u2032)2, Fv, and scFv fragments and conjugates thereof, and other fragments described below as long as the fragments are bivalent and bispecific or are combined to form a bivalent bispecific antibody fragment fusion polypeptide.

Around 4300 resonance units (RU) of the capturing system (10 \u03bcg/ml Anti-human Capture (IgG Fc) from Human Antibody Capture Kit, BR-1008-39, GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Sweden) were coupled on a CM3 chip (GE Healthcare, BR-1005-36) at pH 5.0 by using the standard amine coupling kit supplied by GE Healthcare (BR-1000-50). The running buffer for amine coupling was HBS-N (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, GE Healthcare, BR-1006-70). Running and dilution buffer for the followed binding study was PBS-T (10 mM phosphate buffered saline including 0.05% Tween 20) pH 7.4. The humanized anti-biotin antibody was captured by injecting a 2 nM solution for 60 sec at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min. Biotinylated siRNA was diluted with PBS-T at concentrations of 0.14-100 nM (1:3 dilution series). Binding was measured by injecting each concentration for 180 sec at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min, dissociation time 600 sec. The surface was regenerated by 30 sec washing with a 3 M MgCl<sub>2 </sub>solution at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min. The data were evaluated using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Sweden). Bulk refractive index differences were corrected by subtracting the response obtained from an anti-human IgG Fc surface. Blank injections were also subtracted (=double referencing). For calculation of KD and kinetic parameters the Langmuir 1:1 model was used.</p>Kinetic binding analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was carried out for humanized anti-biotin antibody SEQ ID NO: 44 and 48 and humanized anti-biotin antibody VH53C SEQ ID NO: 60 and 64. Anti-biotin antibodies at a concentration of 2 nM were captured by anti-human IgG Fc antibody which was bound to a CM3 sensor chip. Binding of biotinylated siRNA (Mw: 13868 Da) was recorded at the concentrations 0.41, 1.23, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 nM. Measurements were carried out in duplicates. The calculated K<sub>D </sub>for humanized anti-biotin antibody and humanized anti-biotin antibody VH53C were 0.633 nM and 0.654 nM, respectively.</p>Example 10Generation of Non-Covalent Complexes of Haptenylated Compounds with Anti-Hapten Antibodies</p>General Method:</p>The generation of complexes of anti-hapten antibodies with haptenylated compounds (=haptens conjugated to a payload) shall result in defined complexes and it shall be assure that the compound (=payload) in these complexes retains its activity. For the generation of complexes of haptenylated compounds with the respective anti-hapten antibody the haptenylated compound was dissolved in H20 to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The antibody was concentrated to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (4.85 \u03bcM) in 20 mM histidine buffer, 140 mM NaCl, pH=6.0. Haptenylated payload and antibody were mixed to a 2:1 molar ratio (compound to antibody) by pipetting up and down and"
