    "btain the cGB domain of PDE5 with forward and reverse primers designed from bovine PDE5A cDNA sequence (McAllister-Lucas L.</p>\n  M. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22863-22873, 1993) and the selection among PDE 1-10 families. 5'-3', Inc. kits for total RNA followed by oligo (dT) column purification of inRNA are used with HT-29 cells. Forward primer (GAA-TTC-TGT-TAG-AAA- AGC-CAC-CAG-AGA-AAT-G, 203-227) and reverse primer (CTC-GAG-CTC- TCT-TGT-TTC-TTC-CTC-TGC-TG, 1664-1686) are used to synthesize the 1484 bp fragment coding for the phosphorylation site and both low and high affinity cGMP binding sites of human PDE5A (203-1686 bp, cGB-PDE5). The synthesized cGB- PDE5 nucleotide fragment codes for 494 amino acids with 97% similarity to bovine PDE5A. It is then cloned into pGEX-5X-3 glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion vector (Pharmacia Biotech )with tac promoter, and EcoRI and Xhol cut sites. The \n\nfusion vector is then transfected into E. Coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria (Invitrogen). The transfected BL21 bacteria are grown to log phase and then IPTG is added as an inducer. The induction is carried out at 20\u00b0C for 24 hrs. The bacteria are harvested and lysed. The soluble cell lysate is incubated with GSH conjugated Sepharose 4B (GSH-Sepharose 4B). The GST-cGB-PDE5 fusion protein can bind to the GSH-</p>\n  Sepharose beads ,and the other proteins are washed off from the beads with excessive cold PBS.</p>\n  The expressed GST-cGB-PDE5 fusion protein is displayed on 7.5% SDS- PAGE gel as a 85 Kd protein. It is characterized by its cGMP binding and phosphorylation by protein kinases G and A. It displays two cGMP binding sites and the KJ is 1.6+0.2 \u03bcM, which is close to \n<img id=\"imgf000043_0001\" path=\"imgf000043_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2495839/WO/20020530/A1/002002/04/19/14/imgf000043_0001.tif\"/>\n \u03bcM of the native bovine PDE5. The GST-cGB-PDE5 on GSH conjugated sepharose beads can be phosphorylated in vitro by cGMP-dependent protein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. The K<sub>m</sub> of GST-cGB-PDE5 phosphorylation by PKG is 2.7\u03bcM and the Vmax is 2.8 \u03bcM, while the K<sub>m</sub> of BPDEtide phosphorylation is 68\u03bcM. The phosphorylation by PKG shows molecular phosphate incorporated into GST-cGB-PDE5 protein on a one-to- one ratio.</p>\n  To assay a liquid sample believed to contain PKG using the PDE5-bound solid phase described above, the sample and the solid phase are mixed with phosphorylation buffer containing <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP. The solution is incubated for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C to allow for phosphorylation of the PDE5 sequence by PKG to occur, if PKG is present. The solid phase is then separated from solution (e.g., by centrifugation or filtration) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (\"PBS\") to remove any remaining solution and to remove any unreacted <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP. The solid phase can then be tested directly (e.g., by liquid scintillation counter) to ascertain whether <sup>32</sup>P is incorporated. If <sup>32</sup>P is incorporated, that indicates that the sample contained PKG since PKG phosphorylates PDE5. If the PDE5 is bound via fusion protein, as described above, the PDE5 -containing fusion protein can be eluted from the solid phase with SDS buffer, and the eluent can be assayed for <sup>32</sup>P incorporation. This is particularly advantageous if there is the possibility that other \n\nproteins are present, since the eluent can be processed (e.g., by gel separation) to separate various proteins from each other so that the fusion protein fraction can be assayed for <sup>32</sup>P incorporation. The phosphorylated fusion protein can be eluted from the solid phase with SDS buffer and further resolved by electrophoresis. If gel separation is performed, the proteins can be stained to see the position(s) of the protein, and <sup>32</sup>P phosphorylation of the PDE5 portion of the fusion protein by PKG can be measured by exposure of the gel to X-ray film. If P is made visible on X-ray film, that indicates that the original sample contained PKG, which phosphorylated the PDE5 portion of the fusion protein eluted from the solid phase. Preferably in the assay, one should add to the assay buffer an excess (e.g., 100 fold of IC<sub>50</sub> value) of protein kinase inhibitor (\"PKI\") which specifically and potently inhibits protein kinase A (\"PKA\") without inhibiting PKG. Inhibiting PKA is desirable since it may contribute to the phosphorylation of the PKG substrate (e.g., PDE5). By adding PKI, any contribution to phosphorylation by PKA will be eliminated, and any phosphorylation detected is highly likely to be due to PKG alone.</p>\n  A kit can be made for the assay of this invention, which kit contains the following pre-packaged reagents in separate containers:</p>\n  1. Cell lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, ImM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM NaF, 500\u03bcM IBMX, proteinase inhibitors. 2. Protein kinase G solid phase substrate: recombinant GST-cGB-PDE5 bound Sepharose 4B (50% slurry).</p>\n  3. 2x Phosphorylation buffer: <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP (3000 mCi/mmol, 5-10 \u03bcCi/assay), 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 200 \u03bcM ATP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2.</sub></p>\n  4. PKA Protein Kinase I Inhibitor Disposable containers and the like in which to perform the above reactions can also be provided in the kit.</p>\n  From the above, one skilled in the analytical arts will readily envision various ways to adapt the assay formats described to still other formats. In short, using at least a portion of PDE5 (or any other protein that can be selectively phosphorylated by PKG), the presence and relative amount (as compared to a control) of PKG can be \n\nascertained by evaluating phosphorylation of the phosphorylatable protein, using a labeled phosphorylation agent.</p>\n  SAANDs Increase PKG Activity In Neoplastic Cells Using the PKG assay described above, the following experiments were performed to establish that SAANDs incre",
    "ith and without added cGMP, one can ascertain whether the PKG activity increase, if any, is due to increased PKG expression. Thus, if an anti-neoplastic drug elevates PKG activity relative to control, one can establish if the drug-induced increase is due to increased PKG protein expression (as opposed to activation) in the drag-treated sample if (1) the drag-treated sample with extra cGMP exhibits greater PKG activity compared to the control sample with extra cGMP, and (2) the drug-treated sample without extra cGMP exhibits greater PKG activity relative to control. \n\n After parallel samples with and without added cGMP are prepared, 50 \u03bcL of each cell lysate is added to 20 \u03bcL of the PDE5/GST solid phase substrate slurry described above. For each control or drug cell lysate sample to be evaluated, the reaction is started by adding phosphorylation buffer containing 10 \u03bcCi <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP solution (200 \u03bcM ATP, 4.5 mM MgCl; 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 5 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>;) to each mixture. The resultant mixtures are incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The mixtures are then centrifuged to separate the solid phase, and the supernatant is discarded. The solid phase in each tube is washed with 700 \u03bcL cold PBS. To the solid phase, Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) (30 \u03bcL) is added. The mixtures are boiled for 5 minutes, and loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel is ran at 150 V for one hour.</p>\n  The bands obtained are stained with commassie blue to visualize the 85 Kd GST- PDE5 fusion protein bands, if present. The gel is dried, and the gel is laid on x-ray film which, if the PDE5 is phosphorylated, the film will show a corresponding darkened band. The darkness of each band relates to the degree of phosphorylation. As shown in Figures 18A and 18B, the SAAND exisulind causes PKG activity to increase in a dose-dependent manner in both the samples with added cGMP and without added cGMP relative to the control samples with and without extra cGMP. This is evidenced by the darker appearances of the 85 Kd bands in each of the drag- treated samples. In addition, the SW480 samples treated with exisulind show a greater PKG phosphorylation activity with added cGMP in the assay relative to the samples treated with vehicle with added cGMP. Thus, the increase in PKG activity in the drug-treated samples is not due only to the activation of PKG by the increase in cellular cGMP when the SAAND inhibits cGMP-specific PDE, the increase in PKG activity in neoplasia harboring the APC mutation is due to increased PKG expression as well.</p>\n  Also the fact that the E4021 -treated SW480 samples do not exhibit PKG activation relative to control (see Figures 18A and 18B) shows that the increased PKG activation caused by SAANDs in neoplasia containing the APC mutation is not simply due to inhibition of classic PDE5. \n\n As an analytic technique for evaluating PKG activation, instead of x-ray film exposure as described above, the 85 Kd band from the SDS page can be evaluated for the degree of phosphorylation by cutting the band from the gel, and any <sup>32</sup>P incorporated in the removed band can be counted by scintillation (beta) counter in the <sup>32</sup>P window.</p>\n  To test the effect of cGMP-specific PDE inhibition on neoplasia containing . the \u03b2-catenin mutation, HCT116 colon cancer cells were employed. HCT116 is known to contain the \u03b2-catenin mutation, but is known not to contain the APC mutation. The same procedure is used to grow the HCT116 cells as is used in the SW480 procedure described above, hi this experiment, only exisulind and controls were used. The exisulind-treated cells yielded PKG that was phosphorylated to a greater extent than the corresponding controls, indicating that PKG activation occurred in the drug-treated cells that is independent of the APC mutation. Thus, for the purposes of the present invention, \"\u03b2-catenin\" refers to wild type and/or mutant forms of that protein.</p>\n  Confirmation of Increased PKG Expression and Decreased \u03b2-Catenin In SW 480 By Western Blot As demonstrated above, SAANDs cause an increase in PKG expression and an increase in cGMP level, both of which cause an increase in PKG activity in SAANDs- treated neoplastic cells. This increase in PKG protein expression was further verified by relatively quantitative western blot, as described below.</p>\n  SW480 cells treated with exisulind as described previously are harvested from the microfuge tubes by",
    "Western blot analysis demonstrated that expression of \u03b2- catenin was reduced by 50 % in the exisulind-treated cells as compared to control. These results indicate that \u03b2-catenin is reduced by SAANDs treatment. Together with the results above, establishing PKG activity increases with such treatment, and the results below, establishing that \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated by PKG, these results indicate that the reduction of \u03b2-catenin in neoplastic cells is initiated by activation of \n\nPKG. Thus, using PKG activity in neoplasia as a screening tool to select compounds as anti-neoplasties is useful.</p>\n  The Phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin By PKG In vitro, PKG phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin. The experiment that established this involves immunoprecipitating the \u03b2-catenin-containing complex from SW480 cells (not treated with any drag) in the manner described below under \"\u03b2-catenin immunoprecipitation.\" The immunoprecipitated complex, while still trapped on the solid phase (i.e., beads) is mixed with <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP and pure PKG (100 units). Corresponding controls without added PKG are prepared.</p>\n  The protein is released from the solid phase by SDS buffer, and the protein- containing mixture is run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The running of the mixture on the gel removes excess <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP from the mixture. Any <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP detected in the 93Kd \u03b2-catenin band, therefore, is due to the phosphorylation of the \u03b2-catenin. Any increase in <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP detected in the 93 Kd \u03b2-catenin band treated with extra PKG relative to the control without extra PKG, is due to the phosphorylation of the \u03b2- catenin in the treated band by the extra PKG.</p>\n  The results we obtained were that there was a noticeable increase in phosphorylation in the band treated with PKG as compared to the control, which exhibited minimal, virtually undetectable phosphorylation. This result indicates that \u03b2-catenin can be phosphorylated by PKG.</p>\n  The Phosphorylation of Mutant \u03b2-catenin By PKG</p>\n  The same procedure described in the immediately preceding section was performed with HCT116 cells, which contain no APC mutation, but contain a \u03b2- catenin mutation. The results of those experiments also indicate that mutant \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated by PKG.</p>\n  Thus, for the purposes of the present invention, the phosphorylation of \u03b2- catenin refers to the phosphorylation of wild type and/or mutant forms of that protein. \n\n\u03b2-Catenin Precipitates With PKG</p>\n  Supernatants of both SW480 and HCT116 cell lysates are prepared in the same way described above in the Western Blot experiments. The cell lysates are pre- cleared by adding 150 :1 of protein A Sepharose bead slurry (50%) per 500 :g of cell lysate and incubating at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes on a tube shaker. The protein A beads are removed by centrifugation at 14,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The supernatants are transferred to a fresh centrifuge tubes. 10 :g of the rabbit polyclonal anti- \u03b2-catenin antibody (Upstate Biotec",
    " in-house capabilities, hi short, one skilled in the art can readily produce many compounds for screening from which to select promising compounds for treatment of neoplasia having the attributes of compounds disclosed herein. h addition, there are a number of commercially-known libraries of compounds usually made with combinatorial techniques. Such compounds can first be assessed using the types of software explained above to ascertain whether they are conformationally similar to active compounds of the types disclosed herein. After identifying such conformationally similar compounds, the compounds can readily be screened according to the methods of this invention to yield anti-neoplastic cGMP</p>\n  PDE inhibitors.</p>\n  To further assist in identifying compounds that can be screened and then selected using the criterion of this invention, knowing the binding of selected antineoplastic compounds to PDE5 protein is of interest. By the procedures discussed below, it was found that preferable, desirable compounds meeting the selection criteria of this invention bind to the cGMP catalytic region of PDE5.</p>\n  To establish this, a PDE5 sequence that does not include the catalytic domain was used. One way to produce such a sequence is to express that sequence as a fusion protein, preferably with glutathione S-transferase (\"GST\"). Production of a GST- cGB-PDE5 fusion protein was carried out by the procedure described above in the section entitled The Novel PKG Assay.</p>\n  A cGMP binding assay for compounds of interest (Francis S. H. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 255, 620-626, 1980) is done in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL containing 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH=6.8), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mg/mL BSA, H<sup>3</sup>-cGMP (2\u03bcM, NEN) and the GST-cGB-PDE5 fusion protein (30 \u03bcg /assay). Each compound \n\nto be tested is added at the same time as <sup>3</sup>H-cGMP substrate, and the mixture is incubated at 22\u00b0C for 1 hour. Then, the mixture is transferred to Brandel MB-24 cell harvester with GF/B as the filter membrane followed by 2 washes with 10 mL of cold 5 mM potassium buffer (pH 6.8). The membranes are then cut out and transferred to scintillation vials followed by the addition of 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and 6 mL of Ready Safe\u2122 liquid scintillation cocktail to each vial. The vials are counted on a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter.</p>\n  For calculation, blank samples are prepared by boiling the binding protein for 5 minutes, and the binding counts are &lt; 1% when compared to unboiled protein. The quenching by filter membrane or other debris are also calibrated.</p>\n  PDE5 inhibitors, sulfide, exisulind, Compound B, Compound E, E4021 and zaprinast, and cyclic nucleotide analogs, cAMP, cyclic IMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, cyclic UMP, cyclic CMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, 2'-O-butyl-cGMP and 2'-O-butyl-cAMP are selected to test whether they could competitively bind to the cGMP binding sites of the GST-cGB-PDE5 protein.
