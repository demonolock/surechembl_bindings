    " the expressions \u201cthe subject is ANLN protein negative\u201d and \u201cthe cancer of the subject is ANLN protein negative\u201d may be used interchangeably.</p>In embodiments of the endocrine treatment product aspects, the endocrine treatment product may be selected from a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), an aromatase, and a steroidal estrogen receptor antagonist. The SERM may be e.g. toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, arzoxifene or tamoxifene. The aromatase inhibitor may be e.g. anastrozole, letrozole och exemestane. Further, the steroidal estrogen receptor antagonist may be fulvestrant. Preferably, the endocrine treatment product is a SERM, such as a SERM selected from toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, arzoxifene or tamoxifene. For example, in embodiments of the endocrine treatment product aspects, the endocrine treatment may be tamoxifen.</p>In all embodiments of all the above aspects involving an endocrine treatment, the endocrine treatment may be a SERM treatment, such as a tamoxifen treatment, e.g., of a mammalian subject having a hormone receptor positive, such ER positive and/or PR positive, breast cancer.</p>In the context of the present disclosure, \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cselective\u201d interaction of e.g., an affinity ligand with its target or antigen means that the interaction is such that a distinction between specific and non-specific, or between selective and non-selective, interaction becomes meaningful. The interaction between two proteins is sometimes measured by the dissociation constant. The dissociation constant describes the strength of binding (or affinity) between two molecules. Typically the dissociation constant between an antibody and its antigen is from 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M. However, high specificity does not necessarily require high affinity. Molecules with low affinity (in the molar range) for its counterpart have been shown to be as specific as molecules with much higher affinity. In the case of the present disclosure, a specific or selective interaction refers to the extent to which a particular method can be used to determine the presence and/or amount of a specific protein, the target protein or a fragment thereof, under given conditions in the presence of other proteins in a tissue sample or fluid sample of a naturally occurring or processed biological fluid. In other words, specificity or selectivity is the capacity to distinguish between related proteins. Specific and selective are sometimes used interchangeably in the present description. For example, the specificity or selectivity of an antibody may be determined as in Examples, section 2, below, wherein analysis was performed using a protein array set-up and a Western blot. Specificity and selectivity determinations are also described in Nilsson P et al. (2005) Proteomics 5:4327-4337.</p>In the context of the present disclosure, a \u201cmono-specific antibody\u201d is one of a population of polyclonal antibodies which has been affinity purified on its own antigen, thereby separating such mono-specific antibodies from other antiserum proteins and non-specific antibodies.
