    "vated levels are found in a variety of diseases, as well as in response to interferon treatment (Lancet ii,</p>8745, pages 497 - 499, 1981 by A.Schattner, G.Merlin, S.Levin, D.Wallach, T.Hahn and M.Revel and Journal of Interferon Research, volume 1, 1981, pages 587-594, by A .Schattner, G.Merlin, D.Wallach, H. Rosenberg, T.Bino, T.Hahn, S.Levin and M.Revel, respectively). Purthermore, a patent application has been filed protecting the use of such enzyme assays (German application DE 30 15 462, by M. Revel, A. Kimchi, L. Schulman and D. Wallach). The usefulness of the assay for 2 '5' oligo (A) synthetase is limited by the fact that it is indirect, and the biological active species is 2 '5'-oligo (A) itself. The synthetase does not always faithfully reflect the cellular content of 2 '5'-oligo (A), as can be seen from example number 6 of this application.</p>Some attempts have been made to deal with this problem by developing assays for 2,5'-oligo (A) itself. This can be done by measurementjin extracts of ceHs, of the ability of the 2'5'-oligo (A) to inhibit protein synthesis or activate an endonuclease (see Methods in Enzymology, volume 79, 1981, pages 199-208, by  RGWilliams, REBrown, CSGilbert, RRGolgher, DH Wreschner, WKRoberts, RHSilverman and I; M.Kerr). However, these methods are indirect, cumbersome, not suitable for routine analysis, and involve the use of unstable reagents. The Group of Kerr therefore developed improve improvements including a radio-immune and a radio-binding assay (See Methods in Enzymology, volume 79, 1981, pages 216-227, by M.Knight, DHWreschner, RHSilverman and IMKerr). Their radio-immune assay was dependent on the use of an antibody which was insensitive to the presence of the terminal 5 'triphosphat e essential for biological activity. Their radio-binding assay was based on the binding of 2'5'oligo (A) to the above nuclease. This assay has been commercialized by Amersham International, using rabbit reticulocyte lysates as the source of the binding protein. While this assay has a sufficient degree of specificity, it is of limited usefulness because of the use of biochemical preparations which are unstable and need careful handling, because of the presence of degradative enzymes which will preferentially break down the analyte, and because of the finite affinity of the binding protein, which places a limit on the attainable sensitivity. All of the above disadvantages are eliminated in the present invention.</p>In addition to the antibody of the Kerr group mentioned above, monoclonal antibodies have been prepared (\"Monoclonal antibodies to 5 '-triphospho- (2'-5') adenyl adenosine oligonucleotides\" in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States , volume 79, pages 47424746, 1982, by H.Cailla, C. LeBorgne de Kauol, D.Roux, M. Delaage and J. Marti), which are also specific for the 2 '5' linkage, but not for the presence of the terminal 5'-triphosphate, in spite of the promise of the title. The Kerr group used as immunogenic (A2'p) <sub>2</sub> A, oxidized with periodate  to generate a dialdehyde from the 2 'terminal ribose, and cross linked this to bovine serum albumin with the aid of cyanoborohydride. Cailla et al prepared di-succinyl 2'5 'ApA and cross linked this to human serum albumin with the use",
    ".g. proteins, peptides, carbohydrates and phospholipids. The carbodiimide reagent can be 1-ethyl-3- (3 '-dimethylamino propyl) carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3- (3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 1-cyclohexyl-3- (2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide, 1- cyclohexyl-3 (4-diethylaminocyclohexyl) carbodiimide or N.methyl-N, N'di-tert-butylcarbodiimidium tetrafluoroborate or other suitable reagent.</p>After the coupling reaction eg with succinic anhydride, the molecule may have the structure below, where R represents eg an immunogenic protein coupled via an available amino group: </p>The position of the protein is not defined by the reaction conditions, and in principle, any of the succinyl groups could be reacted, or even combinations, when sterically possible. The exact number and positions of the succinyl groups are also not exactly defined by the reaction conditions, and great heterogeneity is therefore possible. In spite of this, antibodies of great homogenity and specificity are obtained by the conditions of this invention.</p>The immunogenic protein may be any suitable protein, such as bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulin of the same or other species as used for the immunization, or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The latter is to be preferred.</p>Any suitable animal can be used for the immunization, such as sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, rats, mice, chickens, as is commonly used. Rats yield the best results. The titer of the antibody in the serum is optimally assayed by the nitrocellulose binding assay described in the examples, using either [ <sup>3</sup> H] -2 '5'-oligo (A) prepared according to a previously published procedure (\"Synthesis of 2' 5 'oligo (A) in extracts of in  terferon-treated Heia cells \", Journal of Biological Chemistry, volume 254, 1979, pages 5058-5064, by MAMinks, S. Benvin, PAMaroney and C. Baglioni) or [ <sup>32</sup> P] -pCp-2 '5' -oligo ( A), labeled by means of the T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction, and commercially available from Amersham International. The maximum titer is reached after two booster injections.</p>The anti-serum so obtained is active at high dilutions (&gt; 50,000-fold), is stable to freezing, thawing and lyophilization, and can thus be packaged, shipped or stored with no difficulty. The serum is also totally free of any 2 '5'oligo (A) degrading activity, especially at the high dilutions used in the assays. This is in contrast to the cell extracts used in the radio-binding assay mentioned above.</p>The 2 '5'-oligo (A) can be extracted from biological material by any of the commonly used extraction procedures for making cell-free extracts, provided care is taken to avoid either degradation or re-synthesis under the extraction conditions. Homogenization with buffered saline may be used, but acid extraction is to be preferred. Optimally, cold trichloracetic acid extraction is used, preferably in the ranks 5-20%. The trichloracetic acid can then be removed by ether extraction, or preferably by freon-octylamine extraction according to a published procedure ('extraction procedures for use prior to HPLC nucleotide analysis using microparticle chemically bonded packings \", Journal of Chromatographie Science, volume 15, 1977 , pages 218-221, by SC.Chen, PRBrown and DMRosie) .This procedure is excellent for all kinds of biological materials, including eultured cells, organs, tissues or any biological fluids such as blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, etc. The extract may be lyophilized to reduce the volume and remove ex  traneous volatile material. If desired, an additional step of chromatography (High Performance Liquid Chromatography or conventional column chromatography) may be used. Stepwize chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose is especially simple and useful for removal of the cellular ATP, which may be at concentrations \u226510 <sup>6</sup> -fold the analyte concentration.</p>According to the invention the resulting specific antibody is",
    " antibody or determination of antibody-ligand interaction by means of a signal which is modulated by the antibody-antigen reaction. Por instance, this can be done either determining the reduction of binding of a known highly radioactive ligand, such as [ <sup>32</sup> P] -pCp-labeled 2 '5' -oligo (A), after binding the antibody-ligand complex to a solid support, such as nitrocellulose. The ligand can be labeled with any suitable radioactive isotope. It is also possible to label the ligand with a fluorescent, enzymatic or luminescent moiety. The assay can also be of the sandwich type, where antibody of one specificity is bound to a solid support, used to bind the unknown analyte, and detected with an antibody of second specificity. Of this pair forming the sandwich, one may be the specific antibody defined by the present invention, and the other may be of the type described by the groups of Kerr or Cailla described above, or directed against the adenosine, as described by Erlanger and Beiser (Proceedings of the National Academy of the United States, volume 52, 1964, pages 68-74). The label need not be in the ligand for any of the above assays, but may be in one of  the antibodies, or in a second antibody directed against one of the primary antibodies, as is well-known in the art.</p>The preferred form of assay for detection of fmoles of 5 '-terminal mono-, di- or tri-phosphorylated (adenylyl-2'-5') <sub>n</sub> adenosine in extracts from biological material is the competition binding assay already mentioned, where the unknown is mixed with a known amount of known radioactive ligand, incubated with a dilution of the antibody, mixed with suitable buffer, poured over nitrocellulose in a filtration apparatus, and the excess unbound ligand removed by washing, and counting in a scintillation counter. The assay is fast and simple, and the reaction is complete in a few minutes at reduced temperature. The assay by reduction of binding of the labeled 2 '5'-oligo (A) is as shown here: </p> Even more sensitive assays can be constructed with the use of labeled antibodies.</p>The main application of such assay at present lie in the field of research into the biochemistry of interferon action, and in the biochemistry of action of hormones, lymphokines, growth factors etc. The wide importance of 2-5'oligo (A) is evidenced by the fact that 2 '5'-oligo (A) synthetase is induced in a variety of Systems other than interferon such as in the differentiating chick oviduct following estrogen withdrawal, as described (\"2-5A synthetase: assay, distribution and variation with growth hormone status \", Nature, volume 278, 1979, pages 471-473, by GR Stark, WJDower, RTSchimke, REBrown and IMKerr), or in Priend Erythroleukemia transformed mouse erythroblasts, triggered into differentiation by various reagents (\" Increased levels of interferon-induced (2 '-5') oligo-iso-adenylate synthetase in mature lymphocytes and in differentiated priend erythroleukemic cells \", Journal of Int"
