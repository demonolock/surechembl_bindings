    "y be used in which case the same steps as outlined above would be used except that the interpretation of results would be the converse of using radioactively or fluorescently labelled serotonin.</p>As would be understood by the skilled artisan these assays may also be performed such that the practitioner measures the radioactivity or fluorescence remaining with the protein, not in the eluent. A preferred such assay employs radiolabeled serotonin. After the competition reaction has been performed the reaction mixture is then passed through a filter, the filter retaining the receptor and whatever is complexed with the receptor. The radioactivity on each filter is then measured in a scintillation counter. In such an assay higher amounts of radiolabel present indicate lower affinity for the receptor by the test compound.</p>The 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor may be free in solution or bound to a solid support. Whether the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor is bound to a support or is free in solution, it is generally important that the conformation of the protein be conserved. In a preferred practice of the invention, therefore, the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor is suspended in a hydrophobic environment employing natural or synthetic detergents, membrane suspensions, and the like. Preferred detergent complexes include the zwitterionic detergent 3- (3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio!-1-propane sulfonate (\"CHAPS\") as well as sodium deoxycholate.</p>Skilled artisans will recognize that desirable dissociation constant (K<sub>i</sub>) values are dependent on the selectivity of the compound tested. For example, a compound with a K<sub>i</sub> which is less than 10 nM is generally considered an excellent candidate for drug therapy. However, a compound which has a lower affinity, but is selective for the particular receptor, may be an even better candidate. The present invention, however, provides radiolabeled competition assays, whether results therefrom indicate high affinity or low affinity to 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor, because skilled artisans will recognize that any information regarding binding or selectivity of a particular compound is beneficial in the pharmaceutical development of drugs.</p>In one such competition assay, a battery of known serotonin receptor antagonists, agonists, and partial agonists were evaluated for their relative abilities to inhibit the binding of  <sup>3</sup> H!5-hydroxytryptamine to the human 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor of the present invention.</p>In this assay suspension cells stably expressing the cloned human 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor were harvested by centrifugation at 2200\u00d7g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Membranes for the binding assays were prepared by vortexing the cell pellet in 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4 (0.5\u00d710<sup>9</sup> cells/30 ml). The tissue suspension was then centrifuged at 39,800\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. This procedure was repeated for a total of three washes, with a 10 minute incubation at 37\u00b0 C. between the second and third"
