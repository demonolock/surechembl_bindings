    "igh affinity and iC3b with a lower affinity. The number of C3b binding sites depends on the allotype and varies from one in type C to four in type D, Wong, W.W. J Invest Dermatol 94:64S-7S (1990). Each of these highly homologous interactive sites also binds C4b but with approximately a log lower affinity than for C3b. Repeats 1-3 bind C4b with barely detectable C3b binding capability. The affinity for dimeric and polymeric C3b increases with the number of binding sites, Wong, W.W., et al. J Immunol 146:556-62 (1990). Each active site requires three contiguous CCPs and critical peptides and amino acids for ligand binding and regulatory activity have been identified, Kalli, K.R., et al. J Immunol 147:590-4 (1991), Krych, M., et al. J Biol Chem 269:13273-8 \n\n(1994), Krych, M., et al. J Biol Chem 273:8623-9 (1998), Krych, M., et al. Mol Immunol 35:403 (1998), and Krych, M., et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88:4353-7 (1991). Kalli et al. J. Exp. Med. 174, 1451-1460 (1991) reported that CR1/CR2 chimeric receptors in which various short consensus repeats (SCRs) of CRl were attached to CR2 were transiently expressed on COS cells. Of COS cells expressing chimeras containing SCR 1-4, 1-3, 2-4, 1-2, and 2-3 of the long homologous repeats (LHRs) -B or -C, 96%, 66%, 23%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, bound pC3b. K562 cells were stably fransfected with wild-type CRl, deletion mutants of CRl, and the CR1/CR2 chimeras, respectively, and assayed for binding of 125I-pC3b. The dissociation constants (Kd) for pC3b of wild-type CRl and the LHR-BD and -CD constructs were in the range of 1.0-2.7 nM, and of the CR1/CR2 chimeras containing SCRs 1-4, 1-3, and 2-4 of LHR-B or -C were 1.8-2.4, 6-9, and 22- 36 nM, respectively. The factor I-cofactor function of the CR1/CR2 chimeras paralleled the C3b-binding function of the constructs. A CRl/immunoglobulin (Ig) chimeric protein prepared by fusing SCRs 1-4 of LHR-B to the heavy chains of a murine F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody was as effective as soluble, full-length CRl in binding pC3b, serving as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b, and inhibiting activation of the alternative pathway, indicating that the bivalent expression of these SCRs reconstitutes the alternative pathway inhibitory function of CRl. These studies showed that the function of SITE 2 was abolished if CCP 10 was replaced by CCP 3 of CR2.</p>PCT US94/10820 by Washington University entitled \"Modified Truncated Complement System Regulators\" describes a number of site specific mutations of CRl that alter activities. However, the effects of the different mutations have been determined to be unique and it is therefore still desirable to provide additional modified forms and information regarding changes that can be made to CRl to alter its biochemical and biological properties.</p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide modified complement regulators. \n\n It is a further object of the present invention to provide modified complement regula",
    "et al., J. Exp. Med. 157, 2160-2165 (1983)), were coupled at 1 mg/ml to cyanogen-bromide activated Sepharose\u2122 (Sepharose\u2122 6B, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway, NJ). iC3, C3 with a disrupted thioester bond, has the same reactivity with CRl as does C3b. To 200 \u03bcl of iC3- or C4b-Sepharose\u2122 (iC3- S or C4b-S), medium (1 ml) from transfected cells containing a CRl derivative was added after adjusting the salt and protein concentration. Following a 30 min incubation at room temperature with occasional mixing, the columns were \n\nwashed with 850 \u03bcl of appropriately diluted PBS containing 1% Nonidet\u2122 P- 40 and the proteins bound to iC3-Sepharose\u2122 or C4b-Sepharose\u2122 were eluted with 1 ml of 300 mM NaCl containing 1% Nonidet\u2122 P-40. The levels of CRl derivatives in the eluates were determined by sandwich ELISA using mAb 3D9 (O'Shea, et al., J Immunol. 134, 2580-2587 (1985)) coated wells and mAb El 1 (a gift from Ronald Taylor, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA) (Hogg, et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 143, 236-243 (1984)), conjugated to horse radish peroxidase. For quantification of the mutants not recognized by 3D9, a rabbit polyclonal Ab to human CRl (Makrides, et al., J Biol. Chem. 267, 24754-24761 (1992)) was used. Results are expressed as percent of CRl derivative bound to iC3-S or C4b-S of that initially offered to the Sepharose\u2122.</p>Effect of mAb 8C9.1 (a gift from Henry Marsh, T Cell Sciences, Inc., Needham, MA) on ligand binding was analyzed in the binding assay described above. The medium containing the CRl derivative and the mAb (l\u03bcg/ml) was added to the Sepharose\u2122 affinity columns.</p>Mapping 8C9.1 and 3D9 epitopes. The 8C9.1 epitope was mapped by ELISA in which wells were coated with 3D9. Bound LHR A derivatives were then detected with biotinylated 8C9.1 followed by horse radish peroxidase conjugated to extravidin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The reduced binding (to mutants 14e and 15a) was assessed by comparing the results of this assay with the standard ELISA which uses El 1 as a detection Ab.</p>The 3D9 epitope was mapped by standard ELISA in which wells were coated with 3D9 and El 1 was used to detect bound proteins. The reduced binding (to mutants 20d and 22a) was measured by comparing these results with those in which wells were coated with polyclonal Ab and El 1 served as a detection Ab.</p>Cofactor assays. C3b and C4b (Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego,CA) were biotinylated by incubating 125 \u03bcg of C3b or C4b with 3.4 \u03bcg of NHS-LC biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature followed by removal of unincorporated biotin on Microcon\u2122 30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Biotinylated C3b or C4b (250 ng) were mixed with \n\n50 ng of factor I (Advanced Research Technologies) and with medium from transfected cells containing 0.002 pmoles of a CRl derivative in 25 mMNaCl. The cofactor protein was limiting reagent in this assay system. A negative control containing all components ex",

To test the effect of these differences on binding, LHR B and C were compared. LHR C binds iC3 and C4b 10-40% more efficiently at 12.5 - 100 mM \u039daCl. These observations provide additional support for a role of sequence 21 in ligand binding.</p>The present invention will be further understood by reference to the following tables NI-NIII. \n\n</p>Table I</p>Amino acids responsible for increase in ligand binding by mutants 14 and 15</p>Construct Binding<sup>3</sup> iC3 C4b</p>%</p>LHR A 17 31</p>LHR B 80 53</p>Mutants in CCP 1</p>14 86 73 a (R12K) 31 39 b (P13L 25 38 c (T14K) 47 54 d (N15T) 39 46 e (L16Q) 20 37 g (D18N) 36 46 h (E19A) 36 49 i (F20S) 35 41 j (E21D) 30 42</p>15 66 65 a (Y27S) 9 27 b (N29K) 63 62 <sup>a</sup> iC3 binding was performed at 12.5, 25, and 100 mMNaCl.
