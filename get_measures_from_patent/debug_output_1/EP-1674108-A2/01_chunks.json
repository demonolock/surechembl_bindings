    "in these preferred compounds, substantially or completely abolish IL-11R interactions with gp130, while having little or no effect on IL-11 binding. However, mutations in other regions of the IL-11 R protein can alter the characteristics of the gp130 binding site on IL-11R and prevent or inhibit productive IL-11R / gp130 interaction. Any and all soluble IL-11 receptor mutants which interfere with the formation of the IL-11 / gp130 / IL-11 tertiary complex, are within the scope of the present invention. Although the specific examples relate to the use of human-derived IL-11R sequences, the corresponding sequences from other mammals will also work.</p>\n  The soluble IL-11 Rs of the present invention are preferably mutated at one or more of positions 282, 283, 286, 289 and 291, as depicted in SEQ ID NO. 4, all of which are within the gp130 binding site of native IL-11R. Specific preferred mutations are D282 to G, A283 to D, G286 to D, H289 to Y, and V291 to L, independently or in combination of two or more such mutations. Amino acids are described herein with reference to their standard three letter and one letter codes. In particular, the symbols D, G, A, H, Y, V and L have the usual meanings in connection with individual amino acids, namely D represents aspartic acid, G represents glycine, A represents alanine, H represents histidine, Y represents tyrosine, V represents valine and L represents leucine.</p>\n  Native IL-11R is a known protein having a molecular mass of about 46 kd. Its amino acid sequence has been determined. It comprises several distinct functional regions, as generally illustrated in Figure 1A of the accompanying drawings. It is normally bound to the cell surface membrane. It has a region for binding to IL-11. Another of its regions, from about position 270-300, is its gp130 binding site. These regions are indicated on Figure 1A wherein 1 represents the amino-terminal region containing 4 positional conserved cysteine residues, 2 represents an IL-11 binding region, 3 represents a gp130 binding region, and 4 represents the transmembrane domain.</p>\n  The amino acid sequence of the gp130 binding site is shown in Figure 2. The present invention, in one of its preferred embodiments, provides IL-11Rs which are mutated in the gp130 binding site illustrated in Figure 2, by replacement of one or more of the native amino acids in this region with other amino acids. Specific preferred products of the present invention are those which have mutations at one or more of positions 282, 283, 286, 289 and 290 as illustrated and as described above. These mutations effectively reduce or even eliminate binding to gp130, but do not materially affect binding to IL-11.</p>\n  The mutant soluble IL-11Rs (sIL-11Rs) of the present invention can be prepared by known techniques. In a preferred process, cDNA encoding the IL-11 R is cloned by RT-PCR using IL-11R specific primers and total RNA isolated from human osteosarcoma cells. The primers contain terminal r",
    " ID. NO. 10. Alternatively, these peptides may have a substantially different amino acid sequence from these sequences, but may have functional attributes permitting specific interactions between these peptides and IL-11. Peptides which are IL-11 binding peptides may be readily identified using one or both of the TRAP assay and the bone nodule formation assay, discussed herein.</p>\n  Protein and peptide sequences which selectively interact with IL-11 are valuable in vitro as well as in vivo. The present invention teaches a peptide sequence which selectively binds IL-11. It is therefore well within the capacity of a technician of ordinary skill to attach this peptide to a suitable substrate by way of an appropriate linking moiety. Once attached, the immobilized peptide sequence may be used to remove IL-11 from solutions. In particular, immobilized peptides can be used to deplete solutions of IL-11. Alternatively, immobilized peptide can be used to bind IL-11 in one solution, and then release IL-11 in the presence of a second solution, thereby allowing the production of a solution enriched in IL-11 or with a reduced number or quantity of components other than IL-11.</p>\n  Thus, another preferred embodiment of the present invention is a process of selectively removing IL-11 from solutions using immobilized peptides of the invention having an affinity for IL-11.</p>\n  In this application, the term \"small molecule\" refers to a compound having a molecular weight of no more than 30 kd, and the term \"IL-11 antagonist\" refers to compounds which inhibit or prevent the productive interaction between IL-11 and IL-11R and which are less effective than IL-11 at promoting the productive interaction of IL-11R and gp130.</p>\n  Particular IL-11 antagonists useful in the treatment of IL-11 related bone density disorders may be identified using the TRAP assay and the bone nodule formation assay, discussed herein. The TRAP assay is known in the art and involves co-culturing murine calvaria (osteoblasts) and bone marrow cells in vitro and then quantifying osteoclast formation by counting the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP+) multinucleated cells. In light of the disclosure herein, and particularly the information pertaining to IL-11 binding peptides, including their sequences and the pattern of conserved residues, it is within the capacity of a competent technician to design potential IL-11 antagonists which are not peptides but which have comparable binding specificities. These potential IL-11 antagonists may be screened to determine if they are IL-11 antagonists by examining their activity in the TRAP assay and the bone nodule formation assay.</p>\n  Other preferred embodiments of the present invention are the use of the TRAP assay and the bone nodule formation assay, individually or in combination, to screen samples for the presence of IL-11 antagonists, and to identify IL-11 antagonists.</p>\n  A third group of preferred compounds are pe"
