    "n of the immunoglobulin of murine origin comprise amino acids 6 to 20, amino acids 44 to 52, amino acids 67 to 76 and amino acids 92 to 101.</p>The above identified amino acid regions of the respective immunoglobulins comprise loop regions to be modified.</p>The immunoglobulin according to the invention is preferably of camel origin.</p>Camel antibodies comprise only one heavy chain and have the same antigen affinity as normal antibodies consisting of light and heavy chains. Consequently camel antibodies are much smaller than, e.g., human antibodies, which allows them to penetrate dense tissues to reach the antigen, where larger proteins cannot. Moreover, the comparative simplicity, high affinity and specificity and the potential to reach and interact with active sites, camel's heavy chain antibodies present advantages over common antibodies in the design, production and application of clinically valuable compounds.</p>The immunoglobulin of camel origin comprises preferably at least one constant domain selected from the group consisting of CH1, CH2 and CH3.</p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the loop regions of CH1, CH2 and CH3 of the camel immunoglobulin comprise amino acids 8 to 20, amino acids 24 to 39, amino acids 42 to 78, amino acids 82 to 85, amino acids 91 to 103 and amino acids 108 to 117.</p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the specific binding of the modified immunoglobulin to the molecule is determined by a binding assay selected from the group consisting of immunological assays, preferably enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance assays, saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transfer NOE (trNOE) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, competitive assays, tissue binding assays, live cell binding assays and cellular extract assays.</p>Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen\u2122 (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE\u00ae), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label.</p>The modified immunoglobulin is preferably conjugated to a label selected from the group consisting of organic molecules, enzyme labels, radioactive labels, colored labels, fluorescent labels, chromogenic labels, luminescent labels, haptens, digoxigenin, biotin, metal complexes, metals, colloidal gold and mixtures thereof.</p>The modified immunoglobulin may be conjugated to other molecules which allow the simple detection of said conjugate in, for instance, binding as"
