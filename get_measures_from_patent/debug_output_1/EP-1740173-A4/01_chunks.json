    "tion was diluted with 50% ethyl acetate-hexanes and washed with 0.5N NaOH (3 x 10 mL), brine (1 x 10 mL), dried (Na<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>), filtered, and concentrated to afford 150 mg of benzofuran methyl ester 11. \n</p>\n  A mixtare of ester 11 (150 mg) LiOH<sup>\u00ab</sup>H<sub>2</sub>0 (95 mg) THF (5 mL) and water (2.5 mL) was stirred vigorously for 2 days. The reaction was quenched with sat. aq. NH CI (10 mL) and the THF removed under reduced pressure. The aq phase was extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>C1<sub>2</sub> (1 x 50 mL), dried (Na<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>), filtered, and concentrated to afford 140 mg of benzofuran 12.</p>\n  Example 25 LAP inhibition assays</p>\n  In the following experiments was used a chimeric BLR domain referred to as MLXBLR3SG in which 11 of 110 residues correspond to those found in XLAP-BLR3, while the remainder correspond to ML-LAP-BLR. The chimeric protein MLXBLR3SG was shown to bind and inhibit caspase-9 significantly better than either of the native BLR domains, but bound Smac-based peptides and mature Smac with affinities similar to those of native ML-LAP-BLR. The improved caspase-9 inhibition of the chimeric BLR domain MLXBLR3SG has been correlated with increased inhibition of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis when transfected into MCF7 cells.</p>\n  MLXBLR3SG sequence:</p>\n  MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLETEEEEEEGAGATLSRGPAFPGMGSEELRLASFYDWP LTAEVPPELLAAAGFFHTGHQDKVRCFFCYGGLQSWKRGDDPWTEHAKWFPGCQFLLR SKGQEYLNNLHLTHSL (SEQ LD NO.: 1)</p>\n  TR-FRET Peptide Binding Assay</p>\n  Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer competition experiments were performed on the Wallac Victor2 Multilabeled Counter Reader (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc.) according to the procedures of Kolb et al (Journal of Biomolecular Screening, 1996, 1(4):203). A reagent cocktail containing 300 nM his-tagged MLXBLR3SG; 200 nM biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVPL); 5 \u03bcg/mL anti-his allophycocyanin (XL665) (CISBio International); and 200 ng/mL streptavidin-europium (Perkin Elmer) was prepared in reagent buffer (50 mM Tris [pH \n\n 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine globulins, 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside). (Alternatively, this cocktail can be made using europium-labeled anti-His (Perkin Elmer) and streptavidin- allophycocyanin (Perkin Elmer) at concentrations of 6.5 nM and 25nM, respectively). The reagent cocktail was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cocktail was added to 1:3 serial dilutions of an antagonist compound (starting concentration of 50 \u03bcM) in 384- well black FLA plates (Greiner Bio-One, Inc.). After a 90 minute incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence was read with filters for the excitation of europium (340 nm) and for the emission wavelengths of europium (615 nm) and a allophycocyanin (665 nm). Antagonist data were calculated as a ratio of the emission signal of allophycocyanin at 665 nm to that of the emission of europium at 615 nm (these ratios were multiplied by a factor of 10,000 for ease of data manipulation). The resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Indications of antagonist potency were determined from the IC50 values. Compounds of formula I' tested in this assay exhibited IC50 values of less than 200\u03bcM indicating LAP inhibitory activity.</p>\n  \nFluorescence Polarization Peptide Binding Assay</p>\n  Polarization experiments were performed on an Analyst HT 96-384 (Molecular Devices Corp.) according to the procedure of Keating, S.M., Marsters, J, Beresini, M., Ladner, C, Zioncheck, K., Clark, K., Arellano, F., and Bodary., S.(2000) in Proceedings of SPIE : In Vitro Diagnostic Instrumentation (Cohn, G.E., Ed.) pp 128-137, Bellingham, WA. Samples for fluorescence polarization affinity measurements were prepared by addition of 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a final concentration of 5\u03bcM of MLXBLR3SG in polarization buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 1% bovine globulins 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside) to 5-carboxyflourescein- conjugated AVPdi-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> (AVP-diPhe-FAM) at 5 nM final concentration.</p>\n  \n AVP-diPhe-FAM probe? The reactions were read after an incubation time of 10 minutes at room temperatare with standard cut-off filters for the fluorescein fluorophore (\u03bb<sub>eX</sub> = 485 nm; \u03bb<sub>em</sub> = 530 nm) in 96-well black HE96 plates (Molecular Devices Corp.). Fluorescence values were plotted as a function of the protein concentration, and the IC50s were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy software, Reading, PA). Competition experiments were performed by addition of the MLXBLR3SG at 30 nM to wells containing 5 nM of the AVP-diPhe- FAM probe as well as 1:3 serial dilutions of antagonist compounds starting at a concentration of 300 \u03bcM in the polarization buffer.
