A fixed concentration of 1 .25 nM biotinylated PD-L1 , approximately equivalent to the IC<sub>50</sub> of \n\n the PD-1 /PD-L1 interaction, was then incubated with the PD-1/antibody complex and PD-L1 binding was detected by fluorescence with phycoerythrin labeled streptavidin.

PBMCs isolated from a chronically infected HIV subject were stimulated with an HIV specific peptide in the presence and absence of an anti- PD-1 antibody.

The binding affinity data presented in Table 2 was evaluated by flow cytometry staining of endogenous cell surface PD-1 on CD4 T cells that were stimulated for a period of 3 to 6 days with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Binding class may also be determined by any technique available to those of ordinary",
    "cells from functional exhaustion but are not necessarily antagonistic, meaning those binding agents that do not necessarily interfere with the interaction between PD-1 and its biological ligand(s) (e.g., PD-L1 or PD-L2 ). An embodiment of the EFRA was to identify such binding agents (antibodies) that bind PD-1 . Epitope mapping of antibody binding to PD-1 was performed with two seperate biochemical assays. In one assay, competitive binding to PD-1 Fc fusion \n\n protein labeled beads was evaluated between one of two commercial anti-PD-1 antibodies (BMS-5C4 and MK3475) and the anti-PD-1 antibodies listed (also described in Table 2). Four classes of monoclonal antibodies binding to distinct epitopes were identified based on this assay. These are: class 1 (competitive with the EH 12.2H7 commercial monoclonal antibody clone that blocks the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1), class 2 (competitive with the J 1 16 commercial monoclonal antibody clone that binds PD-1 but does not effectively block the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1), class 3 (competitive with both the EH12.2H7 and J1 16 commercial monoclonal antibodies), and class 4 (non-competitive with either the EH12.2H7 or J1 16 commercial antibodies). The relative binding of these antibodies for cell surface PD- 1 is represented by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) relative to a control anti-PD-1 antibody in Figure 4. These results show that tight binding antibodies were identified from all four binding classes. A second Luminex binding assay was used to directly evaluate if an anti-PD-1 antibody blocks the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 . This assay was carried out using PD-1 Fc fusion protein coated beads that were incubated in the absence or presence of different concentrations of the anti-PD-1 antibodies listed in Table 2. A fixed concentration of biotinylated PD-L1 , approximately equivalent to the IC<sub>50</sub> of the PD-1 /PD-L1 interaction, was then incubated with the PD-1 /antibody complex and PD-L1 binding was detected using fluorescently labeled streptavidin (representative binding curves shown in Figure 5a-c). Using this biochemical assay, antibodies were defined as being competitive, partially competitive or non-competitive with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The competitive, partially competitive and non-competitive antibodies were identified which bind distinct sites on PD-1 and exhibit high binding affinity (Table 2). Further evaluation of antibodies that bind PD-1 and are non-competitive or partially competitive with PD-L1 were performed by incubating PD-1 Fc fusion protein coated Luminex beads with 20 nM of an anti-PD-1 antibody from Table 2 followed by an incubation of the PD-1/antibody complex with different concentrations of biotinylated PD-L1 . Figure 5d-f shows that a competive anti-PD-1 antibody competely blocks the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. Partially competitive and non-competitive anti-PD-1 antibodies listed in Table 2 results in a shift in the binding affinity "
