    "ll defined and include amino acids with acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan), aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine), aliphatic side chains (e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine), amide (e.g., asparagine, glutamine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and sulfur-containing side chains (cysteine, methionine). Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with alanine, as has been previously described for alanine scanning mutagenesis (MacLennan et al., (1988) Acta Physiol Scand Suppl 643:55-67; Sasaki et al., (1988) Adv Biophys 35:1-24). Amino acid substitutions to the antibodies of the invention may be made by known methods for example by PCR mutagenesis (US Patent No. 4,683,195</patcit>). Alternatively, libraries of variants may be generated for example using random (NNK) or non-random codons, for example DVK codons, which encode 11 amino acids (Ala, Cys, Asp, Glu, Gly, Lys, Asn, Arg, Ser, Tyr, Trp). The resulting antibody variants may be tested for their characteristics using assays described herein.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody may bind CD38 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than about 1\u00d710<sup>7</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>8</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-10</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-11</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-12</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-13</sup> M, 1\u00d710<sup>-14</sup> M or 1\u00d710<sup>-15</sup> , as determined by surface plasmon resonance or the Kinexa method, as practiced by those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the antibody binds human CD38 with a K<sub>D</sub> of less than about 1\u00d710<sup>-8</sup> M. In some embodiments, the antibody binds human CD38 with a K<sub>D</sub> of less than about 1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> M.</p>KinExA instrumentation, ELISA or competitive binding assays known to those skilled in the art. The measured affinity of a particular antibody/ CD38 interaction may vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., osmolarity, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other binding parameters (e.g., K<sub>D</sub>, K<sub>on</sub>, K<sub>off</sub>) are typically made with standardized conditions and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein. Skilled in the art will appreciate that the internal error for affinity measurements for example using Biacore 3000 or ProteOn (measured as standard deviation, SD) may typically be within 5-33% for measurements within the typical limits of detection. Therefore the term \"about\" in the context of K<sub>D</sub> reflects the typical standard deviation in the assay. For example, the typical SD for a K<sub>D</sub> of 1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> M is up to \u00b10.33\u00d710<su"
