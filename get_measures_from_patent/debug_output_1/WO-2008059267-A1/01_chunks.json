    "erence 12) that compound II is 100,000 fold \n\nselective for the O-GlcNAcase active site in comparison to the HexA/HexB enzymes.</p>\n  Enzymology</p>\n  Steady state kinetics of bOGA were determined using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl- N-acetyl-\u03b2-D- glucosaminide (4MU-NAG; Sigma). Standard reaction mixtures (50 \u03bcl) contained 2 pM bOGA in 50 itiM citric acid, 125 rtiM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1.5 - 25 \u03bcM of substrate in water. The reaction mixture was incubated for 466 min at 20 <sup>0</sup>C (RT) . The reaction was stopped by the addition of a 2- fold excess (100 \u03bcl) of 3 M glycine-NaOH, pH 10.3. The fluorescence of the released 4-methylumbelliferone was quantified using using a FLX 800 Microplate Fluorescence Reader (Bio-Tek) , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The production of 4- methylumbelliferone was linear with time for the incubation period used, and less than 10% of the available substrate was hydrolysed. Experiments were performed in triplicate; all of the spectra were corrected for the background emission from the buffer and the protein. Michaelis-Menten parameters were obtained by fitting the fluorescence intensity with GraFit [ref 19] .</p>\n  Determination of compound II K<sub>\u00b1</sub> was performed by steady- state kinetics in the presence of different concentrations (0, 35, 70, 140 pM) of the inhibitor. The mode of inhibition was visually verified by the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Figure 2), and the Ki determined by fitting all fluorescence intensity data to the standard equation for competitive inhibition in GraFit [Ref 19] . Using this approach, the following parameters were determined from the data shown: Ki = 4.6 \u00b1 0.2 pM, K<sub>m</sub> = 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM, k<sub>cat</sub> = 8.1 \u00b1 0.5 s<sup>\"1</sup>. \n\nSteady state kinetics of hexosaminidases A and B (purchased from Sigma, catalogue number A6152), were determined using the fluorogenic substrate 4MU-GIcNAc substrate described above, using the same standard reaction mixture, with the following changes: 5*10<sup>6</sup> units / ml enzyme mixture was used with a varying substrate concentration between 200 and 1000 \u03bcM. Determination of the compound II Ki for placental hexosaminidases was performed by steady-state kinetics in the presence of different concentrations (0, 200, 400 nM) of the inhibitor, and interpreted as for bOGA, with the data shown in Figure 3. The following parameters were determined from the data shown: K<sub>\u00b1</sub> - 0.52 + 0.07 \u03bcM, K<sub>m</sub> = 400 \u00b1 40 \u03bcM.</p>\n  To evaluate the usefulness of compound II as a chemical tool to study the effects of inhibition of OGA in human- cells, activity of the compound in human SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lysates and the HEK 293 cell line was evaluated. Fig. 4A shows that compound II is more active than PUGNAc in inhibiting bOGA from removing O-GlcNAc <sup>\u2022</sup> from proteins in SH-SY5Y cell lysates. More importantly, when used to treat HEK 293 cells, compound II was more efficient at raising O-GlcNAc levels than PUGNAc (Fig. 4B) .</p>\n  Example 3</p>\n  The Ki against both a bacterial O-GlcNAcase (bOGA) (NagJ from Clostridium perfringens; Reference 12) and against a mixture of the human placental hexosaminidases HexA/HexB was obtained for each of Compounds III, IV and V in the same manner as described above in example 2 for compound II. The results are shown in the Table below together with those for compound II. \n\n Table 1</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000038_0001\" path=\"imgf000038_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85755614/WO/20080522/A1/002008/05/92/67/imgf000038_0001.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n  These results illustrate the selectivity of compounds general formula I for the O-GlcNAcase active site in comparison to the HexA/HexB enzymes. Compound II exhibits a particularly high selectivity with the ratio between the Ki values found in excess of 100,000. Example 4</p>\n  A comparison of the inhibition of human OGA (hOGA) by- Compound II and PUGNAc is shown in Figure 5. The methodology used was similar to that described above for bOGA. The graph illustrates the effect of increasing concentration of each of the inhibitors on the enzyme activity of OGA measured in fluorescence absorbance units and demonstrates that GlcNacstain is a more potent inhibitor than PUGNac. The IC50 results obtained were: PUGNAc: IC50: 71 nM +- 6 nM</p>\n  GlcNAcstatin C: 8 nM +- 0.7 nM. \n\nReferences</p>\n  (1) Torres, C. R.; Hart, G. W.
