To these belong 9 and 10, whose activity, in an assay concerning the inhibition of C5a induced calcium mobilization, was described to be 24 and 465 nM, respectively. However, further analysis of the compounds in a functional assay of C5a induced enzyme release by stablye transfected rat-basophil cells expressing the human C5a receptor (Example 28), shows that 9 and 10 have only a minor activity of 7152 nM or &gt;4760 nM. Compound 8 which is claimed in the patent WO03082826, shows only very low activity (1917 nM) in an enzyme release assay.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00007\" path=\"US08071810-20111206-C00007.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/159967241/US/20111206/B2/000008/07/18/10/US08071810-20111206-C00007.TIF\"/></p>The company Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation filed patent applications with two principally different scaffolds, which can be represented by 11 and 12 (W-54011). The compound 11 not only has got a poor activity (Example 28) but also the disadvantage of a poor shelf life (Example 25). For W-54011 a very high biologic activity was described: an IC<sub>50 </sub>value of 3.1, 2.7 and 1.6 nM for the rhC5a-induced calcium mobilization, chemotaxis and ROS release was respectively measured (Sumichika et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277: 49403). Sumichika described the compound as being more active in a binding assay than the peptide mimetic PMX53 (a hexamer, cyclic peptide with the formula Ac-F[OPchaWR]) and even more active than an anti C5a receptor monoclonal antibody (Sumichika 2004 Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 5: 505). In an enzyme release assay according to Example 28W-54011 shows an IC50 value of 90 nM which is notedly bigger than the IC<sub>50 </sub>value given in the previously described assay. Despite this still satisfactory activity, the compound has other disadvantages: the solubility in PBS-buffered aqueous solution is only 0.4 \u03bcM and the chemical synthesis requires an enantioselective step or an enantiomer separation, if there is the need to administer only one enantiomer. In the last years no further development or data concerning the compound W-54011 were published.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00008\" path=\"US08071810-20111206-C00008.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/159967927/US/20111206/B2/000008/07/18/10/US08071810-20111206-C00008.TIF\"/></p>Finally, it can be concluded that all small molecule inhibitors known until now, as reported in the prior art, show at least one of these disadvantages: poor specificity, agonistic activity, poor affinity, poor solubility in water, poor shelf life, chemical reactivity, poor metabolic stability or inhibition of P450 enzymes. Clinical studies were carried out solely with one of the small molecule C5a-inhibitors (NGD 2000-1 of the company Neurogen; Shaw and Hutchison, 220th ACS National Meeting, Washington, D.C., August 2000). Therein, the efficacy of the C5a inhibitor was proven for the indication rheumatoid arthritis (ACR improvement), however the properties of the substance (e.g. cytochrome inhibition) were not adequate for a higher dosage in human in a way to reach a clinically relevant therapeu"
