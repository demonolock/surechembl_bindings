    "ta (A\u03b2) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress increase the formation of intracellular inclusions in Neuro2a cells expressing apoE4.</p>\n  Since A\u03b2 deposition is a major pathological component within the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, we determined the effect of A\u03b2 treatment on the formation of apoE and p-tau immunoreactive intracellular inclusions in Neuro2a cells expressing apoE. The results are shown in Figure 1. A\u03b2l-42 treatment clearly increased the number of inclusion-positive apoE4 expressing cells from 2.7\u00b11.2% to 6.7+1.5% (pO.OOl) and apoE3 expressing cells, from 0% to 2.8+0.6% (p&lt;0.001). These results suggest that A\u03b2l-42 potentiates the formation of intracellular inclusions in Neuro2a cells expressing apoE.</p>\n  Since A\u03b2 treatment of cells can cause ER stress (TN98), other ER stress inducers, including Brefeldin A (BfA) and tunicamycin (TN98), were used to determine whether ER stress can increase the formation of intracellular inclusions in apoE fransfected Neuro2a cells. Incubation with either BfA or tunicamycin increased the inclusion-positive cells from 2.7\u00b11.2% to 7.2\u00b12J% (pO.OOl) in apoE4 expressing cells and from 0% to 3.2\u00b11J% (pO.OOl) in apoE3 expressing cells.</p>\n  To test whether apoE directly interacts with p-tau and p-NF-H, coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed on cell lysates of apoE4-transfected Neuro- 2a cells treated with A\u03b2l-42 or BfA. Immunoprecipitation using anti-p-tau revealed the presence of 2-3 bands (molecular weight 50-60 Kd) detected by anti-p-tau antibody on western blots. In addition, p-NF-H (molecular mass ~200 Kd) was also detected within the \n\ncomplex. However, anti-apoE western blotting did not reveal full-length apoE but rather a band with a lower molecular weight (~30 Kd instead of 34 Kd). These results confirm that the intracellular inclusions of the Neuro-2a cells are composed of p-tau and p-NF-H and demonstrate that the apoE4 in the complex is a truncated form with a molecular weight 10- 15% smaller than the full-length apoE.</p>\n  Carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE induces formation of intracellular inclusions in Neuro-2a cells.</p>\n  To determine whether the amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncation of apoE can induce formation of the intracellular inclusions, Neuro-2a cells were transfected with constructs possessing either amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoE. Deletion of up to 28</p>\n  (~10%) amino-terminal amino acids of apoE4 did not result in formation of the intracellular inclusions. However, deletion of 28 (~10%) carboxyl-terminal amino acids from either apoE3 (\u0394272-299) or a\u03c1oE4 (\u0394272-299) resulted in 32\u00b15% or 78\u00b18%, respectively, of the transfected cells displaying the intracellular filamentous inclusions. The intracellular inclusions in the Neuro-2a cells transfected with apoE4(\u0394272-299) were immuno-reactive with anti-apoE, anti-p-tau, and anti-p-NF-H. There was complete merging of the immuno- reactivity of the inclusions, as shown for anti-apoE and anti-p-tau, indicating co-localization of apoE and p-tau). The intracellular inclusions induced by apoE3(\u0394272-299) were similar but were smaller and were visible in many fewer cells. These results suggest that carboxyl- terminal truncated apoE, especially apoE4(\u0394272-299), interacts with cy",
    "rofilament antibodies, RT97 and N14, which recognize the phosphorylated NF-H, and N52, which recognizes nonphosphorylated NF-H.</p>\n  Table II.

Immunofluorescent staining of Neuro-2a cells expressing GFP- apoE4(\u0394272-299) demonstrated that the inclusions were positive for some, but not all, of the monoclonal antibodies that recognize p-tau in paired helical filaments (PHF) in human Alzheimer's disease brains (Table II), suggesting that some, but not all, serine or threonine residues of tau protein were phosphorylated in the infracellular inclusions in Neuro-2a cells. Immunostaining with anti-p-NF-H antibody, RT97, demonstrated that the intracellular inclusion also contained p-NF-H.</p>\n  To confirm the presence of both p-tau and p-NF-H, cell lysates containing the inclusions from apoE4(\u0394272-299) transfected Neuro-2 cells were immunoprecipitated with \n\nanti-apoE antibody. Then, anti-p-tau antibody western blotting revealed proteins with molecular mass of 40-60 Kd, which were p-tau proteins. Likewise, anti-p-NF-H antibody (RT97) western blotting revealed p-NF-H with molecular mass of 200 Kd. Other bands with molecular mass of 40-60 Kd, characteristic of tau isoforms, were also recognized by monoclonal antibody RT97. It has been reported that monoclonal antibody RT97 cross- reacts with phosphorylated tau; therefore, these bands are likely p-tau proteins.</p>\n  On the other hand, if the cellular lysates from apoE4(\u0394272-299) transfected cells were immunoprecipited with monoclonal antibodies against p-tau or p-NF-H, anti-apoE western blotting revealed a band with molecular mass of ~30 KD, i.e., apoE4(\u0394272-299). Taken together, these results suggest that apoE4(\u0394272-299) forms a complex with p-tau and p-NF-H to form the intracellular inclusions in Neuro-2a cells. These intracellular inclusions have similar ultrastructural and biochemical characteristics of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) seen in human Alzheimer's disease brains and, thus, we refer them to NFT-like structures. Amino acids 244-260 ofapoE interact with p-tau and p-NF-H to form the NFT-like structures in Neuro-2a cells.</p>\n  To determine the region of apoE that interacted directly with p-tau and p-NF-H to form the NFT-like structures, an additional series of carboxyl-terminal truncations on the GFP-apoE4(\u0394272-299) DNA constructs (without signal peptide) were prepared and transfected into Neuro-2a cells. Sites of truncation are illustrated in Figure 3 A. The results are shown in Figure 3B. Truncation to amino acid 260 (apoE4(\u0394261-299)) did not alter the ability of the carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 to induce formation of the NFT-like structures, although truncation to amino acid 252 (apoE4(\u0394252-299)( slightly decreased the formation of the intracellular NFT-like structures. However, truncation to amino acid 244 (apoE4(\u0394244-299)) abolished the formation of the NFT-like structures, suggesting that there are critical residues in the region 244-260 that are responsible for binding to p-tau and p-NF- H to form the NFT-like structures in Neuro-2a cells.</p>\n  To confirm this observation, a GFP-apoE(\u0394",
    "ed with the lipid transport vehicle \u03b2-VLDL. After 30 hours incubation, neurite outgrowth and the formation of NFT-like structures in the cells were determined. Neuro-2a cells incubated with lipid transport vehicle alone for 30 hours showed neurite outgrowth. However, cells incubated with exogenous apoE4(\u0394272-299) changed the morphology of the cells and did not show neurite outgrowth, suggesting that internalized apoE4(\u0394272-299) might impair cytoskeletal structure and function. Anti-apoE immunofluorescent staining demonsfrated that the NFT-like structures were formed in \n\nNeuro-2a cells incubated with exogenous apoE4(\u0394272-299). These structures were identical to the tangle-like structures formed inNeuro-2a cells expressing GFP-apoE4(\u0394272-299) in the cytosol. Therefore internalized apoE4(\u0394272-299) can escape the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and interact with cytosolic p-tau and p-NF-H. Carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE can be generated inside neurons.</p>\n  To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoE generated naturally inside neurons, Neuro-2a cells were transfected with full-length apoE3 or apoE4 (with signal peptide), or Neuro-2a cells were incubated with exogenous full-length apoE3 or apoE4. After lysis of the cells, intracellular apoE was immunoprecipitated with a monospecific anti-apoE antibody. Anti-apoE western blotting revealed a full-length apoE band and a lower molecular weight band, the molecular mass of which was similar to apoE(\u0394272-299) (-30 Kd). More fragments were generated from apoE4 than from apoE3. The lower molecular weight band represents a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of apoE, as detected by a monoclonal antibody, 6C5, which recognizes the amino-terminal 15 amino acids. Therefore, the shorter fragment is the carboxyl-terminal truncated form of apoE composed of approximately 270 amino acids. This conclusion was confirmed in transfected Neuro-2a cells expressing apoE4 with an amino-terminal FLAG tag. Anti-FLAG antibody also recognized a protein band with molecular mass of ~30 Kd.</p>\n  Since A\u03b2l-42 increased formation of intracellular inclusions in Neuro2a cells expressing apoE4, we next determined whether freatment of the transfected cells with A\u03b2 will increase generation of the carboxyl-terminal truncated fo\u03c0n of apoE. Neuro-2a cells expressing apoE3 or apoE4 were incubated with A\u03b2l-42, then, intracellular apoE was immunoprecipitated and detected by anti-apoE western blotting. Treatment of the transfected cells with A\u03b2l-42 significantly increased the amounts of the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of both apoE3 and apoE4, but more so with apoE4. Similar results were also obtained when exogenous apoE3 or apoE4 were incubated with Neuro-2a cells in the presence of A\u03b2l-42. These results suggest that A\u03b2l-42 may activate some unknown proteolytic enzymes that cleave apoE, especially apoE4, at its carboxyl-terminus, creating a biologically active truncated form. Carboxyl-terminal truncated forms ofapoE are found in brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients.</p>\n  To determine whether carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoE can be generated in vivo in human brains, we analyzed apoE in brain lysates from normal or Alzheimer's disease \n\npatients by western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against full-length apoE or carboxyl-terminal portion of apoE (amino acids 272-299). The results are shown in Figures 4A-E.</p>\n  Polyclonal anti-apoE revealed full-length apoE in both the supernatant and the pellet of brain lysates from normal and Alzheimer's disease patients. An apoE fragment with molecular mass of -29 Kd was also recognized by polyclonal anti-apoE in supernatant from both normal and Alzheimer's disease brains, but to a greater extent in Alzheimer's disease brains. The 29-Kd apoE fragment was also found in the pellet of Alzheimer's disease brains, but not in the pellet of normal brains. In addition, smaller apoE fragments with molecular mass of ~14- 19 Kd were found in both supernatant and the pellet of Alzheimer' s disease brains but not of normal brains.</p>\n  However, western blotting using antibody against carboxyl-terminal portion of apoE (amino acids 272-299) only revealed full-length apoE but not those apoE fragments in both supernatant and the pellets, suggesting that the fragments are carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoE. Also note that large complexes (molecular mass over 220 Kd) were detected in the pellets of Alzheimer's disease brains by anti-full-length apoE and anti-p-tau but not by anti-carboxyl-terminal apoE, suggesting that these large complexes contain carboxyl- terminal truncated forms of apoE and p-tau. Taken together, these results suggest that carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoE are generated to a much greater extent in Alzheimer's disease brains than in normal brains, and most of them are present in insoluble forms, probably forming complexes with p-tau.</p>\n  Example 2: Analysis of transgenic mice expressing apoE3 or apoE4 specifically in CNS neurons Generation of transgenic mice</p>\n  Transgenic mice expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 specifically in central nervous system (CNS) neurons were generated at the Gladstone Institutes as reported previously (Raber J. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998, 95:10914-10919; Muttini M. et al. J. Neurosci. 1999, 19:4867-4880). The expression of apoE transgenes was driven by a neuron- specific enolase (NSE) promoter. NSE-apoE3 and NSE-apoE4 lines with matched cerebral levels of transgene expression were selected and crossed with apoE<sup>\"\u039b</sup> mice (C57BL/6J- apoEtmlUnc) from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). After elimination of wild-type mouse apoE alleles in two generations of breedings among the resulting offspring, transgenic \n\nmice were further crossed with apoE<sup>\"A</sup> mice to generate NSE-apoE3 and NSE-apoE4 mice that had at least 95% C57BL/6J genetic background.
