    "a Corp., Madison, Wis.), as described below. Clones demonstrating significant induction of CRE-luciferase expression in response to forskolin, as compared to unstimulated (basal) luciferase expression, were retested, and clone KZ10-20-48 with a 20 fold (range 15-25 fold) induction of CRE-luciferase was selected.</p>B. Creation of human calcitonin receptor/CRE-Luciferase Cell Line: Hollex-1Receptor positive cell line</p>KZ10-20-48 was tranfected, using calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (as described above), with pHollex encoding a human calcitonin receptor cDNA (cloned from a cDNA library derived from T47D human mammary tumor cells (ATCC, HBL 133), as described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/100,887) and a neomycin selectable marker. Stable transfectants were selected following 10-12 days growth in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 250 nM MTX and containing 1 mg/ml G418. Clones were isolated, grown to confluence in opaque white Dynatech microtiter tissue culture plates, then treated with 1 \u03bcM human calcitonin or 25 mM forskolin for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and assayed for luciferase induction as described below. Clones demonstrating significant induction of CRE-luciferase in response to human calcitonin were re-screened following treatment with human calcitonin at concentrations ranging from 0.001-1000 nM, and clone Hollex-1 with a 20 fold (range 10-25 fold) induction of luciferase, a human calcitonin EC50 of 0.02 nM, and a forskolin EC50 of 1.2 \u03bcM, was selected for use in the high throughput screening assay for calcitonin mimetics.</p>Receptor negative cell Line</p>KZ10-20-48 was also transfected with plasmid Zem 228 lacking the human calcitonin receptor gene, and the resulting transfectant pool, KZ10-20-48/Zem 228, was isolated for use as a receptor-negative specificity control for substances found to induce luciferase expression in Hollex 1 in the primary screen. Forskolin induces CRE-luciferase in KZ10-20-48/Zem 228 by 30 fold (range 20-35 fold) with an EC50 of 0.6 \u03bcM (range 0.5-1.5 \u03bcM), while human calcitonin at concentrations up to 1000 nM fails to induce CRE-luciferase levels above the basal level of expression</p>Care was taken to select calcitonin receptor-positive and -negative clones that had similar CRE-luciferase inducibility, as demonstrated by forskolin dose responses that were essentially superimposable for the two cell lines. This criteria ensured that even small magnitude differences in response to test substances of calcitonin receptor-positive cells over calcitonin receptor-negative cells would be meaningful.</p>C. Creation of hamster calcitonin receptor/Luciferase Cell Line: Boris/KZ10-3An alternative cell line expressing the hamster calcitonin receptor was isolated for use in calcitonin mimetic screening. BHK 570 cells were transfected with the human cDNA library derived from T47D cells in plasmid vector Zem 228. Stable transfectants were isolated following 10-12 days growth in G418.</p>Colonies were tested for their ability to bind <sup>125</sup> I-human calcitonin. The cells were plated at a density of 1\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 24-well cell culture dish and allowed to grow for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1 mg/ml G418 . The cells were rinsed in binding medium (500 ml RPMI 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 1 mg/ml BSA (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.)) to remove serum. Three hundred microliters of binding medium containing radiolabeled <sup>125</sup> I human calcitonin (binding only or competition also) were added to appropriate wells. The cells were incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature, and then rinsed 3 times with PBS to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Five hundred microliters of 1 N NaOH was added to each well to solubilize the cells. The samples were collected from each well and CPMs were counted on a gamma counter.</p>One clone, Boris, with high calcitonin receptor expression was re-transfected with pKZ10, as described above, and stable transfectants were isolated following 10-14 days growth in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 250 nM MTX and 1 mg/ml G418. Clones were isolated and screened for induction of luciferase expression by human calcitonin or forskolin, as described below. Clone Boris/KZ10-3, with a 30 fold (range 25-40X) induction of luciferase in response to human calcitonin, was selected for use in high throughput screening for calcitonin mimetics. Boris/KZ10-3 had a 25 fold (range 0.7-1.5 \u03bcM) response to forskolin (EC50=0.9 \u03bcM).</p>The human calcitonin receptor negative clone KZ10-20-48/Zem 228, described above, was used as a specificity check for substances found to induce luciferase expression in Boris/KZ10-3 during primary screens.</p>D. Creation of human Glucagon Receptor/CRE-Luciferase Cell Line: KZ10-20-48/pLJ6-4-25</p>Test substances that appeared to specifically increase luciferase induction in calcitonin receptor-positive cells, but not calcitonin receptor-negative cells, were subjected to an additional specificity check, i.e., their inability to activate other members of the G-protein coupled-receptor family. The glucagon receptor is another member of the G-protein coupled receptor family that transduces signal through adenylate cyclase mediated elevation of cAMP (Robison et al., Cyclic AMP, Academic Press, New York, 1971; Jelinek et al., Science 259:1614-16, 1993). KZ10-20-48 was transfected, as above, with pLJ6' (deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 ParkLawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, under Accession Number 69183) as disclosed in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/086,631, containing the human glucagon receptor cDNA in plasmid pHZ-1, which also contains a DHFR selectable marker. Stable transfectants were selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 250 nM MTX and 1 mg/ml G418, and were screened for CRE-luciferase induction in response to 25 mM forskolin or 1000 nM human glucagon (Sigma), as described below. Clone KZ10-20-48/pLJ6-4-25 was selected for use in specificity confirmation. This clone exhibits a 35 fold induction of luciferase in response to human glucagon (EC50=0.2 nM ) or forskolin (EC50=2.1 \u03bcM).</p>Example 3CRE-Luciferase Assay Method for Calcitonin Mimetics</p>Receptor-positive and -negative cell lines were maintained by serial passage in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 250 nM MTX, and 1 mg/ml G418). On the day prior to assay, cells were trypsinized, adjusted to 2\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in growth medium, plated in opaque white Dynatech Microlite microtiter tissue culture plates at 100 \u03bcl/well (2\u00d710<sup>4</sup> cells), and grown overnight to confluence, 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>Test substances were prepared in H<sub>2</sub> O or DMSO at 100 times the final desired assay concentration. Induction was initiated by removing spent medium from the wells and adding 100 \u03bcl/well test substance diluted 1:100 or 1:1000 (first round screening extracts were diluted 1:1000) in assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM Hepes pH 7.25). Controls were included on each plate: untreated wells (basal), 25 mM forskolin, and 100 nM human calcitonin. If test substances were prepared in DMSO, then an equal concentration of DMSO was included in control wells (not to exceed a final assay concentration of 2% DMSO, with a preferred maximum of 1%). Plates were incubated for 3 to 8 hours (4 hours preferred) at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>Luciferase induction was measured using a Promega luciferase assay kit (El500) according to the assay kit protocol. Briefly, ass",
    "luciferase induction of 25.9% was observed on the receptor positive cell line at a 1:100 dilution of extract, while the maximum luciferase induction observed on the receptor negative cell line was 0.3%. Based on these results, the purification of the active compound(s) from this extract was undertaken, guided at all steps by the CRE-luciferase assay on both the receptor positive and negative cell lines.</p>              TABLE 1                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \nEffect of Calcitonin Mimetics on the Induction of                         \nCRE-Luciferase in BHK 570 Cells Expressing Human                          \nCalcitonin Receptor and a CRE-Luciferase Reporter                         \n              CRE-Luciferase Induction                                    \nCalcitonin Mimetic                                                        \n              EC.sub.50 (nM)                                              \n______________________________________                                    \nZG 2807 A     506                                                         \n(SEQ.

At the time of assay, growth medium was removed and replaced with 50 \u03bcl/well of test sample, forskolin, or human calcitonin in assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, and 10 \u03bcM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma)) pre-warmed to 37\u00b0 C. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, followed by addition to each well of 200 \u03bcl water heated to just below the boiling point. After 15 minutes at room temperature, the supernatants were collected and transferred to a new microtiter plate and stored at -20\u00b0 C. until assayed for cAMP. cAMP concentrations were determined using a radioimmunoassay scintillation proximity assay (SPA) kit (RPA 538) (Amersham Corp.) following the acetylation protocol described in the package insert. Alternatively, a conventional cAMP RIA assay may be used (Steiner et al., J. Biol. Chem. 247:1106-13, 1972; Harper and Brooker, J. Cyc. Nucl. Res. 1:207-18, 1975). The basal (uninduced) cAMP level in untreated cells was subtracted from all treated samples. The concentration of cAMP induced by test substances was expressed as a percentage of the cAMP concentration induced by forskolin or human calcitonin.</p>Example 5Bone Resorption</p>A.

    " toxicity (or death) was also evaluated morphologically. A low level of toxicity was indicated by the appearance of pyknotic nuclei in a small number of bone cells. With an increased level of toxicity, a further increase in the number of these pyknotic nuclei, detachment of cells from bone surfaces, and losses of cytoplasmic stain and cell boundaries were observed. The osteocytic space also appeared empty.</p>              TABLE 2                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \nEffect of Calcitonin Mimetics on PTH-Induced                              \nBone Resorption in Mouse Calvariae                                        \n           Inhibition of Ca++ Release                                     \nCalcitonin Mimetic                                                        \n             EC.sub.50 (\u03bcM)                                            \n                         Histology                                        \n______________________________________                                    \nZG 2807 A    33.2        Inhibition of osteoclast                         \n(SEQ.
