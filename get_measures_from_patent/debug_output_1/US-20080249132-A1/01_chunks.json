    "ms and the crystalline forms of the compound of formula (I) may exist as polymorphs, which are included in the present invention.</p>The compound of the invention is a human metabolite of 4-(S)-(4-Acetyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(R)-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid, [1-(R)-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ethyl]-methylamide which is described in WO 02/32867.</p>The compound of the invention is itself an antagonist of tachykinin receptors, including substance P and other neurokinins, both in vitro and in vivo and is thus of use in the treatment of conditions mediated by tachykinins, including substance P and other neurokinins.</p>Tachykinins are a family of peptides that share a common carboxyl-terminal sequence (Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). They are actively involved in the physiology of both lower and advanced lifeforms. In mammalian lifeforms the main tachykinins are substance P (SP), Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB) which act as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Mammalian tachykinins may contribute to the pathophysiology of a number of human diseases.</p>Three types of tachykinins receptors have been identified, namely NK1(SP-preferring), NK2 (NKA-preferring) and NK3 (NKB-preferring) which are widely distributed throughout the central nervous (CNS) and peripheral nervous system.</p>Particularly, the compound of the invention is an antagonist of the NK1 receptor.</p>NK<sub>1</sub>-receptor binding affinity has been determined in vitro in filtration binding assay by measuring the compounds' ability to displace [<sup>3</sup>H]-Substance P (SP) from recombinant human NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors stably expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes prepared by using a modification of the method described by Beattie D. T. et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol, 116:3149-3157, 1995).</p>Briefly, ligand binding was performed in 0.4 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% BSA, 0.5 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-Substance P (30-56 Ci/mmol Amersham), a final membrane protein concentration of 30-50 \u03bcg/ml, and the test compounds. The incubation proceeded at room temperature for 40 min and was stopped by filtration. Non-specific binding was determined using excess of substance P (1 \u03bcM) and represents about 6-10% of the total binding. IC<sub>50 </sub>values of each compound were determined by an 8-point 10\u00d7-dilution inhibition curve. pK<sub>i </sub>values were calculated using the K<sub>D </sub>of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Substance P determined in a separate experiment.</p>The compound of the invention is further characterised in a functional assay for the determination of their effect to inhibit the intracellular calcium increase induced by SP in Human-NK<sub>1</sub>-CHO cells using FLIPR technology. Briefly, after 30 minutes incubation with the cytoplasmic calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM (2 \u03bcM), cells were washed and incubated in the absence or presence of three or more different concentrations of the antagonist for 60 minutes, at 37\u00b0 C.",
