Briefly, human PD-Ll-Fc (R&amp;D Systems) chimeric protein was coated in 96 well plates at 0.5 mg/ml in carbonate buffer. After saturation with 5% casein/PBS, plates were washed and a dilution of AFFIMER\u00ae polypeptides or controls were incubated for 90 minutes. Plates were then washed and a biotinylated polyclonal antibody anti-cystatin A (R&amp;D Systems) was added for 1 hour. Plates were washed and AFFIMER\u00ae polypeptides were detected using Strepativin-HRP. After a last washing step, TMB was added for the development of the experiment and plates were read at 450 nm. The two (2) constructs tested exhibit similar EC50 (ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 nM) and are identical to the anti-PD-Ll parental ILF dimer molecule (PD-L1 -251 BH (SEQ ID NO: 1270). </p>Similarly, the binding to hu FcRn has been assessed at pH 6 (as described in example 2). The two (2) constructs tested exhibit similar EC50 (ranging from 0.03 to 0.49 nM) and decrease binding to target protein less than 20-fold compared to the parental molecule (FcRn-38; SEQ ID NO: 708) (FIG. 2). </p>Example 5.

When required, additional peptide sequences can be added between the AFFIMER\u00ae polypeptide and the HIS tag such as MYC (EQKLISEEDL) (SEQ ID NO: 1297) for detection or a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQ(G/S)) (SEQ ID NO: 1298) to allow for the removal of tags. AFFIMER\u00ae proteins were expressed from E. coli and purified using IMAC, a second stage purification to remove endotoxin, CHT (Ceramic hydroxyapatite, BioRad) type I resin or cation ion exchange (HiTrap, Cytiva) with a triton 114x wash step (Sigma), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Cytiva). AFFIMER\u00ae monomer purification from E. coli was performed by transforming the expression plasmid pD861 (Atum) into BL21 E. coli cells (Millipore) using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.</p>The total transformed cell mixture was plated onto LB agar plates containing 50pg/ml kanamycin (AppliChem) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The following day, the lawn of transformed E. coli was transferred to a sterile flask of lx terrific broth media (Melford) and 50 pg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 30\u00b0C shaking at 2",
