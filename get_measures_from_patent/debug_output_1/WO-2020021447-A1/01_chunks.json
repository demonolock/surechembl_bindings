    "p; Sons). These groups are removed at a convenient stage of the compound synthesis using methods that are readily apparent to those skilled in the art. </p> Unless otherwise noted, reagents and solvents were used as received from commercial suppliers. </p> The chemical names were generated using ChemBioDraw Ultra v14 from CambridgeSoft.</p>Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. If not mentioned otherwise, all evaporations are performed under reduced pressure, typically between about 15 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg (= 20 \n\n - 133 mbar). The structure of final products, intermediates and starting materials is confirmed by standard analytical methods, e.g., microanalysis and spectroscopic characteristics, e.g., MS, IR, NMR.
