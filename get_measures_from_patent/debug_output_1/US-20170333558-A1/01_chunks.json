The affinity optimized variants are similarly constructed on the human IgG4/lambda isotype frameworks.</p>TABLE 2Biochemical properties of candidateanti-Pro/latent-Myostatin antibodiesTheoretical MW(Da)CalculatedAntibodyAffinity (Octet) pM*aglycosylatedpIAb14760144809.86.9Ab23420144735.66.7Ab4472144661.76.7Ab6331144629.56.7</p>Platform and Identification of Parental AntibodyThe parental Ab1 antibody was identified via selection of a na\u00efve phage display library using pro- and latent- myostatin as the primary antigens for selection. Phage selection and initial screening were performed using a library displaying conventional scFv in a format similar to that described by McCafferty et al. (McCafferty et. al., 1990). Each round of selection consisted of pre-clearing (for removal of nonspecific phage antibodies), incubation with antigen, washing, elution and amplification. Selections were performed via multiple rounds using both solid phase (biotinylated antigens coated on immunotubes) and solution phase (biotinylated antigens, captured using streptavidin coated beads) panning strategies.</p>In total, 10,000 individual scFv clones were screened for binding to pro- or latent-myostatin through two",
    "rted to full length IgG (IgG1 isotype) for additional characterization.</p>Full-length IgG antibodies were further characterized by ELISA for binding to the human and murine pro- and latent- forms of myostatin and GDF11. Antibodies were also screened for binding to the Myostatin prodomain, pro TGF\u03b2 (human and murine), the mature growth factor of Myostatin, the GDF11 mature growth factor, the Activin A growth factor, and proActivin A. Lead antibodies were selected based on their cross-reactivity with pro- and latent human and murine Myostatin, with no interactions with GDF11, Activin, or TGF\u03b2 proteins.</p>Two forms of epitope binning were employed. First, chimeric constructs which swapped portions of the prodomains of Myostatin and GDF11 were designed and produced. These chimeric proteins were assayed for interaction with screening antibodies by ELISA. Epitope binning was carried out using a ForteBio BLI instrument, in which the biotinylated pro/latent-Myostatin antibody was immobilized on a streptavidin coated biosensor chip, and cross-blocking of antibodies was evaluated by sensor response. These epitope binning experiments, along with data from the ELISA binding experiments, allowed for the segregation of our functionally active lead antibodies (see below) into three distinct epitope groups (see Table 3).</p>TABLE 3Ranking of five anti-pro/latent-Myostatin IgG1 antibodies% body weight% lean massHumanMurineincreaseincreaseproGDF8proGDF8proGDF8in 6 weeksin 4 weeksCloneKd (\u03bcM)IC50<sup>2 </sup>(\u03bcM)IC50<sup>2 </sup>(\u03bcM)25 mg/kg/20 mg/kg/EpitopeID(octet)Reporter assayReporter assayweekweekbinAb111.50.9961.4614.58*14.1*1Ab7280.9831.6812.42*ND1Ab80.56.037139<sup>1</sup>\u2003\u200310.33*7.42Ab92212.1619.86\u20027.44ND3Ab100.30.772NDND14.3*1*Statistical significance by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett.Ab8 does not bind latent myostatin, only pro/Myostatin. Murine pro/latent-Myostatin preparations have ~40% latent material which reduces the apparent efficacy in functional assays.ND: Not determined.</p>In order to evaluate the ability of antibodies to bind and inhibit the activation of pro/latent-Myostatin, a number of biochemical and cellular assays were established. Binding kinetics to pro- and latent- Myostatin was measured by ForteBio Octet, in which the biotinylated substrate protein was immobilized on streptavidin coated sensor chips. The equilibrium dissociation constants of candidates from screening are shown in Table 3.</p>To measure the ability of the IgGs to inhibit Myostatin signaling, a Myostatin activation assay was developed. Conditioned medium from cells overexpressing either mT112 (the tolloid protease require for Myostatin activation) or Furin (the proprotein convertase which cleaves the mature growth factor from the prodomain) were produced. Following pre-incubation with the test antibody, pro/latent-Myostatin or latent Myostatin was incubated with either a mixture of mT112 and Furin conditioned media (proMyostatin) or mT112 conditioned media (latent Myostatin).

The changes to these molecules included germlining mutations to the parental variable region, along with mutations in the CDRs which conferred increased binding to pro/latent-Myostatin in the affinity maturation screen (see Example 1).</p>The Ab1 variants were screened in several different ELISA-based assays, in which the binding to the proMyostatin and latent Myostatin proteins (human, murine, and cynomolgus) was re-assessed, along with a large screen of negative control proteins to verify that non-specific binding was not introduced as a result of the affinity maturation. Negative controls included GDF11 proteins (proGDF11, latent GDF11 and mature GDF11), TGF I3 proteins, and Activin proteins (proActivin). Additionally, the antibodies were assessed for polyspecificity (which can lead to rapid clearance) in a screen similar to that published previously (Hotzel et al., 2012). Any antibodies with significant interactions to negative control proteins, or with baculovirus particles in the polyspecificity screen were not considered further as candidates for a development program.</p>The 24 optimized variants of Ab1 were also assessed in the proMyostatin activation assay to determine their functional efficacy, and EC50 values from dose response curves were compared to the parental Ab1 antibody. Most antibodies had equivalent or improved EC50 values, with a few displaying reduced efficacy in this assay. Those with reduced efficacy in the activity assay were excluded from further analysis.</p>Three variants of Ab1 with improved binding to pro- and latent myostatin while retaining specificity for pro- and latent myostatin were identified. Binding and activity data for these three variants and the parental Ab1 molecule are summarized in Tables 4-7, sequences are shown in Example 1.</p>TABLE 4Binding characteristics of antibodies to human/cynomolgus/mouseproMyostatin to parental Ab1 IgG4.Ab1Activity Assay -Kinetics Analysis -293T cellsFortebio OctetEC50 (\u03bcM)kon (1/Ms)kdis (1/s)Kd (M)Human0.2744.18E+051.99E\u2212034.76E\u221209Cynomolgus0.58423.05E+051.75E\u2212035.75E\u221209Mouse0.83862.37E+052.62E\u2212031.10E\u221208</p>TABLE 5Binding characteristics of antibodies to human/cynomolgus/mouseproMyostatin to Ab1 IgG4 with the correct germline residuesreplaced (Ab2) for non-germlined residues.Ab2Activity Assay -Kinetics Analysis -293T cellsFortebio OctetEC50 (\u03bcM)kon (1/Ms)kdis (1/s)Kd (M)Human0.2484.57E+051.56E\u2212033.42E\u221209Cynomolgus0.61682.78E+051.41E\u2212035.08E\u221209Mouse0.71382.35E+051.97E\u2212038.39E\u221209</p>TABLE 6Binding characteristics of antibodies tohuman/cynomolgus/mouse proMyostatin to Ab3 IgG4containing the corrected germline residues (Ab4).Ab4Activity Assay -Kinetics Analysis -293T cellsFortebio OctetEC50 (\u03bcM)kon (1/Ms)kdis (1/s)Kd (M)Human0.1794.98E+052.35E\u2212044.72E\u221210Cynomolgus0.44513.01E+052.34E\u2212047.76E\u221210Mouse0.44662.53E+052.72E\u2212041.08E\u221209</p>TABLE 7Binding characteristics of antibodies tohuman/cynomolgus/mouse proMyostatin to Ab5IgG4 containing the corrected germline residues (Ab6).Ab6Activity Assay -Kinetics Analysis -293T cellsFortebio OctetEC50 (nM)kon (1/Ms)kdis (1/s)Kd (M)Human0.1515.27E+052.51E\u2212044.77E\u221210Cynomolgus0.40373.50E+052.57E\u2212047.35E\u221210Mouse0.30682.94E+052.81E\u2212049.54E\u221210</p>Cell-Based, Ex Vivo and In Vivo Biological Activity AssaysAb1 optimized variants were assessed in the GDF8 activation assay in a dose response study. In these experiments, 0.5 \u03bcM proMyostatin was pre-incubated with increasing amounts of the test article. Following this pre-incubation step, conditioned media from HEK293 cells overexpressing the mT112 and Furin proteases was added to release the mature growth factor from proMyostatin. Following incubation at 30\u00b0 C. overnight, the material was added to 293T cells carrying a SMAD-based luciferase reporter plasmid, and the activity of the released material was recorded. Data are shown in FIG. 4.</p>Selectivity for Myostatin Over other TGFfl Family Members</p>The selectivity of the candidate antibodies were also assessed by both binding and functional assays to verify the lack of cross reactivity to other members of the TGF\u03b2 family. Human Myostatin and GDF11 share 90% identity in the mature growth factor domain, and 47% identity in the prodomain regions. From the epitope mapping studies, it was determined that the parental Ab1 molecule recognizes an epitope on the prodomain of proMyostatin and latent myostatin because ELISA assays have shown binding of this antibody to a construct consisting of the prodomain of myostatin. Even though the prodomains of myostatin and GDF11 share less than 50% identity, and we do not "
