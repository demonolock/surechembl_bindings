    "ce. \u201cStop site\u201d indicates the 3\u2032-most nucleoside to which the modified oligonucleotide is complementary in the target nucleic acid sequence. Each modified oligonucleotide listed in the table below is 100% complementary to SEQ ID NO: 3 (GENBANK Accession No. NM_015760.5).</p>TABLE\u20032Reduction\u2003of\u2003NOX4\u2003RNA\u2003by\u20033-10-3\u2003cEt\u2003modified\u2003oligonucleotides\u2003with\u2003uniform\u2003phosphorothioateinternucleoside\u2003linkages\u2003at\u2003a\u2003concentration\u2003of\u20034000\u2003nM\u2003in\u2003b.END\u2003cellsSEQ\u2003IDSEQ\u2003IDCompoundNo:\u20033No:\u20033NOX4SEQNumberStartSiteStop\u2003SiteSequence\u2003(5\u2032\u2003to\u20033\u2032)(%\u2003UTC)AIDID\u2003NO806009\u2003346\u2003361CACAATCCTAGGCCCA67A307 80607212591274ACACATTGTGAGAGTA\u200324+D308</p>Example 2: Dose-Dependent Reduction of Mouse NOX4 in b.END Cells by Modified OligonucleotidesModified oligonucleotides selected from the examples above were tested at various doses in b.END cells. Cultured b.END cells at a density of 20,000 cells per well were treated by electroporation with various concentrations of modified oligonucleotide as specified in the tables below. After a treatment period of approximately 24 hours, total RNA was isolated from the cells, and NOX4 RNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time RTPCR. Mouse NOX4 primer-probe set RTS35168 (described herein above) was used to measure RNA levels as described above. NOX4 RNA levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\u00ae. Reduction of NOX4 RNA is presented in the tables below as percent NOX4 RNA, relative to the amount of NOX4 RNA in untreated control cells (% UTC).</p>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of each modified oligonucleotide was calculated using a linear regression on a log/linear plot of the data in Excel and is also presented in the tables below.</p>TABLE 3Dose-dependent reduction of mouse NOX4 RNAin b.END cells by modified oligonucleotidesCompoundNOX4 RNA (% UTC)IC<sub>50</sub>No.741 nM2222 nM6667 nM20000 nM(\u03bcM)806013392473&lt;0.7806034241011&lt;0.7806070331251&lt;0.7806114291144&lt;0.780613018532&lt;0.7806134361563&lt;0.780615416633&lt;0.780618119943&lt;0.7806194281061&lt;0.780620114732&lt;0.780620221842&lt;0.7806210241142&lt;0.780622119942&lt;0.7806225321284&lt;0.780624021731&lt;0.780626119631&lt;0.780627718543&lt;0.780628513742&lt;0.7</p>TABLE 4Dose-dependent reduction of mouse NOX4 RNAin b.END cells by modified oligonucleotidesCompoundNOX4 RNA (% UTC)IC<sub>50</sub>No.741 nM2222 nM6667 nM20000 nM(\u03bcM)806036221453&lt;0.7806044341562&lt;0.7806052411541&lt;0.7806059311341&lt;0.7806063291522&lt;0.7806064532384&lt;0.7806110624030171.448061204322122&lt;0.7806131361792&lt;0.7806143211242&lt;0.7806163321553&lt;0.7806171341352&lt;0.7806179261053&lt;0.780618729964&lt;0.780621214621&lt;0.7806220351372&lt;0.780624025521&lt;0.7806260281331&lt;0.780626724621&lt;0.7</p>Example 3: Effect of a Modified Oligonucleotide Complementary to Mouse NOX4 in a Short-Term Cigarette Smoke Model of COPDTwo groups of eight, 10-week old male Balb/c mice (Taconic) were exposed to cigarette smoke (24 cigarettes per day) for a total of 4"
