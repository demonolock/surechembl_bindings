{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value.

{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention also show more than 100-fold selectivity against CCR1, CCR5, CCR7.

However, there is one sentence that mentions IC50 but does not provide a specific numeric value or unit:\n\n\nIC50=A1 \u03bcM<B10 \u03bcM<C\n\n\nThis sentence does not meet the criteria because it does not provide a specific numeric value for the metric."}
