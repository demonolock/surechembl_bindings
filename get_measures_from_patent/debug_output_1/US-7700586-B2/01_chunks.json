The cloned CCR3 cDNA was constructed with pcDNA3 vector and transfected into a K562 cell line. The human CCR3-transformed K562 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Cat.#22400-089, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS (Cat.#A-1115-L, Hyclone), 55 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol (Cat.#21985-023, Life Technologies), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Cat.#11360-070, Life Technologies), 100 units/ml of penicillin G and 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin (Cat.#15140-122, Life Technologies), and 0.4 mg/ml of Geneticin (Cat.#10131-035, Life Technologies) (hereinafter called \u201cculture medium\u201d). Before the receptor binding assay, cells were pretreated with 5 mM sodium butyrate (Cat.#193-01522, Wako)-containing the culture medium (2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) for 20-24 hours to increase the expression of CCR3.\n</p>(2) Receptor Binding Assay (RBA)\nButyrate-pretreated cells, suspended in binding buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 nM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>) at a cell density of 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, were added into 60 \u03bcl/well in the 96-well round bottom polypropylene plate (Cat.#3365, Costar). Compounds, diluted with the binding buffer (4-times higher concentration of the final concentration), were added into 30 \u03bcl/well in the polypropylene plate. [<sup>125</sup>I]-labeled human eotaxin (Cat.#IM290, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), diluted with the binding buffer at the concentration of 0.4 nM (final concentration; 0.1 nM), was added into 30 \u03bcl/well in the polypropylene plate. Total 120 \u03bcl/well of binding reaction mixture (60 \u03bcl/well of cell suspension, 30 \u03bcl/well of compound solution, and 30 \u03bcl/well of (<sup>125</sup>I]-labeled eotaxin) were incubated in the polypropylene plate for 1 hour at room temperature after the incubation, 100 \u03bcl/well of the reaction mixture was transferred to a filtration plate (Cat.#MAFB-N0B, Millipore), and washed with the washing buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 m CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 M NaCl) twice. The 96-well filtration plate was pretreated with 100 \u03bcl/well of 0.5% polyethylenimine (Cat.#P-3143, Sigma) for 2-4 hours at room temperature and washed with the washing buffer twice before use. The non-specific binding was determined by parallel incubation in the presence of 500 nM of non-labeled eotaxin (Cat.#23209, Genzyme Techne). The radioactivities remained on the filter were measured by liquid scintillation counter (TopCount\u2122, Packard) after an addition of 45 \u03bcl/well of scintillant (Microscint20, Cat.#6013621, Packard). The inhibition percent at each concentration of compound was calculated and IC50 values were determined from the inhibition curve.\n\n[Determination of IC50 Values of Compounds in Calcium Mobilization assay] (IC<sub>50 </sub>Ca2+)\n\n</p>(1) Cell\nHuman CCR3-transformed K562 cells were used. The human CCR3-transformed K562 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 55 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol (Cat.921985-023, Life Technologies), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml of penicillin G and 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin and 0.4 mg/ml of Geneticin. Before the calcium mobilization assay, cells were pretreated with 5 mM sodium butyrate-containing the culture medium (2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) for 20-24 hours to increase the expression of CCR3.\n</p>(2) Calcium Mobilization Assay\nButyrate-pretreated cells were loaded with Fluo-3AM (Cat.#F-1242, Molecular Probes) in loading buffer (Hanks' solution Cat.#05906 Nissui, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM probenecid Cat.#P-8761 Sigma, 1 \u03bcM Fluo-3AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127 Cat.#P-6866 Molecular Probes) at a cell density of 1\u00d710<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml. Then, cells were washed with calcium assay buffer (Hanks' solution Cat.#05906 Nissui, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM Probenecid Cat.#P-8761 Sigma). The cell suspension (3.3\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) was added into 60 \u03bcl/well in the 96-well clear bottom black plate (Cat.#3904, Costar). Compounds, diluted (5-times concentration of the final concentration) with the calcium assay buffer, were added into 20 \u03bcl/well in the plate 10 minutes before assay. Human recombinant eotaxin, diluted with the calcium assay buffer at the concentration of 50 nM (final concentration; 10 nM), was added into in a polypropylene plate (Cat.#3365, Costar). Mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium was measured by FDSS-6000 or FDSS-3000(Hamamatsu Photonics) over 60 sec after the stimulation with 10 nM eotaxin. The inhibition percent at the each concentration of compound was calculated, and IC50 values were determined from the inhibition curve.\n\n[Determination of IC50 Values of Compounds in Chemotaxis Assay]\n\n</p>(1) Cell\nHuman CCR3-transformed L1.2 cells were used. Human CCR3-expressing L1.2 stable transformant was established by electroporation, referring to the methods described in J. Exp. Med. 183:2437-2448, 1996. The human CCR3-transformed L1.2 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G and 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.4 mg/ml of Geneticin. One day before the chemotaxis assay, cells were pretreated with 5 mM sodium butyrate-containing culture medium (5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) for 20-24 hours to increase the expression of CCR3.\n</p>(2) Chemotaxis Assay\nButyrate-pretreated cells were suspended in chemotaxis buffer (Hanks' solution Cat.#05906 Nissui, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.1% human serum albumin Cat.#A-1887 Sigma) at a cell density of 1.1\u00d710<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml. A mixture of 90 \u03bcl of cell suspension and 10 \u03bcl of compound solution diluted with chemotaxis buffer (10-times concentration of the final concentration) were preincubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The mixture of cells and compounds was added into the upper chamber of the 24-well chemotaxis chamber (Transwell\u2122, Cat.#3421, Costar, pore size; 5 \u03bcm). 0.5 ml of 10 nM of human recombinant eotaxin(Cat.#23209, Genzyme Techne) solution, diluted with chemotaxis buffer, was added into the lower chamber of the chemotaxis plate. Then, chemotaxis was performed in CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. After 4 hrs incubation, migrated cells were counted using FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The inhibition percent at the each concentration of compound was calculated, and IC50 values were determined from the inhibition curve.\n</p>[Selectivity Test]</p>Selectivity test was done in calcium mobilization assay and in receptor binding assay by using CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CCR8, CXCR1 and PAR-1 (peptidase activate receptor) stable transformants. Methods for the test are the same as that of CCR3. Only the difference is that different stable transformants were used for these selectivity tests.</p>[Determination of IC50 Values of Compounds in Chemotaxis Assay with the Use of Human Eosinophils]</p>Human eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood. Twenty five ml of heparinized blood was layered on 15 ml of Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (#16-980-49DN, ICN Biomedicals Co. Ltd, Japan) in 50 ml tube (#2335-050, Iwaki, Japan) gently and then centrifuged at 400G, for 20 min, at room temperature. After centrifugation, red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte pellet was incubated with anti-human CD16 Microbeads (#130-045-701, Milteynyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. After washing the cells, magnetically labeled neutrophils were then depleted by applying the cell suspension to BS columns (#130-041-304, Milteynyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) attached to VarioMACS (#130-090-282, Milteynyi Biotec GmbH, Germany).</p>Chemotaxis assay with the use of the obtained eosinophils was done by the same protocols as that using CCR3 stable transformants, L1.2 cells.</p>[Primate Chronic Asthma Model: Protocol]</p>Materials and Methods: The animals used in this study were wild caught, adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) weighing 4.0 to 9.0 kg (Charles River BRF, Inc.). All animals studied demonstrated a naturally occurring respiratory sensitivity to inhaled Ascaris suum extract. Animals were housed individually in environmentally controlled rooms in open mesh cages and provided food twice daily and water ad libitum. Each animal was fasted for approximat",
    "each monkey was placed in the supine position and a fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus Optical, model 3C-10, Lake Success, N.Y.) was guided past the carina and wedged into a fifth to seventh generation bronchus. A total of 15 ml of bicarbonate buffered saline (pH 7.4) was infused and gently aspirated through a channel in the bronchoscope. Collected samples were immediately centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in Ca++ and Mg++ free Hank's balanced salt solution. To avoid possible effects of the BAL procedure on lung cellular composition, BAL was performed on alternating right and left lungs. Total white cells per milliliter of BAL fluid was obtained using a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Miami, Fla.). BAL cell composition was determined by counting a minimum of 200 cells from a Wright's stained cytospin slide preparation.</p>Blood Samples: Blood samples were collected prior to and 30 minutes, 1 hr and 2 hr after the first dose of the test compounds (morning of day 2), immediately before each subsequent dose, and 30 minutes, 1 hr and 2 hr after the final dose (evening of day 9). Blood was collected from the femoral vein into EDTA, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. and the plasma stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until assayed for the test compounds.</p>Statistical Analysis: All data were evaluated statistically with the use of students t-test where a p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>Results of receptor binding assay (RBA), Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization assay (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are shown in Examples and tables of the Examples below.
