Recombinant human 17\u03b2-HSD13 was expressed and purified from sf9 cells at Charles River Labs (Saffron Walden, UK). Leukotriene B4 (Catalog# 71160-24-2) and 12-oxoleukotriene B4 (Catalog# 20140) were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). NAD+ (Catalog# N8285), BSA (Catalog# A7030), DMSO (Catalog# D2650), and Tween-20 (Catalog# 11332465001) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Formic acid (Catalog# 28905) was from ThermoFisher Scientific and 384 deep well PP microplates (Catalog# 784261) were from Greiner Bio-One. In a typical IC50 assay performed in a 384w PP microplate, test compounds (0 - 100 \u00b5M) were incubated with HSD17B13 (80 nM), LTB4 (10 \u00b5M), and NAD<sup>+</sup> (0.5 mM) in 10 \u00b5L assay buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), BSA (0.005%), and Tween-20 (0.01%)) at RT for 3 h. The assays were quenched by adding 20 \u00b5L of 0.15% aqueous formic acid and the plates were frozen at -80 \u00baC. RF/MS analysis was performed at PureHoney Technologies (Billerica, MA) on a RapidFire RF300 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) coupled to an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex) equipped with Agilent RapidFire cartridge type A (C<sub>4</sub>). The mobile phase was 0.09% formic acid and 0.01% trifluoracetic acid in water (Buffer A) and 0.09% formic acid and 0.01% trifluoracetic acid in 80% aqueous acetonitrile (Buffer B). The RapidFire method conditions were the following: 250 ms aspirate, 3000 ms load/desalt, 4000 ms elute, and 500 ms re-equilibrate. RF-MS/MS was performed in negative polarity (\u22124500 V), the source temperature was 650 \u00b0C, and gas 1 and gas 2 settings for nitrogen were set to 50. The curtain gas and collision gas were also nitrogen and were set to 20 and 12, respectively. Leukotriene B4 (335.3) and 12-oxoLeukotriene B4 (333.3) SRM transitions were optimized with Discovery Quant software and extracted ion counts for these analytes were determined. Data Analysis.17\u03b2-HSD13 enzyme activity was measured as percent conversion of extracted ion counts and normalized to high and low controls to determine percent residual activity at various concentrations of test compounds. Data were fitted to normalized activity (variable slope) versus concentration fit in GraphPad Prism 7 to determine IC50. All experiments were run in duplicates. By using the above method, the inhibition of 17\u03b2-HSD13 was evaluated for the compounds of Formula (I). IC50 ranges are as follows: A is &lt; 0.1 \u03bcM; B is 0.1 \u03bcM - 1.0 \u03bcM; C is1.0 \u03bcM - 10 \u03bcM; and D is &gt; 10 \u03bcM. \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000083_0001\" path=\"imgf000083_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1175665294/WO/20231102/A1/002023/21/20/19/imgf000083_0001.tif\"/>\n While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims. \n</p>"
