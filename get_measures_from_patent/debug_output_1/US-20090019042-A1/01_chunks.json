A very big problem of this approach resides in that because molecular mechanisms utilizing RNAs having functions are usually Subiquitously present in the human body, such compounds targeting such RNAs cannot become pharmaceuticals for treating particular diseases. Hence, such compounds can be developed only as antibiotics utilizing the species difference. It is also problematic that the low-molecular compounds thus obtained behave remarkably differently from existing protein-targeting pharmaceuticals so that it is difficult to take appropriate measures in synthesis.</p>Since it has recently been realized that drug discovery is possible for RNAs that \u201chave a (function and) structure\u201d as described above, drug discovery research into structures on mRNAs has been conducted. In the 21st century, gene expression regulatory mechanisms based on interactions between mRNAs and low-molecular compounds (riboswitch) has been observed experimentally in prokaryotic organisms (WO 2004/027035). To date, it has been reported that such mechanisms are present for vitamin B12, thiamin pyrophosphate, FMN, S-adenosylmethionine, guanine, adenine, L-lysine, and glucosamine-6-phosphate. For example, in B. subtilis, it is considered that a minimum of 2% (putatively not less than 10%) of the total gene expression thereof is under the control of the riboswitch mode. The xpt-pbux mRNA of B. subtilis recognizes guanine, which has a molecular weight of as low as 151.13, at the nM level (Kd&lt;5 nM). Moreover, LysC mRNA selectively recognizes L-lysine (molecular weight 146.19; Kd=1 \u03bcM), though it is not even a derivative of RNA. These low-molecular substances are capable of controlling gene expression by being coordinated to mRNAs to alter the secondary and tertiary structures of the mRNAs. In the mechanism for glucosamine-6-phosphate, the mRNA exhibits ribozyme-like self-cleavage to irreversibly inactivate the mRNA. For these mechanisms, attempts for drug discovery with modification of natural products are being made.</p>On the other hand, it has been reported that in an artificial system comprising aptamer motifs experimentally introduced to mRNAs, protein translation in eukaryotic organisms can be suppressed using low-molecular compounds that bind to the motifs. These facts can be viewed as suggesting feasibility of drug discovery for low-molecular pharmaceuticals that target mRNA molecules.</p>Furthermore, in 2002 and 2004, drug discovery for structures on natural mRNAs was reported. The Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is the responsible gene for Alzheimer's disease, and it had been known that a somewhat stable local higher order structure (motif) is present on the mRNA thereof. Hence, screening for low-molecular compounds was performed using a reporter gene incorporating the motif, and hit compounds that suppress the translation level by not less than 95% were obtained (Rogers, J. T. et al., J. Mol. Neurosci., 19, 77-82 (2002)). VEGF, a cancer-related gene, had also been known to have an IRES-like higher order structure. Scree"
