PNAS 88:8099 (1991). </p>\n  One specific essential HSV gene that is placed under\nthe control of the tissue-specific\ntranscriptional regulatory sequence is the ICP4 gene,\nwhich is also known as the Vmw175, or IE-3, or IE175\ngene or \u03b14. ICP4 encodes a 175 kD protein that is the\nmain trans-activator of HSV transcription and essential\nfor lytic growth of the virus. Mutants lacking ICP4 fail\nto synthesize early or late viral polypeptides. Preston,\nC.M. (1979) J. Virol. 29:275-284. DeLuca, N.A. et al.\n(1985) supra.</p>\n  One possible HSV backbone that is used for the\nrecombinant vector of the instant invention is G92A,\nwhich came from d120, an HSV-1 KOS derived deletion\nmutant of the ICP4 gene. d120 can only grow on ICP4\ncomplementing cell lines, such as E5. DeLuca, N.A. et\nal. (1985) J. Virol. 56:558-570.</p>\n  To control for revertants, viral stocks are prepared\non the target cell from the initial isolation of the\nrecombinant. There would be no possibility of reversion\nof the ICP4 deletion, when the vector is grown on target\ncells. Reversions do occur, however, at low frequency in\nthe E5 cells because E5 cells contain an integrated ICP4\ngene. This strategy is used for various target cells,\nonce it has been determined that the promoter is\ndirecting ICP4 expression in a cell-specific fashion and\nthe recombinant has been isolated. This could be done by\nisolating recombinants on E5 cells first and then\nchecking for specificity.</p>\n  Not all the vectors need to be non-neurovirulent\nbecause for targeting to some tumor types, it is unlikely\nthat the virus will get into the CNS. However, the\nvectors of the instant invention can also include the\nsafety features disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 08/264,581.\nThe inability of the recombinant HS"
