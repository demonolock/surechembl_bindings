    " C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 \u03bcl of 2M citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, at 4\u00b0 C. The sample was chromatographed on a Biogel P-10 column in sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5 (15 drops/fraction), at 4\u00b0 C. to separate the free iodine.</p>The iodinated peptide was dissolved in water and treated with 2-pyridinethiol 1-oxide (10:1 moles) for 5 h at room temperature to remove the protecting groups. The deprotected labelled peptide was purified on a Biogel P-10 column. Three radioactive peaks were obtained, the first two of which were immunoactive with rabbit antithymopoietin antibody. The first peak was then applied to a 1\u00d760 cm column of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 that had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0. The iodination mixture was eluted with this buffer using a linear gradient of increasing ionic strength from the equilibration concentration up to 1.0M. The radioactivity of each fraction was determined using an LKB 1280 Ultra gamma spectrometer.</p>Fractions with peak radioactivity from each purification scheme were analyzed for binding with excess antithymopoietin antibody. Fractions from peak II (fractions 35-45) of the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column showed the highest specific binding and were used subsequently in the radioreceptor assay.</p>Iodinated thymopoietin retained biological activity as determined by assessing its effect in a neuromuscular assay (Goldstein, Nature, 247, 11-14 (1974)) and its effect on the synthesis of cyclic GMP by CEM cells.</p>Binding Assay--The assay buffer was prepared by adding 12 g Hepes, 1.2 g MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 1.2 g BSA to 1000 ml of glass distilled water. A pH of 7.65 was obtained using 1N NaOH. The stock standard solution was made using assay buffer and was used for one week. The assay was performed in 12\u00d775 mm glass test tubes by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of standard solution, 25 \u03bcl of receptor protein (150-200 \u03bcg/ml), 25 \u03bcl <sup>125</sup> I-TP (80,000 cpm)) 20 \u03bcl of 1 percent Triton X-100, and the volume was made up to 200 \u03bcl with assay buffer. After incubation for 18 h at 4\u00b0 C., 200 \u03bcl of human IgG (1.5 mg/ml) (as carrier) and 200 \u03bcl of 35 percent PEG-8000 in PBS, pH 7.56, were added, mixed, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The tubes were centrifuged and the residue was washed with 10 percent PEG in PBS, pH 7.3, and counted in an LKB-gamma counter.</p>The radioactivity in the precipitate in the presence of 1 mg/ml nonradioactive thymopoietin was taken to represent nonspecific binding. TCA was added to the supernatant (final concentration 5 percent) and precipitable radioactivity was measured. At all times this exceeded 95 percent, indicating minimal release of free <sup>125</sup> I from the tracer.</p>Competition Experiments--Following the above binding assay procedure, 2.3\u00d710<sup>-10</sup> M of <sup>125</sup> I-TP was incubated with 4 \u03bcg of receptor protein and test peptide together with the same concentration of the thymopoietin 37-45 nonapeptide (H-VAL-GLU-LEU-TYR-LEU-GLN-SER-LEU-TNR-OH). The incubation was continued for 12 h, after which free and bound <sup>125</sup> I-TP were determined as above. The nonapeptide is used to block an adjacent receptor site on the receptor protein. If this adjacent receptor site is not blocked, some labelled TP can bind to the receptor protein through this site even if the thymopentin receptor site is blocked by the test peptide. Such binding is unrelated to the activity of the test peptide and (if not blocked by the TP 37-45 nonapeptide) would yield inaccurate results.</p>The following representative compounds of the invention caused displacement at least 50% of that caused by thymopoietin self-displacement at equivalent concentrations:</p>H-ARG-LYS-ASP-VAL-PHE-OH;</p>N-\u03b1-acetyl-ARG-PRO-ASP-VAL-PHE-OH;</p>N-\u03b1-formyl-ARG-PRO-ASP-VAL-PHE-OH;</p>N-ARG-PRO-ASP-VAL-PHE-OH;</p>H-ARG-LYS-ASP-VAL-HIS-OH;</p>H-ARG-LYS-ASP-VAL-TRP-OH; and</p>H-ARG-LYS-ASP-VAL-TRP-NH<sub>2</sub></p>For comparison, other peptides such as insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, somatostatin, \u03b2-endorphin, FTS, ACTH, CRF, and ubiquitin caused no detectable displacement.</p>The above Examples have been presented for illustrative purposes only and not to limit the scope of the present invention, which scope is set out "
