    "lymer solution in 1 mL of acidified (pH\u02dc3) 100 mM NaCl solution and titrating to pH 11 with 5 \u03bcL increments of a 25 mM KOH solution. For the titration, the pH was determined using a Mettler Toledo InLab Ultra-Micro pH Probe. pKa value for each polymer was determined by plotting the \u0394pH/volume of KOH (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and identifying the largest \u0394pH. For polymers with two maxima, the volume of the median point between the two maxima was chosen as the point where pH=pKa. For random-Bz-G (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) and block-Bz-G, no deprotonation of the cationic moiety occurs and therefore titration curves are only representative of the change in pH of solution.</p><heading id=\"h-0028\">Fluorescent Quenching Titration</heading><p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0124\">The complexation between the PNs and protein was studied by monitoring the fluorescence emission intensity (Ex: 540 nm; Em: 576 nm) of rhodamine-labelled bovine serum albumin (Rho-BSA) as a functional of increasing concentrations of PNs. Rhodamine quenching was indicative of protein binding. Briefly, polymer solutions in DMSO were serially diluted in DMSO and further diluted in H<sub>2</sub>O. Emission of Rho-BSA solutions was taken before and after the addition of polymer solutions, and the relative emission intensity as a function of polymer concentration was plotted. Final concentration of Rho-BSA was 100 nM and of polymers ranged from 32-0.5 \u03bcM.</p><heading id=\"h-0029\">Dissociation Constant Determination</heading><p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0125\">The dissociation constant was determined by converting the relative fluorescence quenching plots to fractional saturation plots using equation 1 below:</p><p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0000\"><maths id=\"MATH-US-00001\" num=\"00001\"><math overflow=\"scroll\"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mrow><mi>Fractional</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>   </mtext><mrow><mi>Saturation</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>P</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>sat</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></maths></p><p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0126\">where F<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>P</sub>, and F<sub>sat </sub>were the relative emission intensities of Rho-BSA only, polymer/Rho-BSA complexes at the various concentrations tested, and polymer/Rho-BSA at saturation.

Briefly, 40 \u03bcL of complexes were prepared by mixing equal volumes of polymer and Rho-BSA solutions and allowing them to complex for 30 m. These complexes were then diluted into 360 \u03bcL of either PBS or PBS with 10% FBS and the emission spectra was recorded "
