    "se to the administration of a motoneuronotropic factor (MNTF) analogue to a patient or to a target organ, tissue, or cell. Cysteine aspartyl proteases related to the C. elegans CED-3 death protein comprise the caspase family. All are expressed as proenzymes which are activated by proteolysis. With respect to their roles in apoptosis, Caspases can be subdivided into initiator (Caspases 8, 9, 10) and effector (Caspases 3, 6, 7) caspases, depending on whether they are activated by receptor clustering (initiator) or by mitochondrial permeability transition (effector). Effector caspases, most notably Caspase 3, cleave numerous substrates to effect the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Among Caspase 3 substrates are DFF45/ICAD, which frees up the DNAse subunit of DFF to cause chromatin degradation, as well as gelsolin, PAK2, D4GDI, all of which are involved in cytoskeletal organization, nuclear lamins and PARP. The significance of PARP cleavage is not clear, but it is an excellent marker for caspase activation and the presumption of ongoing apoptosis.</p>\n  [00106] In certain embodiments, a RAS gene product expression or activity is modulated in response to the administration of a motoneuronotropic factor (MNTF) analogue to a patient or to a target organ, tissue, or cell. Ras proteins are small GTP-binding proteins \n\nwhich unlike the heterotrimeric G-proteins contain all GTPase and effector functions within a single polypeptide. At least three isoforms of Ras exist, Ki-Ras, Ha-Ras, and N-Ras, with distinct expression patterns but similar signaling activity. Ras is palmitoylated and farnesylated at the carboxy terminus, anchoring it in the membrane. In resting cells, Ras is loaded with GDP, and is activated subsequent to growth factor stimulation of receptors, which recruit Ras Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors to the plane of the membrane. Proximity of exchange factors to the Ras proteins causes release of GDP, and its replacement by GTP. In its GTP- bound form, Ras binds several proteins, including Raf, RaIGDS, and PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of Ras occurs by GTP hydrolysis, which is greatly accelerated by RasGAP or NF-I, two known Ras GTPase Activating Proteins. It is possible to assay for Ras activation by incubation of lysates with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1, which selectively binds to Ras:GTP.</p>\n  HI. Stem cell cultures</p>\n  [00107] Embryonic stem (ES) cells are cultured cells, derived from the pluripotent inner cell mass of blastocyst stage embryos, that are capable of replicating indefinitely. In general, ES cells have the potential to differentiate into other cells (i.e., they are pluripotent); thus, they may serve as a continuous source of new cells. Embryonic stem cells for use in the present invention may be obtained from any animal, but is preferably obtained from a mammal (e.g., human, domestic animal, or commercial animal). In one embodiment of the present invention, the embryonic stem cell is a murine embryonic stem",
    "ffected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of compounds provided herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. For example, for determining The LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD5<sub>0</sub> /ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissues in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>\n  [00175] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half- maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. Dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual compounds, including MNTF peptides and MNTF analogues, and can generally be estimated based on EC50 s found to be effective in vitro and in in vivo animal models. One of skill in the art will recognize that preferred dosages will vary depending on how and where an MNTF peptide is administered (e.g. in vitro, in vivo, topically, systemically, etc.). \n\n [00176] For example, in one aspect, MNTF peptides and MNTF analogues may be administered to achieve from about 0.01 micrograms per ml (\u03bcg/mL) to about 1 mg per ml, from about O.l\u03bcg/mL to about 50 \u03bcg/mL, from about O.l\u03bcg/mL to about 150 \u03bcg/mL, from about 1 \u03bcg/mL to about 200 \u03bcg/mL, and from about O.l\u03bcg/mL to about 500 \u03bcg/mL, including any range within these ranges, final concentrations at a target site (e.g. in a cell culture of ES stem cells).</p>\n  [00177] Alternative suitable dosage amounts may, for example, vary from about 0.1 ug up to a total dose of about 1 gram, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and generally available to practitioners in the art. Those skilled in the art will employ different formulations for nucleotides than for proteins or their inhibitors. Similarly, delivery of polynucleotides, polypeptides, and compounds provided herein will be specific to particular cells, conditions, and locations. In general, dosage generally ranges from 0.01 mg/kg to 1000 mg per kg of body weight, and more typically, for example, from 0.1 mg/kg to 300 mg per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, month"
