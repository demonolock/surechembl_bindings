U.S.A., 85, 5879-5883 (1988) and Bird et al., Science, 242, 423-426 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference). (See, generally, Hood et al., \"Immunology\", Benjamin, N.Y., 2nd ed. (1984), and Hunkapiller and Hood, Nature, 323, 15-16 (1986),). This term also encompasses so-called \"phage display\" antibodies.</p>\n  A \"monovalent\" antibody is an antibody that has a single antigen binding region. Fab fragments, scFv antibodies, and phage display antibodies are types of monovalent antibodies, although others are known. A \"Fab\" fragment of an antibody has a single binding region, and may be made by papain digestion of a full length monoclonal antibody. A single chain variable (or \"scFv\") fragment of an antibody is an antibody fragment containing the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins, linked together with a short flexible linker. A \"hybridoma\" is a cell that is a hybrid of a spleen cell or other antibody producing cell and an immortal cell (e.g., a myeloma cell). Hybridomas are both immortal and capable of producing the genetically coded antibody. Hybridomas and methodologies for making hybridomas may be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,420,140 and Harlow, (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, First Edition (1988) Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.) for example. A \"complex\" between an antibody an antigen is characterized by a K<sub>D</sub> (dissociation constant) of less than 10<sup>\"6</sup> M, less than 10<sup>\"7</sup> M, less than 10<sup>\"8</sup> M, less than 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, or less than 10<sup>'9</sup> M.</p>\n  The \"IC3 loop\" of a GPCR is the intracellular loop that is between transmembrane region 5 (TM5) and transmembrane region 6 (TM6) of the GPCR. Such regions are readily identifiable by analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of a GPCR.</p>\n  The terms \"specifically binds\" and \"specific binding\" refer to the ability of an antibody to preferentially bind to a particular antigen that is present in a homogeneous mixture of different antigens. In certain embodiments, a specific binding interaction will discriminate between desirable and undesirable antigens in a sample, in some embodiments more than about 10 to 100-fold or more (e.g., more than about 1000- or 10,000-fold).</p>\n  An antibody that specifically binds to a \"three dimensional\" epitope or \"conformational\" epitope is an antibody that specifically binds to a tertiary (i.e., three dimensional) structure a folded protein. Such an antibody binds at much reduced (i.e., by a factor of at least 2, 5, 10, 50 or 100) affinity to the linear (i.e., unfolded, denatured) form of \n\n the protein. The structure to which such an antibody binds contains amino acids that are discontiguous in the protein. In other words, binding of such an antibody to a polypeptide is dependent upon the polypeptide being folded into a particular three dimensional conformation.</",

As such, antibodies binding to IC3 may stabilize a specific conformation of TM5 relative to TM6 that would be detected by a change in tetramethylrhodamine fluorescence. It can be seen that antibody 5 induced the largest fluorescence response and had the highest affinity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence change induced by antibody 5 was significantly greater than the response to antibody 9, the other intracellular binder that reacted weakly to SDS denatured receptor. It is notable that there was a response to antibody 8 and antibody 4, two antibodies that bind to an extracellular epitope. This suggests that binding of these antibodies to the extracellular surface of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR influences the structure around the cytoplasmic end of TM6.</p>\n  Based on the results of assays shown in Figures 2 A and 2B antibody 5 was chosen for crystallography experiments. Antibody 5 bound to an intracellular epitope, it exhibited relatively high affinity for native \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (Fig. 2B), but bound weakly to SDS denatured protein (Fig. 2A). Antibody 5 also induced the largest fluorescence response in \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR labeled at C265 with tetramethylrhodamine. Based on these experiments, antibody 5 binds to a three dimensional epitope on the native third intracellular loop.</p>\n  Example 4 Antibody characterization Fab 5 fragments were generated from purified antibody 5 by papain cleavage and purified by ion exchange chromatography. The dissociation constant for Fab 5 binding to purified \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR was determined to be 150 nM by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 5). As expected, this value is higher than the EC50 (23 nM) observed for the intact antibody in the fluorescence experiments (Fig. 2B). To localize the intracellular epitope of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR that interacts with Fab 5, limited tryptic digestions of purified \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR were performed. Cleavage of purified \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR with trypsin yielded two bands with molecular weights of approximately 27 and 29 kDa on a Western blot probed with the Ml anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A). The sizes of these fragments \n\n indicate trypsin digestion at two often potential sites in IC3 (Fig. 3A). When preincubated with Fab 5, the 27 kDa band disappears suggesting that the antibody binds to one of the amino-terminal trypsin sites in IC3 (Fig. 3A).</p>\n  The effect of Fab binding on ligand binding properties and on agonist-induced three dimensional changes was determined. Fab 5 had no significant effect on antagonist or agonist binding affinity (Table 1 below).</p>\n  [<sup>3</sup>H]dihydroalprenolol Isoproterenol</p>\n  Kj \u00b1 S.E.
