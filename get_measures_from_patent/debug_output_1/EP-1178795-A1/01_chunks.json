Field of the Invention</p>\n  The present invention relates generally to the fields of cancer biology and biochemistry. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a method of cancer chemotherapy in mammals.</p>\n  II. Description of Related Art 1. NSAIDS There is an increasing body of experimental and epidemiological data suggesting that aspirin, and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), exert a chemopreventive action on colorectal cancers and maybe also on stomach, esophagus (Thun et al., 1993) and even bladder (Earnest et al, 1992) cancers. Aspirin, ibuprofen, piroxicam (Reddy et al, 1990; Singh et al, 1994), indomethacin (Narisawa, 1981), and sulindac (Piazza et al, 1997; Rao et al, 1995), effectively inhibit colon carcinogenesis in the AOM-treated rat model and flurbiprofen has demonstrated anti-tumor effects in the APC(Min)+ mouse model (Wechter et al, 1997). NSAIDs also inhibit the development of tumors harboring an activated Ki-r\u03b1s (Singh and Reddy, 1995).</p>\n  NSAIDs appear to inhibit carcinogenesis via the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells</p>\n  (Bedi et al, 1995; Lupulescu, 1996; Piazza et \u03b1/., 1995; Piazza et al, 1997b). A number of studies suggest that the chemopreventive properties of the NSAIDs, including the induction of \n\napoptosis, is a function of their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (reviewed in DuBois et al, 1996; Lupulescu, 1996; Nane and Botting, 1997). It is hypothesized that this may be effected by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, which suppresses the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins (Hinz et al, 1999). Epidemiological and laboratory studies suggest that colon carcinogenesis is, at least in part, mediated through modulation of prostaglandin production by COX isozymes (COX-1 and - 2) (Kawamori, T., et al. 1998). Recent studies, however, indicate that \u039dSALDs may inhibit carcinogenesis through both prostaglandin-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Alberts et al, 1995; Piazza et al, 1991 \u0386; Thompson et al, 1995; Hanif, 1996). Sulindac sulfone, a metabolite of the \u039dSATD sulindac, lacks COX-inhibitory activity yet induces apoptosis in tumor cells (Piazza et al, 1995; Piazza et al., 1997b) and inhibits tumor development in several rodent models of carcinogenesis (Thompson et al., 1995; Piazza et al, 1995, 1997a). It is hypothesized that a potential mechanism of sulindac activity may be the direct or indirect inhibition of tyrosine kinase (W",
