    "oup of drug RPMI-1640 solution containing gradient concentration was added, and co-cultured with each group of drug for 6 hours (Ce 6, CNS group based on mass concentration of chlorin e 6; NLG and Sim based on respective mass concentrations; C+N+S group based on Ce6 concentration, and wherein molar ratio of chlorin e6, NLG919, simvastatin was the same as CNS group). Standard MTT colorimetric method was used for treatment and absorbance at 570nm was measured. </p>The nanoparticles corresponding to example 1 were tested as described above and the result is a in fig. 5. The experimental results show that CNS nanoparticles have little dark toxicity to 4T1 tumor cells in vitro.</p>Further, in order to confirm that CNS nanoparticles have excellent photodynamic therapy effect, 4T1 cells were digested, centrifuged, dispersed, seeded onto 96 well plates with 100 \u03bcl of solution per well containing about 5000 4T1 cells, and cultured for 24 hours. Removing culture medium in the pore plate, adding 100 \u03bcl of RPMI-1640 solution containing gradient concentration of each group of drugs, co-culturing with each group of drugs for 6 hr, and irradiating with light of 630nm wavelength and light source energy density of 29.8mW cm <sup>-2</sup> The illumination time period was 5 minutes. After 24 hours of co-cultivation, treatment was performed using standard MTT colorimetry. The absorbance at 570nm was measured and the result was B in fig. 5. Further, the above experiment was repeated 3 times, and IC50 of Ce6 (+), c+n+s (+), CNS (+) group was calculated, and the result was C in fig. 5. The result shows that the killing effect of CNS nano particles on in-vitro tumor cells under illumination is obviously better than the killing effect of the same amount of three medicaments under superimposed illumination on in-vitro tumor cells.</p>3. Double dyeing test of live/dead </p>1000. Mu.L of 4T1 cells in log phase growth containing 10 cells per 1. Mu.L were seeded12.56cm <sup>2</sup> RPMI-1640 medium (Blank group), 2mg/L of chlorin e6 (Ce 6 group, ce6 (+) group), 1.8mg/L of NLG919 (NLG group), 1.3mg/L of simvastatin (Sim group), 5.1mg/L of CNS nanoparticles (CNS group, CNS (+) group), 2mg/L of each of the three drugs, 1.8mg/L,1.3mg/L of chlorin e6+NLG 919+simvastatin group (C+N+S group, C+N+S (+) group) and 1mL of each of the three drugs were added to the dishes for 24 hours. After culturing for 6h, the Ce6 (+) group, CNS (+) group and C+N+S (+) group are irradiated with light with the wavelength of 630nm and the energy density of the light source of 29.8 mW.cm <sup>-2</sup> The light duration was 15 minutes. The drug-containing medium in each group was removed and cells were washed using RPMI-1640 medium. Staining was performed using a Calcein-AM/PI live/dead double staining kit and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The test result is D in fig. 5. Further, the red fluorescence PI intensities were counted and summarized as E in fig. 5. Significant differences"
