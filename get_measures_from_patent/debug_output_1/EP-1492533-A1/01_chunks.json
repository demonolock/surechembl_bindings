Screen for Lp-PLA2 inhibition.</p>\n  Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the rate of turnover of the artificial substrate (A) at 37 C in 50mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulphonic acid) buffer containing 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. \n\n \n\n</p>\n  (A)</p>\n  Assays were performed in 96 well titre plates. Recombinant LpPLA2 was purified to homogeneity from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells, using a zinc chelating column, blue sepharose affinity chromatography and an anion exchange column. Following purification and ulfrafiltration, the enzyme was stored at 6mg/ml at 4\u00b0C. Assay plates of compound or vehicle plus buffer were set up using automated robotics to a volume of 170\u03bcl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20\u03bcl of lOx substrate (A) to give a final substrate concentration of 20\u03bcM and 10 \u03bcl of diluted enzyme to a final 0.1 nM LpPLA2.</p>\n  The reaction was followed at 405 nm and 37 \u00b0C for 20 minutes using a plate reader with automatic mixing. The rate of reaction was measured as the rate of change of absorbance.</p>\n  Results</p>\n  The compounds described in the Examples were tested as described above and had IC50 values in the range &lt;0.1 to 100 nM. \n</p>\n"
