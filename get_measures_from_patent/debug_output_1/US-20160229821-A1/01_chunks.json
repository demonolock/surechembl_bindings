To a solution of 6-(4-(4-(substituted-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butoxy)-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one 14a in 5 mL dichloromethane was added 2 mL 2M HCl solution in diethyl ether, and then the solution was evaporated at 25\u00b0 C. to give 6-(4-(4-(substituted-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butoxy)-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one hydrochloride 15a. The pure products 15a gave satisfactory 1H NMR and/or Mass spectral data. White solid (0.08 g).

The in vitro assay protocols and literature references are described herein.</p>Dopamine, D<sub>2s </sub>(human recombinant) binding assay</p>Materials and Methods:\nReceptor Source: Human recombinant expressed in CHO cellsRadioligand: [<sup>3</sup>H1Spiperone (20-60 Ci/mmol)Control Compound: HaloperidolIncubation Conditions: The reactions were carried out in 50 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA for 60 minutes at 25 C. The reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. Radioactivity trapped onto the filters was determined and compared to control values in order to ascertain any interactions of test compounds with the cloned dopamine\u2014D<sub>2 </sub>short binding site (Literature Reference: Jarvis, K. R. et al. Journal of Receptor Research 1993, 13(1-4), 573-590; Gundlach, A. L. et al.

The reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. Radioactivity trapped onto the filters was determined and compared to control values in order to ascertain any interactions of test compounds with the cloned serotonin\u20145HT<sub>1A </sub>binding site (Literature Reference: Hoyer, D. et al.
