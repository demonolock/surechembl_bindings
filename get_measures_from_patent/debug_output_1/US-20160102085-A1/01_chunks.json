Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19).</p>The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods.</p>Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a sufficient amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic diluent like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile, or a mixture thereof. Salts of other acids than those mentioned above which for example are useful for purifying or isolating the compounds of the present invention (e.g. trifluoro acetate salts,) also comprise a part of the invention.</p>BIOLOGICAL ASSAYSThe biological activity of compounds was determined by the following methods.</p>A. In vitro Testing of CB2 Potency: CB2 cAMP (Assay 1)</p>CHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1 mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10 uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX-XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1 uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0).</p>B. In vitro Testing of CB1 Potency: CB1 cAMP (Assay 2)</p>CHO cells expressing human CB1 R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C.

Assessment of Efflux in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells Transfected with the Human MDR1 Gene (MDCK Assay) (Assay 3)</p>Apparent permeability coefficients (PE) of the compounds across the MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers are measured (pH 7.4, 37\u00b0 C.) in apical-to-basal (AB) and basal-to-apical (BA) transport direction. AB permeability (PEAB) represents drug absorption from the blood into the brain and BA permeability (PEBA) drug efflux from the brain back into the blood via both passive permeability as well as active transport mechanisms mediated by efflux and uptake transporters that are expressed on the MDCK-MDR1 cells, predominantly by the overexpressed human MDR1 P-gp. The compounds are assigned to permeability/absorption classes by comparison of the AB permeabilities with the AB permeabilities of reference compounds with known in vitro permeability and oral absorption in the human. Identical or similar permeabilities in both transport directions indicate passive permeation, vectorial permeability points to additional active transport mechanisms. Higher PEBA than PEAB indicates the involvement of active efflux mediated by MDR1 P-gp. Active transport is concentration-dependently saturable.</p>MDCK-MDR1 cells (1-2\u00d710e5 cells/1 cm2 area) are seeded on filter",
