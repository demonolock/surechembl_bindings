    "CuSO<sub>4 </sub>is added at 50 \u03bcM and the mixture is allowed to oxidize in air at room temperature for 24 hours. Insoluble material is pelleted and the material is absorbed in batch mode to Ni<sup>2+</sup>-IDA resin (Talon\u2122, Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) for 20 minutes at room temperature, based on the binding capacity of the resin.</p>Total protein concentrations is determined by a modified Bradford assay (Coomassie Plus\u2122, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) in the low level mode with buffer blanks. In the case of detergent interference, a detergent insensitive assay using bicinchoninic acid is used. With this detergent, A<sub>280 </sub>estimates can be made. After adsorption the resin is transferred to a column and washed with 20 column volumes of the solubilizing buffer followed by \u226720 column volumes, or until A<sub>280</sub>&lt;0.02, with 8M urea/50 mM MES, pH=6.0. Bound product is eluted in 8M urea/300 mM imidazole/TrisHCl, pH=7.4. All fractions are saved and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Fractions of sufficient purity then are dialyzed versus 0.4 M arginine/50 \u03bcM CuSo<sub>4</sub>/50 mM TrisHCl, pH=8.0.</p>EXAMPLE 5Assay of Antigen Binding Activity of sIL-15R\u03b1-1F5scF<sub>v </sub>Fusion ProteinAntigen binding activity of the fusion protein is assayed by radiolabeling it with <sup>125</sup>I by the Iodogen method such that specific activity does not exceed 20 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg. Panels of human cell lines that are known to be positive or negative for CD20 are tested in a standard binding assay in the presence and absence of cold 1F5, cold fusion protein and cold IL-15. Binding occurs through the anti-CD20 moiety. After 1 hour on ice the cells are spun through a cushion of 80/20, dibutyl phthalate/olive oil and the tips of the tubes are cut off and counted in a gamma counter.</p>To test for IL-15 binding capacity a cell binding assays is used. A B-cell line with the high expression of CD20 is used. Cold receptor-F<sub>v </sub>fusion protein is allowed to bind for 40 minutes on ice. Cells are washed twice and <sup>125</sup>I-IL-15 are added. IL-15 labeled by the Iodogen method to specific activities of up to 70 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg is added at 1 nM in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of cold IL-15 and cold IL-2 as a negative control (IL-2 does not bind to IL-15R\u03b1). After another 40 minutes on ice, the cells are spun through an oil cushion and counted as above.</p>EXAMPLE 6Assay of Ability of sIL-15R\u03b1-1F5scF<sub>v </sub>Fusion Protein to Internalize CD20The fusion protein and parental IF5 are labeled in parallel with <sup>125</sup>I. The CD20+cell line, RL, is used. Binding is carried out on ice at 5 nM for both labels on equal aliquots of cells. Cold IL-15 or cold IL-2 is added to some tubes to assess the effects on internalization. Unbound labels are removed by pelleting and washing the cells. A t<sub>0 </sub>value is determined and the remaining aliquots are placed at 37\u00b0 C. and removed at various time intervals. Catabolized and released <sup>125</sup>I is d"
