    "), significant reductions in tumor volume following treatment of mice with Dox5(P &lt; 0.0001), Dox5+ dLGG5 (P0.0015) and dLGG25 (P0.0015) were observed compared to tumor control groups. Figure 5B shows that on day 30, tumors were collected and weights were recorded. The tumor weights of the Dox5, Dox5+ dLGG5, CR-API400, dLGG5, and dLGG25 treated groups were significantly lower than the tumor control group. Figure 5C shows representative tumors for all different treatment groups. It was also shown that the other treatment groups reduced the tumor weight by 100% of the tumor weight of the tumor control group (ratio bar: 5 mm).</p>Fig. 6A and 6B show that CR-API and dLGG therapy reduced tumor cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. Representative IHC images of tumor tissue stained with the following antibodies, respectively, and co-stained with nuclear indicator hematoxylin (light blue) are shown: (FIG. 6A) Ki67 (light brown) (a marker protein for cell proliferation), and (FIG. 6B) cleavage caspase 3 (a marker protein for apoptosis) (ratio bar: 50 \u03bcm).</p>Fig. 7A and 7B show that CR-API and dLGG treated mice reduced TNBC metastasis to distant lung organs. Figure 7A shows representative H &amp; E images of lung tissue for all treatment groups. This image shows metastatic tumor nodules were visible in the tumor control, dLGG5 and CR-API200 groups, but not detectable in dLGG25, CR-API400, Dox5 and Dox5+ dLGG5 groups. FIG. 7B is an IHC image analysis showing the presence of a Ki 67-highly expressed metastatic TNBC tumor nodule (scale bar: 50 \u03bcm) in the lungs of the test animals.</p>Fig. 8A and 8B show that CR-API and dLGG treated mice reduced metastasis of TNBC to distant liver organs. Representative H &amp; E images (fig. 8A) and IHC analysis (fig. 8B) of Ki67 overexpressing cells in liver tissue indicated the presence of metastatic tumor nodules in the liver of the tumor control group, which was much less in the compound or extract treated group. Red arrows in the images highlight representative Ki67 over-representation of tumor nodules (scale bar: 50 \u03bcm).</p>FIGS. 9A and 9B show that CR-API and dLGG treatment ameliorated tumor or doxorubicin (Dox) -induced inflammation of the lungs and liver. Representative IHC images of liver (FIG. 9A) and lung (FIG. 9B) tissues of all groups that were immunostained with pro-inflammatory COX-2 indicated that dLGG or CR-API treatment reduced inflammation at the site of tumor or DOx-induced TNBC metastases (ratio bars: 50 \u03bcm).</p>FIG. 10 shows that CR-API and dLGG treatment negatively regulates cancer metastasis-associated signaling in tumor tissue. Western blot analysis results showed that CR-API or dLGG treatment attenuated Src/FAK signaling cascade and affected membrane remodeling of cancer cells and the expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins.</p>Detailed Description</p>The present disclosure provides a method of treating breast cancer and/or treating breast cancer metastasis in a subject in need the",
    "ed every 3 days during the duration of treatment (fig. 4B). On day 30, it was observed that only the Dox5 treated group exhibited significant weight loss (10% of the initial weight of the test animals) compared to all treated groups. This phenomenon was reduced in the Dox5+ dLGG5 treatment group (P \u2550 0.0014), indicating that dLGG ameliorated the weight loss associated with doxorubicin treatment. No significant weight loss was observed for the CR-API or dLGG treated groups alone.</p>dLGG and CR-API dose-dependent reduction of TNBC tumor mass</p>Tumor burden was monitored for all groups throughout the experimental period (fig. 5A). The measured tumor volumes were statistically different between the tumor control group and mice treated with Dox5(P &lt; 0.0001), Dox5+ dLGG5 (P0.0015) or dLGG25 (P0.0015). Tumor weights were also measured for all treatment groups and compared to tumor control group tumor weights at endpoint (fig. 5B and 5C). dLGG therapy significantly and dose-dependently reduced tumor volume by 18% (dLGG5) and 47% (dLGG25) (P &lt; 0.05) compared to the tumor control group. Tumor weight reduction of 60% and 62% (P &lt; 0.05) was observed in the test animals treated with Dox5 and Dox5+ dLGG5, respectively. CR-API200 and CR-API400 therapies were observed to reduce tumor weight by 12% (P-0.1526) and 24% (P-0.0528), respectively. Taken together, this result indicates that dLGG ameliorates TNBC tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.</p>CR-API and dLGG therapy reduced Ki-67 expression and increased caspase-3 expression in tumor tissues</p>To demonstrate the effect of CR-API or dLGG therapy on TNBC tumor tissue, IHC staining was performed. Ki67, a marker for cell proliferation, was used to see if the extract of the invention had a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation (fig. 6A). Ki-67 was observed to be overexpressed in the tumor control group, which represents rapidly growing and proliferating cells. This phenomenon was reduced regardless of the dose of CR-API or dLGG used. Similar effects were observed in animals treated with Dox5 and Dox5+ dLGG 5. This result suggests that dLGG inhibits tumor cell proliferation and may effectively block tumor growth of TNBC.</p>The effect of compound therapy on apoptosis of tumor tissue cells was tested using the expression level of lytic caspase-3, an apoptosis marker (fig. 6B). All treatment groups showed increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 compared to vehicle control group. Notably, caspase-3 expression was higher in the Dox5, CR-API400, and dLGG25 treatment groups than in the low dose therapy and Dox5+ dLGG5 combination therapy. This result indicates that CR-API or dLGG therapy induces TNBC tumorigenic apoptosis, similar to the apoptotic effect of doxorubicin therapy. This result is an important indicator of CR-API or dLGG as a tumor growth inhibitor.</p>CR-API and dLGG treatment inhibit tumor metastasis to lung and liver remotely</p>In the tumor control group, spontaneous tumor lung and liver metastases were detected. Therefore, Ki-67 in both organs was stained with H &amp; E and IHC to determine the presence of hyperproliferative or metastatic cancer cells at this distant organ translocation site in tumor control mice and compound-treated mice. As seen in fig. 7 and 8, there were fewer tumor metastasis nodules in lung and liver tissue of mice treated with Dox5, Dox5+ dLGG5, dLGG5 and dLGG25, or CR-API200 and CR-API400 compared to tumor control groups. This result indicates that dLGG or CR-API treatment inhibits TNBC tumor metastasis and is similar to the effect of doxorubicin.</p>CR-API and dLGG therapy inhibits tumor-or doxorubicin-induced pulmonary and hepatic inflammation</p>An overall increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory COX-2 in tumor tissue and liver and lung organs indicates increased inflammation, which may exacerbate tumor growth and metastasis or serve as an indicator of other potential side effects (Minn JA, Gupta GP, Siegel PM et al, (2005) Genes at medium breakdown metastasis measurements to lung 436(7050): 518-. The COX-2 protein expression levels in the liver (FIG. 9A) and lung (FIG. 9B) tissues of the test animals were compared. COX-2 expression in organs of animals in the dLGG or CR-API treated groups decreased in a drug dose-dependent manner and was similar to the expression levels in sham-treated controls. On the other hand, it was observed that Dox5 treatment further induced COX-2 expression in this organ. Interestingly, COX-2 expression was reduced in the Dox5+ dLGG5 c"
