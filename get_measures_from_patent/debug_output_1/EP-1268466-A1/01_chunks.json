A resulting compound of formula V may be converted into another compound of formula V e.g. as described in Example 1, step h). \n\nThe starting compounds of formulae IN, VI and Nil are known or may be produced in analogous manner to known compounds.</p>\n  Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro using somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibiting factor, SRTJF) receptor expressing cell cultures and in animals, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.</p>\n  In particular the agents of the invention show high affinity to somatostatin receptors. More particularly they are selective antagonists at Somatostatin sst<sub>3</sub> receptors, previously called SSTR-3 receptors (see Hoyer et al., TiPS, 1995, 16; 86-88), as determined in radioligand binding and second messenger studies [see for example K. Kaupmann et al., FEBS LETTERS 1993, 331: 53-59, S. Siehler et al. \u039daunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol, 1999, 360: 488-499] where they exhibit selective affinity for sst<sub>3</sub> receptors with pKd values between about 7.5 and 9.0.</p>\n  The agents of the invention are therefore useful for treatment in anxiety, depression, social phobia, panic disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, ADHD (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders), bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, including negative symptoms, neurodegenerative diseases such as learning/memory disorders, dementia, age associated memory impairment, SDAT, for the treatment of tumours and for vascular disorders and immunological diseases, as confirmed in a range of standard tests as indicated below:</p>\n  At doses of about 0.3 to 3 mg/kg p.o., the agents of the invention increase exploratory behaviour of mice in the open half of the half enclosed platform, a model which is predictable for anxiolytic activity (Psychopharmacology, 1986, 89:31-37).</p>\n  In the same half enclosed platform model, the agents of the invention at the above indicated doses also increase vigilance of the mice. The compounds are therefore indicated for the treatment of depression, schizophrenia and dementia, in particular of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). \n\nIn the intruder mouse test [Triangle, 1982, 21: 95-105; J. Clin. Psychiatry, 1994, 55:9 (suppl. B) 4- 7], the agents of the invention increase social investigation and reduce defensive ambivalence in the treated intruder mouse at doses of about 1 to about 10 mg/kg s.c, suggesting an antimanic profile like carbamazepine and lithium, a neuroleptic profile like clozapine a",
    "ered over Hyflo, the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure and the remaining aqueous phase twice extracted with EtOAc (150 ml, 50 ml). Drying over Na<sub>2</sub>SO and evaporation give the diamino intermediate as a brownish, clear oil which tends to darken upon exposure to light and air. This intermediate is dissolved in absolute EtOH (60 ml) and cooled to 0\u00b0. l,4-dioxane-2,3-diol (3.75 g, 31.2 mmol) is added at once and the solution stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture is evaporated to dryness, the residue distributed between brine (50 ml) and DCM (50 ml), the organic phase washed with brine (25 ml), dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO and evaporated to afford (S)-2-methyl-3- quinoxalin-6-yl-propan-l-ol as a brownish, clear, viscous oil of sufficient purity for the next step, ee = 91% (HPLC on chiral stat. phase).

After 5 minutes stirring at 0\u00b0, the two phase mixture is filtered over Hyflo, the phases separated, the organic phase washed with a solution of 116 mg KI in 15 ml 1 N HCl, then 15 ml of a 5% Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> solution and finally 15 ml brine. Drying over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporation afford crude aldehyde. MPLC purification (silicagel, EtOAc/hexane 2:1) yield pure (S)-2-Methyl-3-quinoxalin-6-yl-propionaldehyde as a slightly yellow clear oil.

NaBH(OAc)<sub>3</sub> (3.56 g, 16.8 mmol) is added and the mixture stirred for 1 h. A 1 M solution of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (100 ml) is added and intensively stirred for 15 minutes. The phases are separated, the organic phase dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO and evaporated to afford 7.2 g of the crude product. MPLC purification (silicagel, EtOAc, then EtOAc MeOH 5:1) yield pure [4-(3,4-Difluoro-phenyl)- piperazin-l-yl]-[(4S,4aS,8aR)-2-(2(S)-methyl-3-quinoxalin-6-yl-propyl)-decahydro-isoquinolin- 4-yl]-methanone. This base is dissolved in 60 ml warm MeOH and treated with maleic acid (1.3 g, 11.22 mmol) in 20 ml MeOH. The solution is diluted with Et<sub>2</sub>O (450 ml), and the slightly cloudy solution filtered"
