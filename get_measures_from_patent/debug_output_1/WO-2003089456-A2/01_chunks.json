    " test compound. Alternatively, test compounds that modulate the activity of a PKC isozyme can be determined with an assay and then tested for a corresponding therapeutic activity.</p>For example, a competitive binding screening assay can be used to identify compounds that mimic the activity of a PKC isozyme by adding a test compound and a detectably labeled peptide of the invention to mammalian cells, tissue, or the suitable RACK under conditions that allow binding of the peptide and comparing the results against binding of the labeled peptide (without test compound) to the cell, tissue or RACK. Compounds that mimic the activity of the peptide can compete with the peptide for binding to the cell, tissue or RACK. Consequently, a smaller amount of RACK-bound labeled peptide (or a larger amount of RACK-unbound labeled peptide) will be measured when the test compound mimics the activity of the peptide by binding to the receptor (as compared to the amounts of free and RACK-bound labeled peptide when a test compound does not mimic the activity of the peptide, does not bind to the receptor, or does so with less affinity).</p>In general, identification of compounds that mimic the activity of PKC isozymes are identified by measuring the ability of a test compound to inhibit, enhance, or modulate the activity of the corresponding PKC isozyme. The activity of the PKC isozyme in a selected assay is measured in the presence and absence of the test compound. The assay can be a competitive binding assay (e.g., as described above) or a cellular assay the monitors modulation of a second messenger \n\nproduction, changes in cellular metabolism, or effects on enzymatic activity. Compounds identified as mimicking or modulating the activity of the PKC isozyme are then tested for therapeutic activity using a corresponding in vivo disease model.</p>TESTING</p>Activity of the peptides of the invention can be determined using any of the established in vitro and in vivo assays of efficacy in treatment of the above- mentioned indications. Ultimately, of course, safety and efficacy are determined in controlled human clinical studies. Representative testing protocols are summarized below in the context of determining activity for the treatment of pain, and for the treatment of ischemia. Testing protocols for other PKC V5 peptide indications will be well known to those skilled in the art.</p>V5 Domain Activity as Illustrated by PKC Peptides for Pain Management</p>The effect of a PKC peptide to modulate nociception is investigated using models of acute inflammatory pain induced by capsaicin or by formalin. These models, and others, having long-term increases of sensitivity to noxious stimuli can be useful in modeling certain human pathological pain. The capsaicin model of inflammation, together with a low rate thermal test, mimics central sensitization and hyperalgesia resulting from chronic pain. Application of capsaicin to the skin produces a robust, hours-long, C fiber select"
