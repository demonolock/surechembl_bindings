    "l, Nat. Biotechnol. 14:1021-1025 (1996)). Briefly, biotin was appended to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA by standard transcription protocols using 4-fold molar excess of 5\u2032-biotin GMP over GTP in the reaction mixture. Immulon 2 wells were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with gpIIb/IIIa. The wells were washed and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Two-fold serial dilutions of RNA from 1 \u03bcM to 980 \u03c1M were performed and the RNA was incubated in the protein-coated well at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 min. Unbound RNA was removed by washing. To detect bound RNA, 1:1000 streptavidin-alkaline phosphate conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) was incubated in the wells for 30 min at room temp. Finally p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) was used as a substrate and, after addition, absorbance at 405 nm was measured every 30 sec over 30 min in a EL311 Microplate Autoreader (Bio-tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, Vt.). Binding data is fit to an equation that describes the fraction of RNA bound as a function of K<sub>d </sub>for monophasic binding behavior.</p>Competition Assay</p>The assay was carried out as above with the exception that after addition of 5\u2032-biotinylated RNA, either a) buffer, b) cold (unlabeled with <sup>32</sup>P) gpIIb/IIIa RNA, c) Abciximab (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.) or d) Eptifibatide (COR Therapeutics Inc, San Fran Francisco, Calif.) was added at two-fold serial dilutions between 100 to 0.1-fold excess of the compound's dissociation constant.</p>Functional Assays</p>Platelet Function Analysis (PFA). Platelet Function Analyzer, PFA-100 (Dade Behring, Deerfield, Ill.) provides a quantitative measure of platelet function in anti-coagulated whole blood (Ortel et al, Thromb. Haemost. 84:93-97 (2000)). Briefly, 800 \u03bcL of whole blood was mixed with aptamers in a platelet binding buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl; 20 mM HEPES pH: 7.4; 5 mM KCl; 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The maximum closing time of the PFA-100 is 300 seconds. Antidote activity of aptamer was measured by mixing whole blood with aptamer in buffer followed by administration of antidote and measuring in PFA.</p>Platelet Aggregometry. Chrono-log Whole Blood Lumi Ionized Aggregometer (Chrono-log, Haverton, Pa.) provided a measurement of platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Briefly, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was isolated from whole blood and 450 \u03bcl of PRP, 50 \u03bcl of aptamer and 50 \u03bcl Chono-lume were added. After calibrating the instrument, 5 \u03bcl of ADP agonist was added and transmission was measured for 6 minutes.</p>Results</p>A solid phase platform of SELEX was utilized whereby the protein was adsorbed to plates and the presence and integrity of the protein was verified by ELISA. In this assay, two antibodies were used, CD41, which recognized the gpIIb/IIIa complex, and CD61, which recognizes the \u03b2<sub>3 </sub>subunit of the heterodimer. Ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), a calcium chelator, was used to de",
    "40 nucleotide-randomized region that bind to VWF with high affinity and specificity. Employing the SELEX procedure yielded aptamers rapidly and made it possible to assess the inhibitory function in in vitro experiments. Previously, nuclease-resistant aptamers have been isolated that bind to and inhibit human factors Vila, IXa, Xa and IIa using \u201cSELEX\u201d. As with numerous selection experiments previously conducted, nitrocellulose-filter binding was employed as the partitioning scheme. Briefly, <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled RNA aptamers (&lt;0.1 nM) were incubated with the individual protein at a range of concentrations. The RNA-protein complexes were separated from the free RNA by passing the mixture through a nitrocellulose filter by vacuum. Bound and free RNA were quantified by phosphorimager analysis and the data fitted to yield the K<sub>d</sub>s for the RNA aptamer-protein interaction. A decreasing K<sub>d </sub>value pointed to increasing affinity of RNA molecules for VWF. The RNA round that yielded a binding affinity in low nanomolar range is sequenced and individual clones are grouped into families based on their sequence similarity and structural conservation using computer-aided secondary structure analysis.</p>VWF \u201cSELEX\u201d: Using the starting library, 9 rounds of selection were performed to purified human VWF protein (obtained from Haemtech Inc.). There was a steady increase in binding affinity to VWF from the starting library to R9 (VWF selection round 9) (FIG. 6.). The Kd of round 9 reached the single digit nanomolar range, thus the individual clones making up the R9RNA pool were cloned and characterized.

As noted above, aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acid molecules that can directly inhibit protein function by binding to their targets with high affinity and specificity (Nimjee, Rusconi et al, Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 15:41-45 (2005)). To isolate RNA aptamers against VWF, a modified version of SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment), termed \u201cconvergent\u201d SELEX, was performed. These aptamers bind to VWF with high affinity (K<sub>d</sub>&lt;20 nM) and inhibit platelet aggregation in Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) and ristocetin induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) assays. Moreover, an antidote molecule that can quickly reverse such aptamers' function has been nationally designed. This antidote molecule can give physicians better control in clinics, enh",
    "rocellulose filter (BA 85, Whatman Inc, NJ).</p>Five rounds of SELEX were performed on the plasma proteome followed by four rounds of convergent SELEX as described by Layzer et al. (oligonucleotides 17:XX-XX (2007)). Briefly, the starting aptamer library (Sel2) was incubated with diluted normal human plasma at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes in selection buffer E. Yeast tRNA was used to inhibit non-specific binding of the aptamer library to the plasma proteome. Bound RNA aptamers were separated from unbound aptamers using a nitrocellulose filter. Following round 5 of plasma SELEX, convergent SELEX using VWF was performed for 4 rounds (2 rounds in selection buffer E followed by 2 rounds in selection buffer F).</p>Antidote Oligonucleotides</p>Antidote oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research, Inc. 2\u2032-O-methyl purines and pyrimidines were incorporated into the antidote oligonucleotides.</p>Binding Assays</p>Affinity constants (K<sub>d </sub>values) were determined using double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assays (Rusconi et al, Thromb. Haemost. 84:841-848 (2000)). All binding studies were performed in either binding buffer E (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% BSA) or binding buffer F (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% BSA) at 37\u00b0 C. Human purified VWF (factor VIII free) was purchased from Haematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT) and used in the double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assay to determine the K<sub>d </sub>of every other round and individual clones. VWF SPI and VWF SPIII domains were kindly provided by Dr. J. Evan Sadler (Washington University in St. Louis). Briefly, RNA were dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Gibco BRL, Gaithberg, Md.) and end-labeled at the 5\u2032 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and [\u03b3<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.) (Fitzwater and Polisky, Methods Enzymol. 267:275-301 (1996)). Direct binding was performed by incubating <sup>32</sup>P-RNA with VWF in physiological buffer+1 mg/ml BSA at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 min. The fraction of the nucleic acid-protein complex which bound to the nitrocellulose membrane was quantified with a posphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Non-specific binding of the radiolabeled nucleic acid was subtracted out of the binding such that only specific binding remained (Wong and Lohman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5428-5432 (1993)).</p>Platelet Function Analysis</p>PFA-100</p>The Platelet Function Analyzer, PFA-100 (Dade Behring, Deerfield, Ill.), measures platelet function in terms of clot formation time. In this assay, collagen/ADP cartridges were utilized to activate the platelets and measure the amount of time taken to form a clot in anticoagulated whole blood (Harrison, Blood Rev. 19:111-123 (2005)). Briefly, 840 \u03bcL of whole blood was mixed with aptamer in platelet binding buffer (150 mM NaCl; ",
    " because it binds specifically to VWF in platelet rich plasma (PRP) and assists in VWF-mediated platelet activation/aggregation through the GP Ib-IX-V receptor. Other antagonists (collagen, ADP and thrombin) that activate platelets through pathways that are not dependent on the VWF-GP Ib-IX-V interaction were also evaluated to determine if the aptamers had any inhibitory effect on these additional activation pathways. As shown in FIG. 10C, VWF aptamers R9.3 and R9.14 completely inhibited RIPA (at a concentration of 250 nM), illustrating that the aptamers can potently inhibit the VWF-GP Ib-IX-V interaction. In contrast, the aptamers had no effect in collagen, ADP or thrombin induced platelet aggregation (FIG. 10C). Thus, VWF aptamers R9.3 and R9.14 inhibit platelet function by specifically blocking VWF-GP Ib-IX-V-mediated platelet activation and aggregation.</p>Antidote Oligonucleotide 6 (AO6) can Reverse VWF R9.14 Binding to VWF to Background Levels.</p>Six different antidote oligonucleotides (AO1-6) were designed to bind to VWF aptamer R9.14 through Watson-Crick base pairing rules (FIG. 11A). This strategy has been successfully employed to design an antidote to control the activity of an aptamer to factor IXa (Rusconi et al, Nature 419:90-94 (2002), Rusconi et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 22:1423-1428 (2004), Nimjee et al, Mol. Ther. 14:408-415 (2006)). To determine if the antidote oligonucleotides could inhibit aptamer binding to VWF, they were evaluated in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. As shown in FIG. 11B, the most effective antidote for VWF aptamer. R9.14 is AO6. This antidote can reverse VWF aptamer R9.14's ability to bind VWF to background levels (FIG. 11B).</p>AO6 Can Reverse the Effects of VWF R9.14 Completely in a PFA-100 Assay.</p>Since AO6 can reverse VWF aptamer 9.14 binding to VWF, it was next determined whether the antidote could also reverse the aptamer's activity in a whole blood clinical lab assay was tested. To that end, the ability of AO6 to inhibit VWF aptamer 9.14 was tested in a PFA-100 assay. As shown in FIG. 12A, the antidote can reverse the activity of the aptamer in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, the antidote is able to completely reverse the antiplatelet effects of the VWF aptamer R9.14 at a 40-fold excess of aptamer concentration. In contrast, a scrambled version of the antidote oligonucleotide (Scr AO6) had no effect on aptamer activity (FIG. 12A). Thus, antidote AO6 is able to restore platelet function in a whole blood assay back to normal levels, even in the presence of enough VWF aptamer 9.14 (40 nM) to impede platelet function to an extent consistent with VWD.</p>AO6 Can Quickly Reverse the Effects of VWF R9.14 for a Sustained Period of Time in a PFA-100 Assay.</p>For such an antidote to be useful clinically, the antidote should be able to act quickly and for a prolonged period of time. To determine how rapidly AO6 could reverse the aptamer and how long such reversal is sustained, a time course assay was per",
    "-123 (2005)). Both clone R9.3 and R9.14 completely inhibited platelet plug formation in PFA-100 at concentrations&gt;40 nM (closing time&gt;300s). Moreover, these aptamers were tested in ristocetin, ADP, thrombin (SFLLRN peptide) and collagen mediated platelet aggregation assays for pathway specificity. Both of these clones inhibited RIPA at &gt;250 nM concentration but had no significant effect in other agonist mediated aggregation assays. These experiments show that both clone R9.3 and clone R9.14 bind VWF with high affinity and inhibit platelet aggregation through inhibition of GP Ib-IX-V-VWF interaction. This interaction is especially important around areas of high shear stress (i.e., stenosed arteries) and is a valid target for antiplatelet therapy.</p>Antidote control gives physicians added control over drug activity and provides a safer means for antiplatelet therapy. To further improve the safety of the lead molecule R9.14, an antidote oligonucleotide was rationally designed using the properties inherent to nucleic acids (Rusconi et al, Nature 419:90-94 (2002), Rusconi et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 22:1423-1428 (2004), Nimjee et al, Mol. Ther. 14:408-415 (2006)). Antidote oligonucleotides bind to their target aptamer through Watson-Crick base pairing, thus changing the aptamer's conformational shape and inhibiting binding to its target, therefore reversing its activity. Six different antidote oligonucleotides were designed and their activity tested in nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Antidote oligonucleotide 6 (AO6) was the most effective in inhibiting aptamer binding to VWF, completely reducing it to nonspecific, background levels. To test the effect of antidote AO6 on clone R9.14, the pair was tested in PFA-100. AO6 completely reverses the antiplatelet effect of R9.14 in less than 2 minutes and is effective for at least 4 hours. This aptamer-antidote pair can potentially give physicians a rapid, effective and continual way to regulate antiplatelet therapy.</p>EXAMPLE 4Experimental Details</p>Synthesis of Aptamer Truncates and Antidote Oligonucleotides</p>The antidote oligonucleotides and primers used in the truncation of the aptamer were synthesized and purified by IDT Inc (Coralville, Ind.). Software predicting RNA secondary structure (Mfold by M. Zuker) was used to aid in the design of truncates. Briefly, primers were designed to make progressively shorter DNA templates for aptamer molecules. T7 RNA polymerase was then used to transcribe RNA aptamers and tested each of these in binding assays.</p>Binding Assay</p>Dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of each truncate were determined using double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assays (Pergolizzi et al, Blood 108:862-869 (2006)). All binding studies were performed in binding buffer F (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% BSA) at 37\u00b0 C. Human purified VWF (with factor VIII and factor VIII free) was purchased from Haematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT) and used in the double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assay to determine the K<sub>d </sub>of individual clones. Briefly, RNA was dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Gibco BRL, Gaithberg, Md.) and end-labeled at the 5\u2032 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and [\u03b3<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). Direct binding was performed by incubating <sup>32</sup>P\u2014RNA with VWF in physiological buffer+1 mg/ml BSA at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 min. The fraction of the nucleic acid-protein complex which bound to the nitrocellulose membrane was quantified with a phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.).</p>Non-specific binding of the radiolabeled nucleic acid was subtracted out of the binding such that only specific binding remained (Wong and Lohman, Proc.

It is highly sensitive to VWF levels. Briefly, whole blood (840 \u03bcl) was mixed with VWF aptamer in phosphate-buffered saline with magnesium and calcium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. This mixture was then added to a collagen/ADP cartridge and tested for its closing time. The cartridge contains a microscopic aperture cut into a biologically active membrane at the end of a c",
    "he mice were injected with saline or 10-fold molar excess of antidote oligonucleotide 1 (AO1). After 2 minutes, 2 mm of the distal tail was amputated and blood was collected for 15 minutes in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline at 37\u00b0 C. Blood loss was determined by measuring the absorbance of saline at 550 nm and comparing the result to a standard curve constructed from known volumes of mouse blood as previously described (Fay et al, Blood 93:1825-1830 (1999)).</p>Data Analysis</p>All data is expressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation. All data was inputted into Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, Calif.). All statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism or Graphpad Instat (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, Calif.).</p>Results</p>The VWF Aptamer Inhibits Thrombosis In Vivo</p>Previously described aptamer termed 9.14 (Table 4) binds and inhibits human VWF binding to human GP Ib-IX-V and prevents human platelet aggregation in vitro (Oney et al, Oligonucleotides 17:265-274 (2007)). To evaluate the ability of this aptamer to inhibit platelet function in animals, an attempt was first made to truncate and modify aptamer 9.14 to facilitate large scale synthesis of the oligonucleotide. Truncated versions of the aptamer were created and tested based on progressive deletion of nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the molecule (Table 4). It was determined that aptamer 9.14 could be truncated from 80 nucleotides to 60 nucleotides without significantly reducing its ability to bind VWF (dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 44 nM compared to 12 nM for the full length aptamer) (Oney et al, Oligonucleotides 17:265-274 (2007)) (FIG. 13A). Moreover, this truncated aptamer termed 9.14-T10 also retained its ability to inhibit platelet function as measured in a Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) assay (FIG. 13B). Truncate 9.14-T10 also tolerated a cholesterol modification to the 5\u2032-end of the aptamer (termed Ch-9.14-T10) to increase its circulating half-life in vivo (Rusconi et al, Nature Biotechnology 22:1423-1428 (2004)) without altering its ability to completely inhibit platelet aggregation (FIG. 13B).</p>TABLE\u20034Sequences\u2003and\u2003binding\u2003properties\u2003of\u2003VWF\u2003aptamer\u2003truncatesLengthBmaxAptamer(nt)Binding(%)Sequence9.148070GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACGACTCGCTGAGGATCCGAGA 9.14\u2003T177Similar72GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACGACTCGCTGAGGATCCG 9.14\u2003T272Decreased50GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACGACTCGCTGAGG 9.14\u2003T369Decreased50GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACGACTCGCTG 9.14\u2003T451No\u2003transcriptionGGGAGGCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACGACTCGCTGAGG 9.14\u2003T566Decreased28GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGcrGACGCACAGACGACTCG 9.14\u2003T663Decreased36GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGACAGC 9.14\u2003T759Decreased22GGGAGGACGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGCACAGA 9.14\u2003T866Similar67GGGAGGATGCGGTGGACGAACTGCCCTCAGCTACTTTCATGTTGCTGACGC"
