{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nBovine factor X is one of the highest affinity proteins in this family, giving a Kd for PS/PC (20/80) at 2 mM calcium of 40 nM.\nThe Kd for bovine factor X, obtained from the result at a protein/phospholipid ratio of 0.55 (FIG. 1), was 0.025 \u03bcM.\nUsing these assumptions and the data at a protein to phospholipid ratio of 0.37, Kd values were 0.7 \u03bcM for bovine factor X, 5.5 \u03bcM for wild type factor VII and 0.23 \u03bcM for VIIQ11E33."}
