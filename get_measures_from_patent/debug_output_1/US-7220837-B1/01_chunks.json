    "holipid vesicles alone (I<sub>1</sub>) and after addition of protein (I<sub>2</sub>) were measured and corrected for background from buffer and unbound protein. The molecular weight ratio of the protein-vesicle complex (M<sub>2</sub>) to that of the vesicles alone (M1), can be estimated from the relationship in equation 1, where \u03b4n/\u03b4c is the refractive index of the respective species.\n\nI<sub>2</sub>/I<sub>1</sub>=(M<sub>2</sub>/M<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(\u03b4n/\u03b4c<sub>2</sub>/\u03b4n/\u03b4c<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>\u2003\u2003(eq. 1)\n</p>If phospholipid and protein concentrations are known, the concentration of bound [P*PL] and free protein [P] can be estimated. These values, together with the maximum protein binding capacity [P*PL<sub>max</sub>] of the vesicles (assumed to be 1.0 g/g for all proteins) can be used to obtain the equilibrium constant for protein-membrane interaction by the relationship in equation 2, where all concentrations are expressed as molar protein or protein binding sites.\n\nK<sub>D</sub>=[P][P*PL<sub>max</sub>\u2212P*PL]/[P*PL]\u2003\u2003(eq. 2)\n</p>Binding was assessed at 5 mM calcium and is expressed as the ratio, M2/M1.</p>FIG. 1 shows the binding of wild type VIIa (open circles) and factor VIIQ11E33 (filled circles) to membranes of either PS/PC=25/75, 25 \u03bcg/ml (FIG. 1A) or PS/PC=10/90, 25 \u03bcg/ml (FIG. 1B). VIIQ11E33 had much higher affinity than wild type protein. Binding to PS/PC (25/75) was at the quantitative level so that [Protein<sub>free</sub>] was essentially zero. Consequently, Kd values could not be estimated from this data. Membrane binding of bovine factor X (filled triangles) is shown in FIG. 1 as a reference. Bovine factor X is one of the highest affinity proteins in this family, giving a Kd for PS/PC (20/80) at 2 mM calcium of 40 nM. McDonald et al., 1997, Biochemistry, 36:5120\u20135127. The Kd for bovine factor X, obtained from the result at a protein/phospholipid ratio of 0.55 (FIG. 1), was 0.025 \u03bcM.</p>Binding of wild-type and mutant Factor VII to membranes of PS/PC (10/90) was also determined (FIG. 1B). The VIIQ11E33 bound at less than the quantitative level, which allowed a binding constant to be estimated from the relationship in equation 3.\n\nKd=[Protein<sub>free</sub>][Binding sites<sub>free</sub>]/[Protein<sub>bound</sub>]\u2003\u2003(eq. 3)\n</p>[Binding sites<sub>free</sub>] were estimated from equation 4, assuming a maximum M2/M1 of 1.0 (i.e., [Binding sites<sub>total</sub>]=[Phospholipid<sub>weight conc.</sub>/Protein<sub>MW</sub>]). This is a common value observed for several proteins of this family. See McDonald et al., 1997, supra.\n\n[Binding sites<sub>free</sub>]=[Binding sites<sub>total</sub>]\u2212[Protein<sub>bound</sub>]\u2003\u2003(eq. 4)\n</p>Using these assumptions and the data at a protein to phospholipid ratio of 0.37, Kd values were 0.7 \u03bcM for bovine factor X, 5.5 \u03bcM for wild type factor VII and 0.23 \u03bcM for VIIQ11E33. Thus, it was clear that factor VIIQ11E33 was greatly improved in membrane binding affinity over wild type factor VII and had one of the highest membrane-binding affinities among the vitamin K-dependent proteins.</p>It also has been observed that the difference between wild-type VIIa and VIIa-Q11E33 varied somewhat with the composition of the phospholipid vesicles that were used. For example, membranes containing PS/PE/PC (20/40/40) produced a 33-fold higher activity for VIIQ11E33, while certain preparations of PS/PC (20/80 to 25/75) showed a 10 to 19 fold higher activity for VIIQ11E33.</p>Enhanced activation of factor VIIQ11E33: The first step in coagulation involves the activation of factor VII. Autoactivation of VII was conducted in a solution containing 100 nM sTF (highly purified recombinant product from Dr. Walter Kisiel, Fiore et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269:143\u2013149), 36 nM VIIQ11E33 and PS/PC (25/75, 22 \u03bcg/mL). Activity of VIIaQ11E33 was estimated at various time intervals by addition of 0.15 mm substrate S-2288 (Kabi) and assessing the rate of p-nitrophenylphosphate product release by absorbance change at 405 nm. Initial activity of the VIIQ11E33 preparation was less than 4% that of fully active VIIaQ11E33.</p>VIIQ11E33 was found to be a much better substrate for activation than wild-type factor VII. FIG. 2 shows autoactivation of factor VIIQ11E33. The data were ana"
