Exemplary compounds (Ie) include compounds Ie-1 through Ie-4, whose structures are depicted in FIG. 10.</p>Compounds (I) can be conjugated or linked to another nucleic acid binding compound. The conjugated nucleic acid binding compounds can be two identical or different compounds (I), or one compound (I) and a different class of nucleic acid binder, for example an intercalator, a triple helix former, a binder to the phosphate backbone, a major groove binder, another type of minor groove binder, and the like. A preferred site for forming the conjugating link is an amino, hydroxy, or thiol functionality in a group L in moiety M<sup>2</sup>, which can be acylated or alkylated. The preparation of tandem linked nucleic acid binding polyamides in this manner is disclosed in Baird et al., WO 98/45284 (1998), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>Compounds (I) also can be conjugated to other moieties, such as, peptides, proteins, transport agents, fluorophores or other reporter groups, and the like.</p>Compounds (I) preferably bind to dsDNA with high affinity, meaning an equilibrium dissociation constant of 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>M or less, more preferably 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or less, and most preferably 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less. The measurement of binding affinities by quantitative DNase I footprinting is disclosed in Dervan, WO 98/50582 (1998), and Trauger et al., Nature 382, 559 (8 Aug. 1996); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, and is also described in the examples hereinbelow.</p>Compounds of this invention can be used to form complexes with dsDNA, for the purpose of recognizing and/or isolating dsDNA strands containing particular base-pair sequences, for example for analytical or diagnostic purposes. Thus, in another aspect of this invention there is provided a complex between dsDNA and compound of this invention. In cellular systems or in living organisms, they can modulate the expression of a gene by binding to the gene or a promoter or repressor region thereof. Such modulation may be useful for therapeutic or research purposes.</p>Additionally, compounds of this invention have been found to have anti-bacterial and/or properties and therefore may be used for combating (i.e., preventing and/or treating) infections in eukaryotic organisms, especially mammals. Other pathogens against which compounds of this invention can be useful include fungi, protozoa and viruses. For human anti-infective applications, an effective amount of a compound of this invention is used, optionally in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carri"
