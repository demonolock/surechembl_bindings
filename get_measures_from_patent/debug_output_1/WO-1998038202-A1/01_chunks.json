    "W, W, R and Z are the same as defined above for IV. It is understood that in the above Formulae IV and IVA the designation of \"(N' or Z)\" indicates that one of N' and Z is present at the P-ester position.</p>Also preferred compounds of Formula I are the following compounds of Formula V:</p><img id=\"imgf000010_0001\" path=\"imgf000010_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168136937/WO/19980903/A1/001998/03/82/02/imgf000010_0001.tif\"/></p>wherein Z, W, W X, Y, R, N and m are the same as defined for Formula I.</p>Again, generally preferred compounds of Formula V include conjugates of phosphonoformic acid derivatives, i.e. compounds of the following Formula VA:</p><img id=\"imgf000010_0002\" path=\"imgf000010_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168136938/WO/19980903/A1/001998/03/82/02/imgf000010_0002.tif\"/></p>wherein Z, W, W, R, and N are the same as defined for Formula I. As mentioned above, therapeutic compounds of the invention (i.e. compounds of Formulae I, IA, II, IIA, III, IIIA, IV, WA, V and VA) are useful for treatment of viral infections, especially retroviral infections and in particular HIV infections, including treatment against HIV strains that exhibit resistance to current therapies. Compounds of the invention have been found to inhibit HIV- 1 replication in cells infected with AZT-resistant H\u0393V- 1 strains as well as cells infected with PFA-resistant HTV-1 strains. Particularly preferred compounds of the invention exhibit EC50 values of about 10 \u03bcM or less, and more preferably about 1 \u03bcM or less against AZT resistant HIV-1 strains (such as A018-post) and/ or Foscamet resistant HTV- 1 strains (such as LAI-E89K) in standard HIV plaque reduction assays, specifically the HIV Plaque Reduction Assay of the protocol specified in \n\nExample 27 which follows. References herein to \"HIV Plaque Reduction Assay\" are intended to refer to the protocol of that Example 27.</p>The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise one or more compounds of the invention and a suitable carrier. In a particularly preferred aspect, compounds of the invention are formulated as liposomes. The invention also provides compounds useful to prepare compounds of the invention. Other aspects of the invention are disclosed infra. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>We have now discovered that compounds of the following Formulae I, II, III, IV and V can be used to treat viral infections, particularly virally infected human cells, including cells infected with a retrovirus such as HIV, and thus the compounds can be used for treatment of HIV infected individuals:</p>W W</p>(R, N or Z)O - C - (CXY) <sub>m</sub> - P - O(R\", N\" or Z\")</p>OCR'.
