{"raw_mentions": "Compounds of the invention have been found to inhibit HIV- 1 replication in cells infected with AZT-resistant H\u0393V- 1 strains as well as cells infected with PFA-resistant HTV-1 strains. \nParticularly preferred compounds of the invention exhibit EC50 values of about 10 \u03bcM or less, and more preferably about 1 \u03bcM or less against AZT resistant HIV-1 strains (such as A018-post) and/ or Foscamet resistant HTV- 1 strains (such as LAI-E89K) in standard HIV plaque reduction assays."}
