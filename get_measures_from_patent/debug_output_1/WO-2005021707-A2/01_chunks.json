    "Outbreak news: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Wkly. Epidemiol Rec, 2003: 81- 88 (2003). The median duration of symptoms in a small epidemiologic study was 25.5 days. Tsang, K.W., et al. A cluster of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, N. Engl. J. Med. (2003). The severity of illness can range widely from a mild illness to acute respiratory failure resulting in death. Patients with a significant co-morbidity, such as diabetes, or who are older, are more likely to suffer from a severe form of the disease. Questions remain as to why some patients become infected, while others who have intimate contact with infected individuals are spared. It does appear that patients are very contagious at the onset of symptoms. Studies from hospitals in Hong Kong and Hanoi have shown attack rates &gt;56% among healthcare workers caring for SARS patients. It is unclear at this time whether individuals are contagious during the incubation phase.</p>\n  Important Features of Coronaviruses Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses, and they are known to elicit coincident diseases in animals and humans. Mature human coronavirus (HCoV) virions are approximately 100 nm- diameter enveloped particles exposing prominent spike (S), hemagglutinin- esterase (HE) (in some types of coronaviruses), envelope (E) and membrane (M) glycoproteins. Each particle contains an approximately 30 kilobase (kB) RNA genome complexed with an approximately 60 kilodalton (kD) nucleoprotein (N). Fields, B.N. VIROLOGY New York: Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, (Fields, B.N., ed. 2001). All of the above references are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. \n\n[0005] The S proteins of HCoV's have two large domains, the variable SI domain responsible for host cell binding, Breslin, J.J. et al. J. Virol. 11: 4435- 8 (2003), and the S2 domain containing a heptad coiled-coiled structure reminiscent of those involved in fusion in HIV and influenza. Yoo, D.W. et al. Virology 183: 91-8 (1991). The HCoV-229E, group I S protein appears to bind to the human aminopeptidase N glycoprotein, Yeager, C.L., et al. Nature 357: 420-2 (1992); Bonavia, A. et al. J. Virol. 11: 2530-8 (2003), whereas the HCoV-OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43, group II) may bind via sialic acid moieties. Vlasak, R. et al Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85:4526-9 (1988). The genetic variability between strains of coronavirus has not been thoroughly evaluated, although only minor variability has been observed in the S protein in the small number of strains sequenced. Hays, J.P. and Myint, S.H. J. Virol Methods 75: 179-93 (1998); Kunkel, F. and Herrler, G. Arch. Virol. 141: 1123-31 (1996). Most coronaviruses are not only species specific, but also somewhat tissue tropic. This tropism is mostly related to changes in the S protein. Sanchez, CM. et al. J. Virol 73: 7607-18 (1999). Examples of such coronavirus tropism changes are the in vitro demonstration that tropism can be experimentally m",

Data from the FEPV immunization suggests that high levels of potentially neutralizing antibody may be bound by the Fc-mimicking region of the S protein. Scott, F.W. Adv. Vet. Med. 41: 347-58 (1999). Thus, modification or deletion of an Fc\u03b3 region of the SARS-CoV S protein may be useful in the compositions of the present invention.</p>\n  [0054] The nucleocapsid protein (N) is encoded by about nudeotides 28120 through about 29388 of the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV. (Bellini et al. SARS Coronavirus Urbani, complete genome. GenBank Accession No. AY278741). The protein is a phosphoprotein of 50 to 60 kd that interacts with viral genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid. N has three relatively conserved stractural domains, including an RNA-binding domain in the middle that binds to the leader sequence of viral RNA. N protein in the viral nucleocapsid further interacts with the membrane protein (M), leading to the formation of viras particles. N is also suggested to play a role in viral RNA synthesis, by a study in which an antibody directed against N inhibited an in vitro coronaviras RNA polymerase reaction. Marra et al. N protein also binds to cellular membranes and phospholipids, a property that may help to facilitate both viras assembly and formation of RNA replication complexes. \n\n[0055] From about nucelotides 28120 to about 29388 of the Urbani strain of the SARS-CoV genome encode the N protein.
