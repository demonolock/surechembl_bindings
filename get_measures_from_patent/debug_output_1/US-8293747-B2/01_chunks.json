    "EK1, 2 \u03bcM ERK2KR, 2 \u03bcM ATP, 10 \u03bcCi/\u03bcL [\u03b3-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% \u03b2-octylglucoside, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 3% DMSO and test compounds ranging from 20 \u03bcM down to 0.08 nM. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 30 \u03bcL of 1.5% o-phosphoric acid, transferred to Millipore Multiscreen-PH plates and incubated for 5 minutes to allow ERK2KR binding. Non-specific activity was estimated from pre-inactivated reactions wherein 30 \u03bcL of 1.5% o-phosphoric acid was added per well before addition of enzyme. Stopped plates were washed three times by vacuum filtration with 0.75% o-phosphoric acid followed by two washes with 100% ethanol and air dried. 50 \u03bcL of scintillation cocktail was added to each well and <sup>33</sup>P incorporated into ERK2KR was detected using a Wallac Microbeta 1450 JET scintillation counter. Percentage inhibition, IC<sub>50 </sub>and Hill slope values were calculated using ActivityBase software.</p>General Procedure for MEK1 TdF Assays1 \u03bcM protein was mixed with micromolar concentrations (usually 1-50 \u03bcM) of compounds in 20 \u03bcl of assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2% DMSO, Sypro Orange 5\u00d7) in a white 96-well PCR plate. The plate is sealed by clear strips and placed in a thermocycler (Chromo4, BioRad). The fluorescence intensities are monitored at every 0.5\u00b0 C. increment during melting from 25\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C. The data are exported into an excel sheet and subject to a custom curve fitting algorithm to derive TdF Kd values. All TdF Kd values have an error margin of \u02dc50% due to uncertainty with the enthalpy change of binding.</p>In Vitro Aurora TdF AssaysAurora A Assay</p>Aurora A kinase assays were performed in low protein binding 384-well plates (Corning Inc). All reagents were thawed on ice. Test compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO to desirable concentrations. Each reaction consisted of 8 nM enzyme (Aurora A, Upstate cat #14-511), 100 nM Tamra-PKAtide (Molecular Devices, 5TAMRA-GRTGRRNSICOOH), 25 \u03bcM ATP (Roche), 1 mM DTT (Pierce), and kinase buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20). For each reaction, 14 \u03bcl containing TAMRA-PKAtide, ATP, DTT and kianse buffer were combined with 1 \u03bcl diluted compound. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of 5 \u03bcl diluted enzyme. The reaction was allowed to run for 2 hours at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 60 \u03bcl IMAP beads (1:400 beads in progressive (94.7% buffer A: 5.3% buffer B) 1\u00d7 buffer, 24 mM NaCl). After an additional 2 hours, fluorescent polarization was measured using an Analyst AD (Molecular devices).</p>Aurora B Assay</p>Aurora A kinase assays were performed in low protein binding 384-well plates (Corning Inc). All reagents were thawed on ice. Compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO to desirable concentrations. Each reaction consisted of 26 nM enzyme (Aurora B, Invitrogen cat #pv3970), 100 nM Tamra-PKAtide (Molecular Devices, 5TAMRA-GRTGRRNSICOOH), 50 \u03bcM ATP (Roche), 1 mM DTT (Pierce), and kinase buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM M"
