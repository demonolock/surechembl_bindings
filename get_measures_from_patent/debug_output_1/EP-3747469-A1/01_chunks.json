    "d that is effective for achieving the desired therapeutic result.</p>The times the therapeutic agent of the present invention is administered can be appropriately determined according to the condition of the subject receiving the administration, the administration method, and such. The therapeutic agent of the present invention is administered, for example, once to four times a week.</p>Therapeutic agents of the present invention are intended to be administered to humans.</p>Therapeutic agents of the present invention comprise an IL-6 inhibitor as an active ingredient.</p>\"IL-6 inhibitors\" of the present invention are substances that block signal transduction by IL-6, and inhibit the biological activities of IL-6. IL-6 inhibitors are preferably substances that have inhibitory effects against binding to any one of IL-6, IL-6 receptor, and gp130.</p>Examples of an IL-6 inhibitor of the present invention include, but are not particularly limited to, anti-IL-6 antibodies, anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies, anti-gp130 antibodies, IL-6 variants, soluble IL-6 receptor variants, or partial peptides of IL-6 or IL-6 receptor, and low-molecular-weight substances showing a similar activity. Examples of an IL-6 inhibitor of the present invention may be preferably IL-6 receptor-recognizing antibodies.</p> IL-6 transmits its biological activity via two types of proteins on cells. One of them is the IL-6 receptor, which is a ligand-binding protein that has a molecular weight of approximately 80 kD to which IL-6 binds (NPLs 4 and 5). The IL-6 receptor exists as a soluble IL-6 receptor, which is mainly composed of its extracellular region, in addition to a membrane-bound form expressed on the cell membrane and penetrates through the cell membrane.</p>The other one is non-ligand-binding membrane protein gp130, which has a molecular weight of about 130 kDa and is involved in signal transduction. The biological activity of IL-6 is transmitted into a cell through formation of an IL-6/IL-6 receptor complex by IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor, followed by binding of the complex with gp130 (Taga, T. et al, Cell (1989)58, 573-581).</p>IL-6 inhibitors are substances that inhibit the transmission of IL-6 biological activity. So far, antibodies against IL-6 (anti-IL-6 antibodies), antibodies against the IL-6 receptor (anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies), antibodies against gp130 (anti-gp130 antibodies), IL-6 variants, partial peptides of IL-6 or the IL-6 receptor, and such have been known.</p>The origin of the antibodies of the present invention is not particularly limited, but it is preferably a mammal and more preferably human.</p>An anti-IL-6 antibody used in the present invention can be obtained as either a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody using known methods. A monoclonal antibody derived from a mammal is particularly preferred for the anti-IL-6 antibody used in the present invention. The monoclonal antibodies derived from a mammal include those produced by a hybridoma and those prod"
