    "een shown to be disrupted, this could potentially occur due to binding a considerably different epitope and subsequent steric hindrance of APRIL or BAFF docking. The degree of disruption of APRIL- or BAFF-interactions with CD269 caused by the antibodies of the prior has not been documented previously.</p>The antibodies of the present invention enable an effective and reliable disruption, which potentially represents an improved technical effect in comparison to those antibodies described in the art. An in vitro blocking assay can be performed for determination and comparison of BAFF and/or APRIL disruption, for example with the extracellular domain of human BCMA and recombinant BAFF or APRIL.</p>In a preferred embodiment the epitope specificity, in combination with the high affinity shown by the antibodies described herein, represents a novel and unexpected technical effect. In essence, the exceptionally high affinity of J22.9 in combination with the overlap of the BAFF and APRIL binding sites, provides not only \u201cdisruption\u201d or \u201cblocking\u201d of the binding of the natural ligands; but rather the ultra-high affinity of the antibody of the invention ensures that the native ligands are essentially excluded completely or almost completely from binding their BCMA target when the antibody is present.</p>As disclosed in the examples below, the affinity of the antibody as described herein is surprisingly high and comparatively better than similar approaches attempted in the prior art. A Kd in the pM range (as shown below) is commonly accepted as an outstanding affinity not to be expected in common practice.</p>In another aspect the antibody or antibody fragment of the invention binds CD269 with high affinity, for example when measured by surface plasmon resonance, such as Biacore, the antibody binds to human CD269 with an affinity of 20 nM or less or an affinity of 15 nM or less or an affinity of 5 nM or less or an affinity of 1000 pM or less or an affinity of 500 pM or less or an affinity of 100 pM or less, or 800 pM or less or for example about 54 pM. In a further embodiment the antibody binds to human CD269 when measured by surface plasmon resonance, such as Biacore, of between about 1 pM and about 500 pM or between about 10 pM and about 200 pM, or between about 20 pM and about 100 pM. In one embodiment of the present invention the antibody binds CD269 with an affinity of around 50 pM.</p>Preferred Embodiments Regarding Antibody Sequence and StructureIn one embodiment of the invention the isolated antibody or antibody fragment is characterised in that it is a chimeric, humanised, partially humanised, bi-specific or a single chain antibody, or combination thereof.</p>The antibodies disclosed in the examples of the present invention relate primarily to a chimeric or partially humanised antibody, comprising a human constant domains and VH and VL domains with CD269-specificity derived from mouse. The invention relates however to further humanised sequences, e",

Where the term \u201cantibody\u201d is used, the term \u201cantibody fragment\u201d may also be considered to be referred to. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. The basic immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer or dimer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (L) (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d (H) chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids, primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms \u201cvariable light chain\u201d and \u201cvariable heavy chain\u201d refer to these variable regions of the light and heavy chains respectively. Optionally, the antibody or the immunological portion of the antibody, can be chemically conjugated to, or expressed as, a fusion protein with other proteins.</p>The antibodies of the invention are intended to bind against mammalian, in particular human, protein targets. The use of protein names may correspond to either mouse or human versions of a protein.</p>\u201cSpecific binding\u201d is to be understood as via one skilled in the art, whereby the skilled person is clearly aware of various experimental procedures that can be used to test binding and binding specificity. Some cross-reaction or background binding may be inevitable in many protein-protein interactions; this is not to detract from the \u201cspecificity\u201d of the binding between antibody and epitope. The term \u201cdirected against\u201d is also applicable when considering the term \u201cspecificity\u201d in understanding the interaction between antibody and epitope.</p>Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to polyclonal, monoclonal, bispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single variable fragments (ssFv), single domain antibodies (such as VHH fragments from nanobodies), single chain fragments (scFv), Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fr",

The examples are to be considered as providing a further description of possible and potentially preferred embodiments that enhance the technical support of one or more non-limiting embodiments.</p>Binding and Blocking Characteristics of the J22.9-xi and BCMA Interaction</p>The novel chimeric antibody (J22.9-xi) binds to the extracellular domain of human CD269 (BCMA, TNFRSF17). This was initially ascertained by ELISA and flow cytometry on the human multiple myeloma cell line MM.1S (FIG. 1, (a) and (b). The affinity of J22.9-xi to BCMA was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The mean Kd is 54 pM as shown in FIG. 1, c.</p>BCMA is known to trigger signals important for the survival of multiple myeloma and plasma cells in vivo through interaction with its ligands BAFF and/or APRIL (Mackay F et al. (2003) Annu Rev Immunol 21:231-264). An in vitro blocking assay was therefore performed with the extracellular domain of human BCMA and recombinant BAFF. The binding of J22.9-xi to BCMA clearly blocks the interaction between the receptor and its ligand BAFF. Using the isotype control antibody instead of J22.9-xi, recombinant BAFF binding to BCMA is unaffected (FIG. 1, d).</p>The Crystal Structure of the J22.9-xi-Fab-BCMA-Complex Reveals an Extensive Binding Interface with BCMA</p>Fab fragments prepared from J22.9-xi were crystallized in complex with the purified 46 amino acid residue BCMA extracellular domain and the complex structure solved to 1.9 angstroms resolution. High quality electron density is observable for residues 6 to 41 of BCMA and shows an extensive interaction with J22.9-xi, primarily with the light chain of the antibody (FIG. 2, B). This interface, which buries 740.4 square angstroms and involves one third of the BCMA residues, covers 12 of 16 residues of the identical epitope observed in the crystal structures of BMCA complexes with APRIL and sTALL1 (also known as BAFF), including the conserved DxL motif (Gordon N C, et al. (2003), BAFF/BlysS receptor 3 comprises a minimal TNF receptor-like module that encodes a highly focused ligand-binding site."
