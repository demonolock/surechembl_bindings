    "first discovered in 19<sup>th </sup>century and its functions in the RAS was established thereafter. Renin controls the first step of the renin-angiotension system and catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensinogen at a unique site, releasing the decapeptide angiotensin. Renin is a highly specific protease and its only known natural substrate is angiotensinogen. Due to the high specificity and its rate-limiting nature in the RAS cascade, renin is regarded as one of the most attractive targets for the inhibition of the RAS, and enormous efforts have been made to develop potent and safe renin inhibitors.</p>The compound (2S,4S,5S,7S)\u2014N-(2-Carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-5-amino-4-hydroxy-2,7-diisopropyl-8-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxypropoxy)phenyl]-octanamide, which is disclosed in EP-A-678503, more commonly known under the name aliskiren, is one of the most important renin inhibitors, and the first renin inhibitor that has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of hypertension and related diseases. The chemical structure of aliskiren is shown in Figure 1.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US20130005730A1-20130103-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/215313291/US/20130103/A1/020130/00/57/30/US20130005730A1-20130103-C00002.TIF\"/></p>Aliskiren is being used in monotherapy for hypertension, and studies for the combination therapies such as with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are under way. Aliskiren is a potent inhibitor of renin with a Ki in the sub-nanomolar level. Aliskiren has a very good safety profile.</p>However, the renin inhibitors are known to have unfavorable properties such as an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile. For instance, they exhibit low oral bioavailability, interaction with efflux system and so on.</p>In the journal Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 2008, 47, 515-531, it is disclosed that aliskiren has a low oral bioavailability of about 2.6%. Many other renin inhibitors were also reported to have bad pharmacokinetic properties.</p>It is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least mitigate some of the disadvantages associated with renin inhibitors mentioned above.</p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThus, the present invention relates to a compound of formula (I)</p><img id=\"EMI-C00003\" path=\"US20130005730A1-20130103-C00003.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/215313069/US/20130103/A1/020130/00/57/30/US20130005730A1-20130103-C00003.TIF\"/></p>wherein\n\nR<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>independently represent\nH, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkyl, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>cycloalkyl or C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>cycloalkyl-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>alkyl, wherein said C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkyl, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>cycloalkyl or C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>cycloalkyl-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>alkyl is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, CN, NH(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkyl), N(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</",
