{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a collection of chemical compound descriptions, NMR data, and a general description of a binding assay, but it does not provide specific bioactivity data with numeric values and units."}
