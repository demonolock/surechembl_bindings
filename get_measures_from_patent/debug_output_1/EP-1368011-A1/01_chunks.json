    "not inhibiting the desired effects, such as diabetic glycemic control and improved lipid profile. As used herein \"edema and weight gain associated with hPPAR gamma agonism\" means that the edema or weight gain seen with 5 PPAR pan agonism is significantly less than that which would be expected for a hPPAR gamma agonist. For example, average weight gains of less than 5% in a human taking a therapeutically effective amount of a PPAR gamma or PPAR pan agonist would be less than expected.</p>\n  Detailed Description of the Invention 10</p>\n  Diseases, risk factors, and conditions mediated by PPAR gamma include type I diabetes, type 2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes, syndrome X, (including metabolic syndrome), insulin resistance, heart failure, dyslipidemia including diabetic dyslipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, including 15 atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and hypertriglyceridemia, epithelial hyperprol iterative diseases including eczema and psoriasis and conditions associated with the lung and gut osteoporosis, acne, cancer, and eating disorders or conditions such as obesity, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa.</p>\n  In particular, the method of this invention is useful in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM) and mixed dyslipidemia. 20 As used herein, by \"agonist\", or \"activating compound\", or \"activator\", \"exhibiting agonist activity\" or the like, is meant those compounds which have a pKi of at least 6.0 (preferably at least</p>\n  7.0) to the relevant PPAR, for example hPPAR delta,, in the binding assay described below, and which achieve at least 30% (preferably at least 50%) activation of the relevant PPAR relative to the appropriate indicated positive control in the transfection assay described below at concentrations of 25 10<sup>\"5</sup> M or less (preferably 10<sup>\"6</sup> M or less). As discussed above, hPPAR pan agonist activity may reside in a single compound or in a combination of two or more compounds.

The PPAR ligand-binding domain (LBD) was expressed in E. coli as polyHis tagged fusion proteins and purified. The LBD was then labelled with biotin and immobilised on streptavidin-modified scintillation proximity beads. The beads were then incubated with a constant amount of the appropriate radioligand and variable concentrations of test compound, and after equilibration the radioactivity bound to the beads was measured by a scintillation counter. The radioligands used were: 3H-rosiglitazone for PPARgamma (Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smith-Oliver, T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Willson, T. M.; Kliewer, S. A. J. Biol.
