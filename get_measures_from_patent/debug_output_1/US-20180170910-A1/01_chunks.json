    " mM) in water was diluted to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM in phosphate buffer and incubated with the cross-linking agent, ammonium persulphate (20 mM, 1 \u03bcL) and tris (2,2\u2032-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium (II) hexahydrate (1 mM, 1 \u03bcL) for time intervals of 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 36 h. The reaction mixture was irradiated for 30 s using filament lamp (power=150 W) by keeping it 20 cm away from the bottom of the reaction tubes. The cross-linking reaction was then quenched immediately with dithiothreitol (1 M, 1 \u03bcL, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA). The samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. followed by the addition of SDS buffer. The samples were heated at 90\u00b0 C. for 5 min. and then centrifuged. A similar process was repeated in the presence of ADH-41 at an equimolar ratio. The samples were applied to Nu-PAGE electrophoresis in 12% Bis-Tris gels with SDS-PAGE buffer. The protein samples were stained with a silver stain kit from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo., USA).</p>The technique of photo-induced cross-coupling of unmodified proteins (PICUP) was used to assess the effect of ADH-41 on the oligomerization of A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>(Bitan, G. Methods Enzymol 2006, 413, 217-236). Samples of 5 \u03bcM A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>were incubated in phosphate buffer at various time intervals in the absence and presence of ADH-41 at an equimolar ratio. The samples were subjected to PICUP and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and silver staining (FIG. 4k). A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>oligomers of various sizes ranging from 10 to 80 kD were observed within 2 h (FIG. 4k, lane 1). A similar intensity of A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>oligomeric bands was observed for samples incubated for 12 h (FIG. 4k, lane 2, 3). In contrast, no higher order oligomers of A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>were observed in the presence of ADH-41 up to 12 h (FIG. 4k, lane 6, 7) and only sparse populations were observed at 24 h and 36 h (FIG. 4k, lane 4, 5). PICUP and dot blot assays suggest that ADH-41 inhibits the formation of A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>oligomers.</p>Example 10Dot Blot Assay.Samples of A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>at concentrations from 2 \u03bcM to 5 \u03bcM were incubated at various time intervals in the absence and presence of the compounds of the invention at an equimolar ratio (see FIG. 4j). The samples were then applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and dried at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membranes were then washed (\u00d73) with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated with polyclonal A11 antibody (1/1000 dilution in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, Life Technologies Corp., Grand Island, N.Y., USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Samples were then washed (\u00d73) with TBST buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1/500 dilution in 5% nonfat free milk in TBST) at r.t. for 1 h. The dot blots were then washed with TBST buffer (\u00d73), developed using the ECL reagent kit (Amers"
