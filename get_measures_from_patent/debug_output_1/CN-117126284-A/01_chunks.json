    "and the average OD492 value was taken as the final value. Setting negative control group, and judging that the OD492 value of the experimental group is higher than 0.1 and is more than 2 times of that of the negative control groupThe antibody titer was positive. The results are shown in the table.</p>TABLE 1 ascites titer results</p>Monoclonal antibody name\nValency of\nC3-G6\n1\u00d710 <sup>8</sup>C3-H8\n1\u00d710 <sup>9</sup></p>From the results of the potency measurement in Table 1, the highest potency of 2 stable monoclonal antibody-secreting cells can reach 1X 10 <sup>9</sup> Has better effect.</p>EXAMPLE 2 analysis of biological Properties of monoclonal antibodies C3-H8</p>The affinity of the monoclonal antibody is determined by an indirect ELISA method, an enzyme-labeled reaction plate is coated with 1 mug/mL Caspase-3 protein, the monoclonal antibody diluted by a double ratio is added after the blocking, goat anti-mouse IgG marked by HRP is used as a secondary antibody, and an OD450 absorbance value is read by an enzyme-labeled instrument. When the OD450 readings of several consecutive dilutions are no longer increased, 100% binding of antigen-antibody is considered, and a scatter plot is made with the antibody concentration (mol/L) as the abscissa and the OD450 absorbance as the ordinate, generating a logarithmic trend line and formula. Half of the OD450 maximum value is brought into a formula, and the concentration of the antibody at the moment is obtained to obtain the affinity dissociation constant (Kd) of the monoclonal antibody. The results showed that the affinity dissociation constants (Kd) of the monoclonal antibodies C3-H8 were 2.04X 10, respectively <sup>-9</sup> M\u3002</p>The immunospecificity of C3-H8 mAb against Caspase-3 was identified by Western blot. Caspase-3 was reconstituted at room temperature, subjected to SDS-PAGE with 30% separation gel, electrotransferred to PVDF membrane, placed in 15% volume fraction of fresh bovine serum in PBS, and blocked at 37\u2103for 1 hour. Cutting off the sealed PVDF membrane according to the antigen band mark, taking self-made HRP marked monoclonal antibody as primary antibody, 1:200 ratio PBST dilution, 37 \u2103 incubation 1h. The PVDF membrane was developed in human ECL color development solution. Beta-actin was used as a positive control.</p>From the results shown in FIG. 3, the C3-H8 monoclonal antibodies have better specific binding effect.</p>The sequence determination of the light chain variable region and the heavy chain variable region of the monoclonal antibody C3-H8 is carried out by the principal Detai organism, and the sequences of the light chain variable region and the heavy chain variable region are respectively shown in SEQ ID NO:1 and 2.</p>Example 3 preparation of NK cells</p>Collecting 20ml venous blood of healthy volunteers, anticoagulating heparin, lightly superposing on lymphocyte separation liquid, centrifuging at room temperature for 20min at 2000r/min, sucking PBMC of an interface layer, washing cells for two times, collecting precipitated red blood cells, mixing the red blood cells and mononuclear ce"
