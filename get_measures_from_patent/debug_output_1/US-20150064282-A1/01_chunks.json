    "and dendritic cells, and subsequently blocks TLR ligand induced NFkB activation, nitric oxide (NO) production and pro-inflammatory cytokines [4]. In addition, other purified neuraminidase inhibitors such as BCX-1827, DANA (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid), zanamivir (4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en), and oseltamivir carboxylate had a limited effect on inhibition of lypopolysaccharide (LPS) induced sialidase activity in live BMC-2 macrophage cells at 1-2 mM compared to the LPS positive control.</p>Other studies using recombinant soluble human sialidases have shown that oseltamivir carboxylate scarcely inhibited the activities of the four human sialidases even at 1 mM [8], while zanamivir significantly inhibited the human Neu2 and Neu3 sialidases in the micromolar range. Furthermore, Nan et al. using lysates from mature dendritic cells have found that zanamivir completely inhibited Neu1 and Neu3 sialidase activity at 2 mM [9].</p>Interesting it has been found that oseltamivir phosphate was the most potent compared to the other neuraminidase inhibitors in inhibiting the sialidase activity associated with TLR ligand treated live macrophage cells whereas this compound is known to be ineffective as an antiviral in vitro because its antiviral activity is achieved by its hydrolytic metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate [10].</p>To further elucidate the inhibitory capacity of oseltamivir phosphate and its hydrolytic metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each compound was determined by plotting the decrease in sialidase activity against the log of the agent concentration. It was shown that oseltamivir phosphate had an IC50 of 1.175 \u03bcM compared to an IC50 of 1015 \u03bcM for oseltamivir carboxylate [4]. These data clearly illustrate that oseltamivir phosphate is 1000-fold more potent than its hydrolytic metabolite in inhibiting the sialidase activity associated with TLR ligand treated live BMC-2 macrophage cells.</p>It is possible that oseltamivir phosphate could be transported through the cell membrane by a P-glycoprotein as described by Morimoto et al. [11], where the hydrolytic activation could be catalyzed by carboxylesterase [10]. The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has been previously determined to inhibit the hydrolysis of oseltamivir phosphate by carboxylesterase as much as 90% [10]. To determine whether the oseltamivir phosphate is hydrolysed in the cell in this live cell assay system, live BMA macrophage cells were pre-treated with clopidogrel bisulfate at 280 \u03bcM and 500 \u03bcM for 2 min followed with 5 \u03bcg/mL of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of 400 \u03bcM pure oseltamivir phosphate. The results indicated that the anticarboxylesterase agent clopidogrel had no effect on oseltamivir phosphate's capacity to inhibit LPS induced sialidase activity [4]. Together, these results suggest that oseltamivir phosphate is a potent inhibitor of the sialidase associated with TLR ligand treated live macrophage cells.</p>Tyrosine Kinase (Trk) Receptor</p>The role of Neu1 sialidase as an intermediate link in the initial process of ligand induced tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptor activation and subsequent cellular fun",

There was a significant reduction in liver metastases by greater than 38% in the treated cohorts at different days post implantation when compared to the untreated control cohort. In addition, the combination of gemcitabine with oseltamivir phosphate at 5 mg/kg reduced the liver metastases by 81% compared to the untreated control cohort and further reduced the liver metastases by 10% over the monotherapy of the chemotherapeutic drug at day 109 post implantation.</p>TABLE 13The effect of co-treatment of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu)(10 mg/kg daily) and Alimta (100 mg/kg) or Abraxane (200 mg/kg) on liver metastases with PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells implanted in RAG1/C\u03b3 double mutant NOD xenograft miceLiverOseltamivirmetastasesDays postDosagephosphate(ave number%MetastasesImplantationChemo-drug(mg/kg)(mg/kg)of nodules)Inhibition(size, mm)79untreated00420.2-1.290022638%0.2-1.390052150%0.8-0.278abraxane0.502248%0.2-1.078abraxane0.521955%0.2-0.790abraxane0.552150%0.1-1.0101gemcitabine3001271%0.3-1.5110gemcitabine3021076%0.5-1.2109gemcitabine305881%0.2-1.5</p>Table 14 includes IC50 data for the inhibition of Neu1 sialidase by analogues of the antiviral agent 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyneuraminic acid (DANA).
