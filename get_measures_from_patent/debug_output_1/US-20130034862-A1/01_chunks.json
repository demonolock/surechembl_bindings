    "tion of increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis and block of differentiation. The dysregulation of one or more of the key signaling pathways (e.g., RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT) is believed to result in growth factor-independent proliferation and clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors (HOX deregulation in acute myeloid leukemia. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 2007, vol. 117, no. 4, p. 865-868.) See generally Table 1 below which depicts pathways relevant for AML Biology. In some embodiments, the pathways depicted in Table 1 are characterized using the methods described herein by exposing cells to the modulators listed in the table and measuring the readout listed in the table, for each corresponding pathways. Disruption in one or more pathways can be revealed by exposing the cells to the modulators. This can then be used for classification, diagnosis, prognosis of AML, selection of treatment and/or predict outcome after administering a therapeutic.</p>TABLE 1PathwayReadoutModulatorPathwayReadoutModulatorDNA Damagep-Chk1, p-Chk2, p-ATM, p-ATR, p-Etoposide, Ara-C/Daunorubicin, DrugH2AXPump Inhibitors, MylotargDrug transportersMDR-1, ABCG2, MPRDrug Pump InhibitorsApoptosisBcl-2, Mcl-1, cytochrome c, survivin,Staurosporine, Etoposide, Ara-XIAP PARP, Caspses 3, 7 and 8C/Daunorubicin, Drug Pump Inhibitors,Mylotarg, Zvad, Caspase Inhibitors,PhosphatasesShp-1, Shp-2,, CD45H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>JAK/STATp-Stat 1, 3, 4, 5, 6Cytokine and Growth FactorsCell CycleMyc, Ki-67, Cyclins, DNA stains, p-Cytokine and Growth Factors,RB, p16, p21, p27, p15, cyclin D1,Mitogens, Apoptosis inducing agents,cyclin B1, p-Cdk1, p-histoneH3, p-CDC25MAPKRas, p-Mek, p-Erk, p-S6, p-38Cytokine and Growth Factors,Mitogens,PI3K-AKTp-Akt, p-S6, p-PRAS40, p-GSK3, p-Cytokines, Growth Factors, Mitogens,TSC2, p-p70S6K, 4-EBP1, p-FOXOchemokines, Receptor Tyrosine Kinaseproteins(RTK) ligandsFLT3 and other RTKsp-PLCg 1/2, p-CREB, total CREB,Flt3L, Receptor Tyrosine Kinasep-Akt, p-Erk, p-S6(RTK) ligandsAngiogenesisPLC\u03b31, p-Akt, p-ErkVEGF stimWnt/b-cateninActive B-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin DRTK ligands, growth factorsSurvivalPI3K, PLCg, StatsRKT Growth Factors</p>There are two main classes of receptors which play an important role in hematopoiesis: Receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (RTKs) and those that do not contain their own enzymatic activity and often consist of heterodimers of a ligand-binding alpha subunit and a signal transducing beta subunit, which is frequently shared between a subset of cytokine receptors. Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases phosphorylate cytokine receptors thereby creating docking sites for signaling molecules resulting in activation of a specific intracellular signaling pathway. Of the first class, Kit and FLt3 receptor have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML. Extracellular ligand binding regulates the intracellular substrate specificity, affinity and kinase activity of these proteins. Therefore, the receptor ",

Grouping of data points increases predictive value.</p>In some embodiments, the AML or other panel of modulators is further expanded to examine the process of DNA damage, apoptosis, drug transport, drug metabolism, and the use of peroxide to evaluate phosphatase activity. Analysis can assess the ability of the cell to undergo the process of apoptosis after exposure to the experimental drug in an in vitro assay as well as how quickly the drug is exported out of the cell or metabolized. The drug response panel can include but is not limited to detection of phosphorylated Chk2, Cleaved Caspase 3, Caspase 8, PARP and mitochondria-released Cytoplasmic Cytochrome C. Modulators may include Stauro, Etoposide, Mylotarg, AraC, and daunorubicin. Analysis can assess phosphatase activity after exposure of cells to phosphatase inhibitors including but not limited to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+SCF and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+IFN\u03b1. The response panel to evaluate phosphatase activity can include but is not limited to the detection of phosphorylated Slp76, PLCg2, Lck, S6, Akt, Erk, Stat1, Sta3, and Stat5. Later, the samples may be analyzed for the expression of drug transporters such as MDR1/PGP, MRP1 and BCRP/ABCG2. Samples may also be examined for XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-2, MCL-1, Bim, Ki-67, Cyclin D1, ID1 and Myc.</p>Another method of the present invention is a method for determining the prognosis and therapeutic selection for an individual with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Using the signaling nodes and methodology described herein, multiparametric flow could separate a patient into \u201ccytarabine responsive\u201d, meaning that a cytarabine based induction regimen would yield a complete response or \u201ccytarabine non-responsive\u201d, meaning that the patient is unlikely to yield a complete response to a cytarabine based induction regimen. Furthermore, for those patients unlikely to benefit from cytarabine based therapy, the individual's blood or marrow sample could reveal signaling biology that corresponds to either in-vivo or in-vitro sensitivity to a class of drugs including but not limited to direct drug resistance modulators, anti-Bcl-2 or pro-apoptotic drugs, proteosome inhibitors, DNA methyl transferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic drugs, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, FLt3 ligand inhibitors, or ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors. An individual with AML with a complete response to induction therapy could further benefit from the present invention. The individual's blood or marrow sample could reveal signaling biology that corresponds to likelihood of benefit from further cytarabine based chemotherapy versus myeloablative therapy followed by and stem cell transplant versus reduced intensity therapy followed by stem cell transp"
