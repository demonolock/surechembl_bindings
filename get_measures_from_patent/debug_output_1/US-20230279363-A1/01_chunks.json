Biol. </i>196: 901-917). The CDRs can also be referenced according to the IMGT system for the identification of CDRs, which is described in Lefranc MP. Unique database numbering system for immunogenetic analysis. Immunol Today (1997) 18:509. As used herein, the term \u201cframework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues. CDRs provide the majority of contact residues for the binding of the antibody to the antigen or epitope. CDRs of interest can be derived from donor antibody variable heavy and light chain sequences, and include analogs of the naturally occurring CDRs, which analogs also share or retain the same antigen binding specificity and/or neutralizing ability as the donor antibody from which they were derived.</p><p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">As used herein, \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cimmunospecific binding\u201d or \u201cbinds immunospecifically\u201d refer to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen at a much higher affinity than for another antigen(s). In some embodiments, the antibody binds the predetermined antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, and such K<sub>D </sub>is at least two-fold less than its K<sub>D </sub>for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein, or another non-specific polypeptide).</p><p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">Methods for determining mAb specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988), Colligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1992, 1993), and Muller, Meth.
