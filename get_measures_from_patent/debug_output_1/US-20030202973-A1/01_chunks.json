    "gress in new therapy development depends on understanding the mechanisms of cell proliferation in both normal cells and cancerous cells. </p>[0004] Normal cells proliferate by the highly controlled activation of growth factor receptors by their respective ligands. Examples of such receptors are the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. </p>[0005] Cancer cells also proliferate by the activation of growth factor receptors by mitogenic ligands, but lose the careful control of normal proliferation. The loss of control may be caused by numerous factors, such as the overexpression of growth factors and/or receptors, and autonomous activation of biochemical pathways regulated by mitogenic growth factors. </p>[0006] Some examples of receptors involved in tumorigenesis are the receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), insulin-like growth factor (IGFR), nerve growth factor (NGFR), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). </p>[0007] Some examples of mitogenic ligands that bind these receptors that are involved in tumorigenesis are epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). </p>[0008] Members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family are particularly important growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases associated with tumorigenesis of epidermal cells. The first member of the EGF receptor family to be discovered was the glycoprotein having an apparent molecular weight of approximately 165 kD. This glycoprotein, which was described by Mendelsohn et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,533, is known as the EGF receptor (EGFR) and also as human EGF receptor-1 (HER1). The EGFR is overexpressed on many types of epidermoid tumor cells. </p>[0009] Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) are two known well-known ligands of EGF receptor (EGFR). Naturally occurring ligands, inter alia, which bind EGFR are to be called epidermal growth factor receptor mitogenic ligands and abbreviated as EGFRML. </p>[0010] The inhibition of EGFRMLs binding EGFR is the logic behind this invention. It is the key to the methods below described for treating and palliating the course and progression of refractory cancers. Inhibiting naturally occurring mitogens will inhibit the growth of tumors. </p>[0011] Examples of tumors that express EGF receptors include glioblastomas, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, head and neck, and bladder. The amplification and/or overexpression of the EGF receptors on the membranes of tumor cells are associated with a poor prognosis. Poor prognosis may also be a consequence of an excess the mitogenic epidermal growth factor stimulating the EGF receptors. </p>[0012] Treatments of cancer traditionally include chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Some examples of chemotherapeutic agents include doxorubicin, cisplatin, and taxol. The radiation can be either from an external beam or from a source placed inside a patient, i.e., brachyth"
