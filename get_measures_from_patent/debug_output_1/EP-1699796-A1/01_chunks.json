Total assay volume for the binding studies was 100 \u03bcl. 5 \u03bcg of membranes were brought up to a final volume of 95 \u03bcl with Binding Buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.25% BSA). The diluted membranes were preincubated with a compound or DMSO vehicle. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 nM final <sup>3</sup>H-CP-55,940 (120 Ci/mmol) and proceeded for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The binding reaction was terminated by transfening the reaction to GF B 96 well plates (presoaked with 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a Packard Cell Harvester. The filter was washed with 0.25x PBS, 30 \u03bcl MicroScint was added per well, and the bound radiolabel was quantitated by scintillation counting on a Packard TopCount Scintillation Counter. The CB-2 \n\nradioligand binding assay was conducted identically except that the membranes from CHO-CB-2 cells were used. For a compound to be considered a CB-1 antagonist, the compound must possess a CB-1 receptor binding affinity Ki less than 13000 nM. As determined by the assay described above, the CB-1 receptor binding K, values of working Examples 1-63 fall within the range of 0.01 nM to 10000 nM.</p>Cannabinoid Receptor Functional Activity Assay Functional CB-1 inverse agonist activity of test compounds was determined in CHO-CB-1 cells using a cAMP accumulation assay. CHO-CB-1 cells were grown in 96 well plates to near confluence. On the day of the functional assay, growth medium was aspirated and 100 of Assay Buffer (PBS plus 25 mM HEPES / 0.1 mM 3- isobutyl-1-methylxanthine/ 0.1 % BSA) was added. Compounds were added to the Assay buffer diluted 1:100 from 100% DMSO and allowed to preincubate for 10 minutes prior to addition of 5 uM forskolin. The mixture was allowed to proceed for 15 minutes at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of 0.1 N HC1. The total intracellular cAMP concentration was quantitated using the Amersham cAMP SPA kit. UTILITIES AND COMBINATIONS</p>Utilities The compounds of the present invention are cannabinoid receptor modulators, and include compounds which are, for example, selective agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the cannabinoid receptor.
