Macrocyclization has been applied to apelin isoforms and Elabela, resulting in molecules with significantly improved stability (plasma half-life between 5 hours and 24 hours as compared to those of apelin-13 and Elabela 24-30 min).

To investigate their role in receptor binding of macrocyclic analogs, the affinities of compounds 20 (N-terminal acetylation), 22 (absence of N-terminal amine), 24 (Arg4Nle) was determined on APJ E20A and D23A mutant receptors since these mutations were previously demonstrated as potential binding sites of cationic parts of apelin (Table IV). The results showed that the affinities of 20, 22 and 24 are less affected by these mutations (&lt; 2.5-fold change) compared to those of Ape13 (decreasing 2.4- to 7.7-fold), suggesting that the E20 and D23 of APJ may not play a significant role in the binding of those macrocyclic analogs but they may be important to confer a higher affinity to compounds with positive charges in the N-terminal part. </p><p id=\"p0448\" num=\"0448\">Table IV.

Their effect on blood pressure was assessed at two doses of 19.6 and 65 nmol/kg. The dose at 19.6 nmol/kg corresponds to the maximum effect of Ape13 while the higher dose of 65 nmol/kg was chosen to ascertain if a less potent analog can produce an effect. </p><p id=\"p0461\" num=\"0461\">The truncated analogs gradually lost their effect on blood pressure when their size was reduced, along with their ability to recruit \u03b2-arrestin2 (Besserer-Offroy et al., 2018). Compound 15 ( \u03b2-arr2 EC50 33 nM, Emax 115%) produced a drop in blood pressure (AMABP -40 mmHg) similar to Ape13 and the response lasted slightly longer, possibly due to the longer half-life and higher potency in the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin2 (FIG. 14). In contrast, analog 20 (\u03b2-arr2 EC50 143 nM, E<sub>max</sub> 98%) having a truncated N-terminal tail, did not reach the same magnitude of response as Ape13 even at the high dose tested (AMABP -27 mmHg) (FIG. 14). Similarly, analog 29 ( \u03b2-arr2 EC50 743 nM, Emax 69%) having both N-terminal and C-terminal truncation displayed little effect on blood pressure (AMABP -13 mmHg) while 43 (\u03b2-arr2 EC50 232 nM, Emax 55%) showed no effect. Compound 42 induced a smaller drop in blood pressure (AMABP -24 mmHg) than Ape13 despite a similar potency on the APJ binding (31, Kj 0.6 nM vs Ape13, Kj 0.6 nM) and the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin2 (42, EC50 31 nM vs Ape13, EC50 37 nM). The difference could be explained by the lower maximum efficacy of 42 on \u03b2- arrestin2 recruitment (E<sub>max</sub> 70%), indicative of its partial agonist activity on this pathway. Likewise, compound 43 had only partial efficacy (E<sub>max</sub> 55%) and a lower potency (43, EC50 232 nM) on the b-arrestin2 pathway, which most-likely explains its lack of efficacy on blood pressure. </p><p id=\"p0462\" num=\"0462\">EXAMPLE 14: Effects on cardiac performance </p><p id=\"p0463\" num=\"0463\">Using echocardiography, the inventors studied the cardiac effects of the macrocycles 42 and 43 which exhibit small size, good affinity for APJ as well as improved in vitro and in vivo half-lives. It should also be reminded that both compounds are full agonists with good potency on G\u03b1i1 while they are both partial agonists on \u03b2-arrestin but that 42 is more potent (by 6.2- to 7.5-fold) than 43 on those pathways. </p><p id=\"p0464\" num=\"0464\">To demonstrate whether peptides with higher stability can maintain the cardiovascular effect following a single bolus administration, Ape13 and the two macrocycles 42 and 43 were administered to rats by subcutaneous injection (s.c.) at two doses, 0.2 pmol/kg (low) and 2 pmol/kg (high, nearly 2 mg/kg for the macrocycle). Left ventricular fractional shortening (FS), an indicator of cardiac contraction, as well as cardiac output (CO), which shows overall cardiac performance, were monitored (FIGs. 15A-B). Three hours after injection, no observable effect was detected for Ape13 at 0.2 pmol/kg while 42 showed a significant increase only in FS and 43 showed a significant increase in both FS and CO, consistent with their longer half-life. </p><p id=\"p0465\" num=\"0465\">At the highest dose tested of 2 pmol/kg, Ape13, 42 and 43 all showed a signifi",
