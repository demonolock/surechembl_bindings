As used herein, the term \u201cRAS(OFF) inhibitor\u201d refers to an inhibitor that targets, that is, selectively binds to or inhibits the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS (e.g., selective over the GTP-bound, active state of RAS). Inhibition of the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS includes, for example, sequestering the inactive state by inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby inhibiting RAS from adopting the active conformation. In certain embodiments, RAS(OFF) inhibitors may also bind to or inhibit the GTP-bound, active state of RAS (e.g., with a lower affinity or inhibition constant than for the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS). A RAS(OFF) inhibitor may be mutant-selective, such as selective for a G12C, G12D or G12V mutant. A RAS(OFF) inhibitor may be selective for more than one mutant, or selective for one or more mutants and for wild-type (in either situation, a \u201cpan-RAS(OFF)\u201d inhibitor). Methods of measuring RAS(OFF) inhibition are known in the art. As used herein, the term \u201cRAS(ON) inhibitor\u201d refers to a non-covalent tri-complex-forming inhibitor that targets, that is, selectively binds to or inhibits, the GTP-bound, active state of RAS (e.g., selective over the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS). Inhibition of the GTP-bound, active state of RAS includes, for example, the inhibition of oncogenic signaling from the GTP-bound, active state of RAS. In some embodiments, the RAS(ON) inhibitor is an inhibitor that selectively binds to and inhibits the GTP- bound, active state of RAS. In certain embodiments, RAS(ON) inhibitors may also bind to or inhibit the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS (e.g., with a lower affinity or inhibition constant than for the GTP- bound, active state of RAS). RAS(ON) inhibitors are non-covalent binders of the GTP-bound form of RAS, and persons of skill in the art are familiar with methods of determining if crosslinking has occurred. In some embodiments, a RAS(ON) inhibitor does not comprise a crosslinking group, such as crosslinking groups found in the art (e.g., WO 2020/132597, WO 2021/091982, WO 2021/091967, WO 2022/235864, WO 2022/235870, WO 2023/060253, PCT/US2023/037057 and WO 2023/133543).

Methods of determining RAS(ON) inhibition are known in the art. See, e.g., WO 2021/091956, WO 2022/060836 and WO 2023/240263. As used herein, a \u201cRAS(ON) GTP hydrolysis-promoting compound\u201d refers to a tri-complex- forming compound that, when bound in a tri-complex (i.e. CYPA-RAS(ON) GTP hydrolysis-promoting compound-RAS(ON) isoform), exhibits a RAS(ON) GTP hydrolysis ",
