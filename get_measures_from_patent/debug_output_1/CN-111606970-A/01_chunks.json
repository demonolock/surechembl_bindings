    " Compound b and benzhydrylamine were reacted using method two to give compound c (129mg, 0.23mmol) as a pale yellow oil. And dissolving the compound c in 5mL of hydrochloric acid methanol, reacting at room temperature for 2h, and spin-drying to obtain a white solid compound e, wherein the next reaction is carried out without aftertreatment. Compound e was reacted with N-Boc-N-methylalanine according to method two to give compound f (128mmg, 0.2 mmol). Compound f was dissolved in 3mL of trifluoroacetic acid and reacted at room temperature for 2h to give the final product as a white solid (103 mg.0.19mmol).<sup>1</sup>H NMR(300MHz,Methanol-d4)7.33\u20137.08(m,10H),6.04(d,J\uff1d3.5Hz,1H),4.72\u20134.62(m,1H),4.56(d,J\uff1d14.7Hz,1H),4.49\u20134.38(m,1H),4.05\u20133.73(m,3H),3.36\u20133.22(m,1H),3.02\u20132.68(m,1H),2.60(s,3H),2.54\u20132.11(m,3H),2.10\u20131.66(m,4H),1.46(dd,J\uff1d8.4,6.9Hz,3H),0.89(dd,J\uff1d6.6,4.2Hz,6H)\u3002</p>The resulting end product was assayed for protein binding and cell activity according to the methods described in the literature (Cai, Q.; Sun, H.; Peng, Y.; Lu, J.; Nikolovska-Coleska, Z.; McEachern, D.; Liu, L.; Qiu, S.; Yang, C.Y.; Miller, R.; Yi, H.; Zhang, T.; Sun, D.; Kang, S.; Guo, M.; Leopold, L.; Yang, D.; Wang, S., A post and organic active antagonist (SM-406/AT-406) of multiple Inhibition of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) in a closed expression for expression vectors J.J.Chem, 54(8), 20114-27126). XIAP BIR3 Competitive FP Assay showed that the protein binding ability of the compound to IAP-BIR3 protein is: IC 50-428 nM, Ki-70.5 nM; the cellular activity for MDA-MB-231 was: IC50 \u2550 8.69 uM. The mother nucleus synthesized by the compound has certain bioactivity, can combine and inhibit IAPs (amyloid peptide protein) and inhibit the growth of cancer cells, and is used for preparing medicaments for treating and preventing tumors.</p>"
