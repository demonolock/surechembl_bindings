    "nsduction inhibited, and this effect can by for example suppress part in conjunction with, receptor dimerization turn into or Tyrosylprotein kinase itself realize.Signal also capable of blocking is to the more transduction of downstream portion.</p>The biological property of new compound is following to be studied:</p>The inhibition of EGF-R-Mediated Signal Transduction can be by for example using expressing human EGF-R and its survival and propagation to depend on EGF or TGF-\u03b1 stimulated cells is proved.System carries out improvement of genes to the Muridae hematopoietic cell, thereby is used for expressive function people EGF-R.Therefore, the propagation of this clone can be stimulated by EGF.</p>Test following carrying out:</p>Cell is cultivated in the RPMI/1640 substratum.Use 20ng/ml people EGF (Promega) to stimulate proliferation.In order to study the inhibition activity of The compounds of this invention, these compounds are dissolved in 100% methyl-sulphoxide, and are added in this culture with different diluents, maximum DMSO concentration is 1%.This culture was cultivated 48 hours at 37 \u2103.</p>In order to measure the inhibition activity of The compounds of this invention, (AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Promega) measures relative cell count with O.D. unit to use Cell Titer 96TM water-based non-radioactive active cells proliferation assay.This relative cell count is calculated as the per-cent with control group, and the active material concentration (IC50) when per-cent calculates out propagation 50% capable of inhibiting cell thus.</p>For example, the IC50 that compound of Formula I of the present invention demonstrates\uff1c10 \u03bc M, preferred\uff1c1 \u03bc M.Obtained for example following result:</p>Compound (embodiment number)EGFR-dependency inhibition of proliferation IC\n                      <sub>50</sub>[nM]\n                    1 (trans-compound)??11 (1) (trans-compound)??11 (3) (trans-compound)??11 (5) (trans-compound)??1??(36)??1??(44)??1</p>Therefore compound of Formula I of the present invention can suppress signal transduction through Tyrosylprotein kinase, proves as the example by people EGF acceptor, and so can be used for treating the physiological and pathological process that the hyperfunction because of Tyrosylprotein kinase causes.These are the tumour in for example optimum or malignant tumour, especially epithelium and neuro epithelium source, the transfer of vascular endothelial cell and undesired propagation (neovascularity hyperplasia).</p>The compounds of this invention also can be used for preventing and treats because of stimulating Tyrosylprotein kinase to cause mucous membrane to produce increasing or change respiratory tract and the pulmonary disorder of following, for example inflammatory diseases of respiratory tract such as chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis, supersensitivity or non-allergic rhinitis or sinusitis paranasal sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, \u03b11-Kang Yidanbaimeiquefazheng or cough, pulmonary emphysema, lung fibrosis and respiratory tract overreaction.</p>"
