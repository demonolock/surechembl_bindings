    "fer. Filter bound radioactivity is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Non-linear curve fitting of the overall data for each drug averaged for each concentration is done using Prism (GraphPad). The data are fit to a partial instead of a full inhibition model if the sum of squares is significantly lower by F-test. Similarly, the data are fit to a two component instead of a one component inhibition model if the sum of squares is significantly lower by F-test. The concentration of test compound producing 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of specific binding and the maximal extent of inhibition (I<sub>max</sub>) are determined for the individual experiments with the same model used for the overall data and then the means \u00b1 SEM.s of the individual experiments are calculated. Picrotoxin serves as the positive control for these studies as it has been demonstrated to robustly inhibit TBPS binding.</p>Various compounds are or can be screened to determine their potential as modulators of [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS binding in vitro. These assays are or can be performed in accordance with the above discussed procedures.</p>For Table 1, \"A\" indicates an IC<sub>50</sub>&lt; 10 nM, \"B\" indicates an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10 nM to 50 nM, \"C\" indicates an IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;50 nM to 100 nM, \"D\" indicates an IC<sub>50</sub>&gt; 100 nM to 500 nM, and \"E\" indicates IC<sub>50</sub>&gt; 500 nM.\nTable 1.
