{"raw_mentions": "After analyzing the provided text snippet, I was unable to find any sentences or table rows that meet the specified criteria, which require the presence of all four components:\n1. A specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier.\n2. A bioactivity metric (e.g., IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, pIC50, pEC50, pKi, pKd).\n3. A specific numeric value for that metric (e.g., \"10\", \"5.5\", \"<100\").\n4. A unit for that value (e.g., \"nM\", \"uM\", \"%\").\n\nThe text appears to be a list of various chemical compounds and their names or identifiers, but it does not provide any bioactivity metrics or specific numeric values with units. Therefore, I do not have any relevant sentences or table rows to return."}
