    "nthesize and secrete low-density lipoproteins, were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a hquid medium containing radio- actively labelled leucine. Thus radioactively labelled leucine was incorporated into the apolipoprotein B. The liquid medium was decanted and the apolipoprotein B was isolated by means of a double immunoprecipitation, i.e. first an apolipoprotein B-specific antibody (antibodyi) was added to the hquid medium and subsequently a second antibody (antibody2) was added which binds specifically to the apoB-antibodyi- complex. The thus formed apoB-antibodyi-antibody2 complex precipitated and was isolated by centrifuge. Quantification of the amount of apolipoprotein B synthesized during the night resulted from measuring the radioactivity of the isolated complex. To measure the inhibiting activity of the test compound, that test compound was added to the liquid medium at different concentrations and the concentration of apolipoprotein B synthesized in the presence of a test compound (concentration apoB (after)) was compared to the concentration of apolipoprotein B which was synthesized in the absence of the test compound (concentration apoB (control)). For each experiment the inhibition of apohpoprotein-B formation was expressed as</p>1 - concentration of apoB(after)</p>% inhibition = 100 x concentration apoB (control)</p>When more experiments were carried out for the same concentration, the median value of the inhibition calculated for these experiments was calculated. IC50-values</p>(concentration of the drug needed to reduce apoB secretion to 50 % of the control) were also computed. \n\n Table 12 lists the IC50-values for some of the exemphfied compounds of formula (I).</p>Exemplified compounds of formula (I) that are not hsted in Table 12, and for which data is available, have an IC50- value of 1 x 10<sup>\"</sup>\" M or more.</p>Table 12</p><img id=\"imgf000032_0001\" path=\"imgf000032_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168312588/WO/19990514/A1/001999/02/27/38/imgf000032_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000032_0002\" path=\"imgf000032_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168312589/WO/19990514/A1/001999/02/27/38/imgf000032_0002.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000032_0003\" path=\"imgf000032_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168312590/WO/19990514/A1/001999/02/27/38/imgf000032_0003.tif\"/>\nExample 2 a) preparation of a physical mixture</p>A 100/300 (w/w) mixture of Compound A (1 kg) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2910 5 mPa.s or HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s (3 kg) were both sieved and mixed in a planetary mixer until the mixture was homogenous. b) preparing the melt extrudate</p>The physical mixture was fed into a twin screw melt extruder of the type APN-Baker MP19 PH 25:1 having the following operating parameters : temperature of the first compartment Tl was 50-80\u00b0C, T2 = 180-200\u00b0C, T3 = 200-220\u00b0C, T4 = 200-220\u00b0C, T5 = 200-220\u00b0C, the twin screw had a rate of 50 - 500 revolutions/min and was extruded during 120 minutes. The extrudate was brought in a hammer mill of type Fitzmill, the mesh of the sieve was 850 \u03bcm and revolving speed was 4760 revolutions per minute. The milled extrudate was again brought in a hammer mill, this time with a sieve of mesh 500 \u03bcm and a revolving speed of 4760 revolutions per minute. c) pre"
