It has been determined that ThS competed with [<sup>3</sup>H]CG for binding sites on A\u03b2 (1-40), but ThT did not (see, e.g., Fig. 5). High specific activity [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 (see Table 1) was then synthesized by methylation of BTA-0. Bindings studies were performed with [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 and 200 nM A\u03b2(1-40) fibrils. The specific binding of [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 was <sup>\u223c</sup>70%. Fig. 5 (see the right panel) shows competition curves for A\u03b2 sites by ThT, BTA-0, BTA-1, and BTA-2 using the [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 binding assay. The Ki's were: 3.0 \u00b1 0.8 nM for BTA-2; 9.6 \u00b1 1.8 nM for BTA-1; 100 \u00b1 16 nM for BTA-0; and 1900 \u00b1 510 nM for ThT. Not only is the quaternary amine of ThT not necessary for binding to A\u03b2 fibrils, it appears to decrease binding affinity as well.</p>In Table 1 below are five different <sup>11</sup>C-labeled BTA derivatives where their in vitro binding properties, logP values, and in vivo brain uptake and retention properties in mice have been determined.\nTable 1.

These compounds displayed relatively high affinity for A\u03b2, with Ki values &lt; 10 nM, and readily entered mouse brain with uptake values &gt;0.4 %/D/g*kg (or &gt; 13% ID/g for 30 g animals). Moreover, the 30 min brain radioactivity concentration values were less than 0.1 %ID/g*kg, resulting in 2 min-to-30 min concentration ratios &gt;4. Both of the N,N-dimethyl compounds cleared less rapidly from mouse brain tissue than the N-methyl derivatives. Likewise, the only primary amine currently testable, 6-MeO-BTA-0, showed poor brain clearance. This surprising and unexpected result supports the specific use of the secondary amine (e.g. -NHCH<sub>3</sub>) as in vivo imaging agent.</p>Example 7: In Vivo PET Imaging Experiments in BaboonsLarge amounts of high specific activity (&gt;2000 Ci/mmol) <sup>11</sup>C-labeled BTA-1, 6-Me-BTA-1, and 6-MeO-BTA-1 were prepared for brain imaging studies in 20-30 kg anesthetized baboons using the Siemens/CTI HR+ tomograph in 3D data collection mode (nominal FWHM resolution 4.5 mm). Brain imaging studies were conducted following the intravenous injection of 3-5 mCi of radiotracer. Typical attenuation- and decay-corrected time-activity curves for a frontal cortex region of interest for each of the three compounds are shown in Fig. 6. It is noted that the absolute brain uptake of these 3 compounds in baboons is very similar to that in mice (i.e., about 0.47 to 0.39 %ID/g*kg). However, the normal brain clearance rate of all three radiotracers is considerably slower in baboons compared to mice, with peak-to-60 min "
