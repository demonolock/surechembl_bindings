    "ession of the truncated tau fragment of the PHF core in eukaryotic cells is difficult to achieve. Transient expression systems permit the optimization of expression of tau, but the inherent toxicity of the fragments renders even these systems unreliable. Longer fragments of tau are less toxic, but these do not reliably aggregate when expressed in cells.</p>\n  Thus it would be desirable for an alternative model system to be developed, in which the interaction between e.g. tau molecules and the like could be investigated under physiological conditions, in a \n\nstable and controllable cell line, and which could be used to screen for potential diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic agents of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n  Disclosure of the invention</p>\n  The present inventors have devised a stable cellular test system which can be used to model the template-driven proteolytic processing of a protein, the aggregation of which is associated with neurodegenerative disease. In one test system, exemplified with the tau protein, very low level constitutive expression of a fragment of the tau protein was combined with inducible expression of full-length tau. Induction of the full-length tau lead to its proteolytic conversion to a processed fragment, confirming that \"te plated proteolytic processing\" of the tau was occurring. The system readily permits the demonstration of the effects of tau aggregation inhibitors through their inhibition of production of the processed, 12 kD, fragment from induced full-length tau.</p>\n  That such a stable system can be achieved notwithstanding the inherent toxic properties of the 12 kD fragment is particularly surprising. For instance, as demonstrated in the Examples below, although partial truncation at either N- or C-termini of full- length tau results in cell lines in which stable expression can be maintained, these longer constructs show only a weak propensity to aggregate, rather than binding to the microtubular network. Stable expression of combinations of tau fragments generates aggregates within the cytoplasm of cells, but this system cannot be maintained reproducibly . Systems based on the inducible expression of the 12 kD fragment lead to toxicity as a result of unpredictable intracellular aggregation of the fragment.</p>\n  Thus there would appear to be a trade-off in stable expression cell systems between inducing aggregation and hence toxicity on the one hand, which produces cell lines which are either variable or non- viable, and maintaining viable cell lines in which tau has a low propensity to aggregate. Notwithstanding this, the inducible tau expression system of the present invention is both stable, and yet \n\nable to provide controlled aggregation of protein for use in screens and the like.</p>\n  Additionally, use of the assay has provided evidence that the mechanism of action of certain inhibitors (e.g. phenothiazines) of protein aggregation is primarily steric in nature, rather than essentially redox, as may have been suspected on the basis of the prior art. This discovery has unexpected implications for the choice, assessment, formulation and use of such compounds in the context of the diseases discussed herein. In particular, it shows that assessment of diffusion coefficients can provide a valuable screen for identifying putative inhibitors, or optimising the structure or state of known ones, because the parameters inherently assessed by measuring the diffusion coefficient may be highly relevant to the inhibitors' potency.</p>\n  The assay further shows that use of phenothiazines in their reduced form can be advantageous for enhancing their inhibitory properties . These observatio",
    "below.</p>\n  The present inventors have demonstrated that it is unexpectedly possible to constitutively express the template fragment at a</p>\n  (first) concentration which is not toxic to the cell line i.e. the cell line is viable. Nor does it show cellular abnormalities of the sort shown e.g. in WO 96/30766 at Fig 29.</p>\n  Nevertheless (e.g. at a time predetermined by addition of the stimulus) it is possible to seed the processing of the precursor protein to a product fragment (which may be the same, broadly equivalent, or quite different to the template fragment) which can thus accumulate to a (second, higher) concentration which is toxic to the cell and which corresponds to the disease state. This in turn provides convenient methods for modeling the disease state associated with the effects of the product fragment, and assessing the effect of modulators on the generation of the product fragment.</p>\n  In various other, discrete, embodiments the invention provides corresponding methods for any of initiating, seeding, or controlling the proteolytic processing and optionally aggregation of the precursor protein to the product fragment. \n\nIn each case the method may involve monitoring (directly or indirectly) the level of proteolytic processing of the precursor protein.</p>\n  In one embodiment of the present invention fibroblast cells (3T6) express full-length tau (\"T40\") under the control of an inducible promotor and low constitutive levels of the PHF-core tau fragment (12 kD fragment) . When T40 expression is induced in this system, it undergoes aggregation-dependent truncation within the cell, N- terminally at ~a.a.295 and C-terminally at ~a.a.390, thereby producing higher levels of the 12 kD PHF-core domain fragment. Production of the 12 kD fragment can be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by tau-aggregation inhibitors . Indeed the quantitation of inhibitory activity of compounds with respect to proteolytic generation of the 12 kD fragment within cells can be described entirely in terms of the same parameters which describe inhibition of tau-tau binding in vitro. That is, extent of proteolytic generation of the 12 kD fragment within cells is determined entirely by the extent to tau-tau binding through the repeat domain. The availability of the relevant proteases within the cell is non-limiting.</p>\n  Precursor proteins and diseases (including tauopathies)</p>\n  As stated above, the invention may be based around the use of any protein which is associated with a disease in which the protein undergoes an induced conformational polymerisation interaction i.e. one in which a conformational change of the protein, or in a fragment thereof, gives rise to templated binding and aggregation of further (precursor) protein molecules in a self-propagating manner .</p>\n  Once nucleation is initiated, an aggregation cascade may ensue which involves the induced conformational polymerisation of further protein molecules, leading to the formation of toxic product fragments in aggregates which are substantially resistant to further proteolysis. The protein aggregates thus formed are \n\nthought to be a proximal cause of neurodegeneration, clinical dementia, and other pathological symptoms of this group of diseases .</p>\n  Preferred embodiments of the invention are based on tau protein. Where used herein, the term \"tau protein\" refers generally to any protein of the tau protein family. Tau proteins are characterised as being one among a larger number of protein families which co- purify with microtubules during repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly (Shelanski et al . (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, ",
    "ccurs naturally in the course of PHF assembly in Alzheimer's disease (Mena et al . (1995), (1996), loc. cit.; Novak et al . (1993), loc . cit.; Mena et al . (1991), loc . cit . ) . Additionally, when tau is bound via the repeat domain in vitro, digestion with a protease (e.g. pronase) generates a fragment detectable by mAb 423 (see Wischik et al, 1996, loc cit) . In the preferred aspects of the present invention, as it relates to tau protein, this antibody may be used to distinguish the generation of proteolytically cleaved product fragment (Glu-391 termination) from constitutive expression of template fragment (Ala-390) .</p>\n  - Those which recognise a generic tau epitope in the repeat domain. A preferred embodiment utilises an antibody (e.g. MAb 7.51). Where \n\ntau-MAP2 or MAP2-MAP2 aggregation is to be detected, an antibody which detects a generic MAP2 epitope could be used. Antibody 7.51 recognises a generic tau epitope located in the antepenultimate repeat of tau (Novak et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 5837-5841) , which is occluded when tau is bound in a PHF-like immunochemical configuration but can be exposed after formic acid treatment (Harrington et al . ( 1990), (1991), loc . cit . ; Wischik et al . (1995a), loc. cit . ) . Normal soluble tau, or tau bound to microtubules, can be detected using mAb 7.51 without formic acid treatment (Harrington et al . (1991), loc . cit.; Wischik et al . (1995a), loc . cit . ) . Binding of full-length tau in the tau-tau binding assay is associated with partial occlusion of the mAb 7.51 epitope .</p>\n  Antibody 27/342 recognises a non-species specific generic tau epitope located between Ser-208 and Ser-238 which is partially occluded in the course of the tau-tau interaction (Lai, loc . cit . ) .</p>\n  The binding sites of some monoclonal antibodies are shown in Figure 6.</p>\n  Screening for modulators and inhibitors</p>\n  As described above, the invention is preferably concerned with use of a system as provided herein, in a method of modeling, and identifying therapeutic agents for treatment of, the diseases discussed herein.</p>\n  A typical method for assessing the ability of an agent to modulate the aggregation and\\or proteolytic processing of a precursor protein to a product in response to interaction with a template fragment, may comprise:</p>\n  (a) providing a stable cell or cell line as discussed above,</p>\n  (b) subjecting the cell to the stimulus such that the precursor protein is expressed in the cell and whereby interaction of the template fragment with the precursor protein causes a conformational change in the protein such as to cause aggregation and proteolytic processing of the precursor protein to a product \n\nfragment,</p>\n  (c) monitoring the production of the product fragment in the presence of the agent,</p>\n  (d) optionally comparing the value obtained in step (c) with a reference value.</p>\n  The reference value may be based on historical observation, or may be based on co",
    "odel for distribution of MB following single 100 mg dose in a 70 kg subject, assuming instantaneous absorbtion (Fig 19B) . Urinary excretion accounts for 54 - 98% of the ingested dose. This variability is most likely due to variability in absorbtion, although variability in metabolism cannot be excluded. From urinary excretion data, it is possible to calculate that whole body clearance is 56 mg/kg/hr. Therefore, the dosage required to achieve an effective target tissue concentration of 4 \u03bcM is 1.73 g/kg/day (0.58 mg/kg tds) if there were complete absorbtion. However, from Moody et al . , it is clear that total urinary excretion, and hence effective bioavailability, is itself a function of dose. The oral dose required to deliver 1.73 mg/kg/day is approximately 2x the dosage calculated on the basis of whole- body clearance. Therefore the actual required dosage is on the order of 3.2 mg/kg/day. This is close to the minimum routine oral dosage used clinically in humans, eg in the treatment of chronic urinary tract infection (390 mg/day) . The maintenance oral dosage in humans is therefore approximately 225 mg/day, or 75 mg tds. Peak tissue levels are reached at approximately 1 hr and the tissue half-life is about 12 hours.</p>\n  Methylene blue exists in the charged blue oxidised form, and the uncharged colourless reduced leukomethylene blue form. We have shown experimentally in cells that the target tissue concentration in cells required to prevent tau aggregation by 50% (ie the EC50) \n\n is 4 \u03bcM for reduced methylene blue, and that it is the leuko- form which is preferentially active. It is shown by DiSanto and Wagner (1972) that approximately 78% of the methylene blue recovered in urine is in the reduced form, and from anatomical studies following iv administration, the only form which is bound to tissues is the colourless reduced form, which becomes oxidised to the blue colour on exposure to air after post-mortem dissection. The only form of methylene blue which crosses the blood-brain barrier after iv administration is the reduced form (Muller, Acta Anat 1992, 144:39- 44 and Becker and Quadbeck, 1952) . Therefore, orally absorbed methylene blue is very rapidly reduced in the body, and remains so \u2022 until excretion, possibly undergoing further chemical modification which stabilises it in a reduced form.</p>\n  It is highly likely that variability in oral absorbtion is determined largely by the efficiency of initial reduction in the GI tract. One way to achieve more reliable absorbtion is therefore be to pre-reduce methylene blue with ascorbic acid. We have shown from in vitro studies that this conversion is rather slow, so that it takes 3 hours to achieve 90% reduction of methylene blue in water in the presence of 2x mg ratio of ascorbic acid. Therefore, the dosage of methylene blue which is most likely to ensure reliable absorbtion will be 3.5mg/kg/day of methylene blue pre-reduced for at least 3 hours in the presence of 7 mg/kg/day of ascorbic acid",
    "acy of an agent in blocking, modulating or inhibiting induced conformational polymerisation of a protein, which method includes the step of minimising the diffusion coefficient of the agent.</p>\n  In a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for the prophylaxis or treatment of a condition in which induced conformational polymerisation of a protein occurs, the composition comprising a compound which is provided in, or converted into, a form in which its diffusion coefficient is minimised.</p>\n  This, and further, aspects of the invention will be better understood by reference to the following figures and experimental data, given only by way of example.</p>\n  Figures</p>\n  Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the structure of a paired helical filament (top) and the immunochemistry of neurofibrillary tangles during progression of Alzheimer's disease (bottom) .</p>\n  Figure 2 shows a conceptual scheme wherein critical nucleating factors provide a 'seed' which initiates tau capture, which then becomes autocatalytic.</p>\n  Figure 3 shows a putative pathogenic model of Alzheimer's disease. Tau aggregation is a proximal process prior to failure of axonal transport and consequent neuronal death. The tau aggregation \n\n cascade can be triggered either by a seeding/nucleation event arising from upstream changes or from primary mutations in the tau gene.</p>\n  Figure 4 shows how induction of full-length, tau can lead to its conversion into the 12 kD fragment, provided there is some preexisting 12 kD tau in the cell.</p>\n  Figure 5a-b shows a table listing proteins which play a role in diseases of protein aggregation. Also listed are the diseases themselves, the aggregating domain and/or mutation believed to be involved, and the putative (maximum) fibril subunit size. One or more literature references for each protein is given.</p>\n  Figure 6 shows a schematic illustration of the binding sites of various monoclonal antibodies to different forms of N- and C- truncated tau.</p>\n  Figure 7a-b shows the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of a human tau protein isoform. The sequence was deduced from cDNA clone htau40.</p>\n  Figure 8 shows the structures of thionine, tolonium chloride, chlorpro azine and tacrine .</p>\n  Figure 9 gives cellular assay data for diaminophenothiazines, and a structurally related anthroquinone along with apparent KI values, determined as described herein. In the Figures and Examples herein, a further parameter, B50, has been calculated to express activity in a manner directly related to the conditions of the cell-based assay, and therefore providing an indication of the tissue concentration which would be required to achieve the corresponding activity in vivo. The B50 value is the concentration of test compound used in the cell assay at which relative production of the 12 kD band from full-length tau was reduced to 50% of that observed in the absence of the compound. There is a simple linear relationship between apparent KI value and B50 value \n\n Cellular B50 = 0.0217 x KI</p>\n  In order to compare the relative usefulness of compounds as therapeutics, it may be desired to calculate an LD50 value. Where inhibitory properties are similar, preferred compounds for clinical use may be those which have the highest LD50 value. A therapeutic index (Rxlndx) may be calculated for each of compounds tested in the cell assays as follows:</p>\n  Rxlndx = LD50 / B50</p>\n  Toxicity of the compounds may be measured by cell numbers after 24 hrs exposure to the compound using a lactate dehydrogenase assay kit TOX-7 (Sigma Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions after lysis of remaining cells. Alternatively a kit from Promega UK (CytoTox 96) may be used, again according to the manufacturer' s instructions .</p>\n  Figure 10 shows the results of using reduced thionine in the present invention, based on a data set of 7 experiments. The observed cell data for production of the 12 kD band can be fitted closely (ie observed vs predicted correlation coefficient &gt; 0.9), to a standard function describing inhibition of tau-tau binding in vitro. To obtain this fit, two assumptions need to be made, which are consistent with results from other cell-based and in vitro studies :</p>\n  1) the intracellular concentration of tau is approximately 500 nM; 2) the tau-tau binding affinity is 22 nM.</p>\n  using these assumptions, the function for cellular activity predicted via standard inhibition model is:</p>\n  Activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [thionine] / KI) )</p>\n  can be solved by standard numerical methods to derive a value for apparent KI . As indicated, the value for the reduced form of \n\nthionine is 100 nM. which is essentially the same as that observed for tau-tau binding in vitro at a tau concentration of 500 nM, where the Kd value for tau-tau binding is known to be 22nM. Therefore, the activity of thionine, where the read-out is production of the 12kD truncation product from full-length tau, can be explained quantitatively on the basis of extent of inhibition of the tau-tau binding occurring through the repeat domain within the cell. This confirms that the extent of tau-tau binding determines production of the proteolytically stable core tau unit of the PHF within the cell.</p>\n  All subsequent cellular analyses of activities of other compounds are reported in the same standardised format, with the same assumptions regarding intracellular tau concentration (500 nM) and tau-tau binding affinity (22 nM) through the repeat domain.</p>\n  Figure 11 shows the results for conditions in which the reducing agents have been omitted (i.e. oxidised thionine cf. Figure 10).</p>\n  Again cellular activity is predicted via standard inhibition model:</p>\n  Activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [Ox. Thio.] / KI) )</p>\n  In this case, thionine now has an apparent KI value of 1200 nM. This confirms that the diaminophenothiazines require to be in the reduced form for activity. A similar conclusion was derived from analysis of in vitro binding data (results not shown) .</p>\n  Figure 12 shows that by using reducing or partially reducing conditions methylene blue appears much more active in the cell- based assay than predicted from in vitro studies in which the time course of the assay (1-2 hours) had not been sufficient to achieve reduction.</p>\n  Cellular activity is again predicted via standard inhibition model:</p>\n  Activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [MB] / KI)) \n\nIn the cell assay, the apparent KI value for methylene blue is 123 nM, which is within the same range as thionine and tolonium chloride. As indicated in Figure 9, the corresponding brain tissue concentration (i.e. B50 value) required to inhibit tau aggregation would be 2-3 \u03bcM.</p>\n  Figure 13 shows corresponding cell-based activity data for reduced tolonium chloride, indicating again that the predicted KI value derived from in vitro studies can be used to describe production of the 12 kD fragment from full-length tau in cells.</p>\n  Cellular activity is predicted via standard inhibition model:</p>\n  Activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [TC] / KI) )</p>\n  This provides further confirmation of the validity of the mathematical analysis procedure used.</p>\n  Figure 14 shows that DH12 (anthroquinone) which is structurally related to the diaminophenothiazines is inactive in the conditions of the assay.</p>\n  Figures 15 &amp; 16 show similar analyses to those given above in Figures 9-14, but for chlorpromazine and tacrine respectively. Using the same assumptions (tau concentration 415 nM, and tau-tau binding Kd 22 nM) , and cellular activity predicted via standard inhibition model:</p>\n  Activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [cpz] / KI) )</p>\n  the apparent KI values for chlorpromazine and tacrine (2117 nM and 802 nM respectively) are greater than anticipated from the in vitro studies .</p>\n  Figure 17 shows the extent of reduction of various compounds in the presence of DTT.</p>\n  Figure 18 shows the percentage reduction of MB plotted against the \n\nratio of MB:Vitamin C.</p>\n  Figure 19(a) shows that by assuming a target tissue concentration of 4\u03bcM (i.e. 1.5 \u03bcg/g) it is possible to determine from the data of DiSanto and Wagner (1972) that tissue concentrations of this order would be achieved at an IV dosage of 0.11 mg/kg.</p>\n  Figure 19(b) shows a model for the distribution of MB following a single 100 mg dose in a 70 kg subject, assuming instantaneous absorbtion.</p>\n  Figure 20 summarises the results for the transient expression of tau fragments in 3T3 and COS-7 cells based upon data from both microscopical and biochemical experiments.</p>\n  Expression of recombinant tau fragments in eukaryotic cells was performed as follows. Eight tau constructs, transiently expressed in 3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were examined by immunocytochemistry and immunoblots. The extent of expression in each cell type was given semi-quantitatively on the basis of both sets of results: -, no detectable expression; +, very weak immunoreactivity; + to ++++, increasing levels of positive immunoreactivity. In all cases, mAb 7.51 was used with each construct to obtain the results. In addition the specificity was confirmed for each construct by using a panel of antibodies against different domains of tau protein (mAbs 499, T14, Taul, 342, 7.51, 423 and T46) . Kozak sequences were absent in the first six contructs, but were present in the cDNA constructs 7 and 8.</p>\n  Figure 21 illustrates the inducible expression of full-length human tau in 3T6 fibroblasts in two cell lines. T40.22 shows low level background leakage of full length tau in the uninduced state (\"U\"), and high levels of expression after addition of IPTG (i.e. induced, \"I\"). T40.37 shows the same, but lower levels of expression without induction.</p>\n  Figure 22 shows a result of a triple vector system. A vector permitting very low level constitutive expression of the 12 kD \n\n fragment was introduced into cells lines in which inducible expression of full length tau had already been achieved (in fact cell line T40.22 shown in Figure 21 above). Low levels of IPTG are introduced to induce expression of full-length tau. At 0 \u03bcM IPTG, there is very low level expression of the 12 kD band, and low \"background leakage\" expression of full-length tau. As progressively more full-length tau is induced by introducing higher levels of IPTG, more of the full-length tau is converted to the 12 kD species.</p>\n  Figure 23 shows the inhibitory effects of reduced thionine. In each set of lanes, there is inducible production of the 12 kD band in the presence of increasing concentrations of IPTG inducing higher levels of T40. As the thionine concentration is increased, the production of the 12 kD band from T40 is suppressed.</p>\n  Figure 24 shows quantitatively the results of Figure 23. In the absence of thionine, induction of T40 at increasing concentrations of IPTG leads to a corresponding increased production of the 12 kD 'fragment. In the presence of 2 \u03bcM thionine, there is still induction of T40, but it is not converted into the 12 kD fragment.</p>\n  Figure 25 shows comparative in vitro KI values for various compounds, in nM. The KI values relate to the particular assay conditions used (500:1 DTT: compound, 120 minutes - see Figure 17).</p>\n  Figures 26 and 27 show the inhibitory effect on tau-tau binding of phenothiazines having 0, 2, 3 or 0, 4, 6 methyl groups, respectively.</p>\n  Figure 28 shows the derivation of two parameters useful for measuring the inhibition of tau-tau association by test compounds. STB is the standardised binding relative to that seen in the absence of compound, taken as the mean observed at 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml. As described in WO 96/30766, an STB value of 1.0 represents binding equivalent to that observed in the absence of compound, whereas a value of 0.2 indicates that the binding was reduced to a mean of 20% at test compound concentrations of 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml. LB50 is log \n\n10 molar ratio of compound: tau producing 50% tau-tau binding compared with that seen in the absence of compound (B50) .</p>\n  Figure 29 shows the relationship between STB and LB50 parameters. STB can be shown to be a linear function of the LB50.</p>\n  STB is a logarithmic function of the molar ratio of compound: tau at which tau-tau binding is reduced by 50%.</p>\n  LB50 is the log of the molar ratio of compound with respect to tau at which tau-tau binding is 50% of that observed in the absence of compound</p>\n  LB50 = 0.05 + (2.65 x STB) r=0.95</p>\n  The determination of in vitro B50 requires that there be some degree of inhibition of tau-tau binding, and a 50% value is obtained by extrapolation. Determination of STB requires no such extrapolation procedure.</p>\n  Figure 30 shows compounds for which both STB and B50 values have been determined. Assuming that the total tau concentration in cells is approximately 500 nM (i.e. the concentration of tau used in the assay) , the B50 values provide an approximation in the in vitro assay to the concentration (i.e. [500 x B50] nM) at which the activity might be expected in cell systems.</p>\n  Figure 31 shows the formal relationship between the in vitro LB50 value and the log KI value for the diaminophenothiazine series.</p>\n  Figure 32 shows the relationship between the number of methyl groups in a diaminophenothiazine (NMETH) and the redox potential (E) and diffusion coefficient (DIF) . Italicised figures indicate correlation coefficients (R) and p values after exclusion of MB.</p>\n  Figure 33 shows the relationship between the percentage of compound that is reduced, as determined experimentally, and the known reduction potential of the compound. The reduction potential \n\npredicts the observed extent of reduction of the diaminophenothiazines .</p>\n  Figure 34a shows that there is no clear relationship between inhibitory potency and the extent of reduction of compounds .</p>\n  Figure 34b shows that inhibitory potency is not determined simply by reduction potential.</p>\n  Figure 35 shows that the inhibitory potency can be related directly to the diffusion coefficient (which is a measure of the tendency of the reduced form to stack and aggregate) .</p>\n  Figures 36 and 37 show the predicted relationships between estimated LB50 (\"ESTLB50\") and STB (\"ESTSTB\") values, respectively, and reduction potential and diffusion coefficient, in which the diffusion coefficient is given the greater weighting.</p>\n  Figure 38 shows the crystalline structure of Methylene Blue.</p>\n  Figure 39 shows tau-tau binding in the presence of ImM DTT, as measured in the solid phase assay of WO 96/30766. Two different antibodies were used to detect tau-tau binding, namely mAb 342 (top) and 499 (bottom) . The vertical axis represents tau-tau binding, the horizontal axis shows the concentration of full-length tau in the aqueous phase, and the key shows varying concentrations of solid-phase tau. As can be seen, tau-tau binding still occurs in the presence of DTT.</p>\n  Figure 40 shows various species of tau fragments and doublets which are present without induction (\"U\") and following induction (\"I\") in a cell line of the present invention. These include species with mobilities equivalent to 12/14 kD, -25/27 kD, -30/32 kD, -36/38 kD and -42/44 kD (see Example 3) .</p>\n  Figure 41(a) shows how the 12 kD fragment arises via template- induced proteolytic processing of full-length tau molecules at the approximate positions shown by the arrow-heads . \n\nFigure 41 (b) shows how the 25/27 kD species arises via template- induced proteolytic processing of full-length tau molecules at the approximate positions shown by the arrow-heads.</p>\n  Figure 42 shows a plot of the apparent gel mobilities of the species of Figures 40-41 and their lengths in amino-acid residues.</p>\n  Figure 43 shows the fragments of Figures 40-42 are at intervals of either -34 residues or -17 residues which is the equivalent of a single tau repeat, or half of it. All of the fragments may be generated from a basic heptameric aggregate as a simple set of proteolytic cleavages occurring at the positions indicated by the arrowheads .</p>\n  Figure 44 shows these same fragments in descending order of length and increasing gel mobility.</p>\n  Figure 45 shows that DMMB is surprisingly potent in the cell model. Its inhibitory activity could be seen both in the absence of IPTG induction and following induction (see Example 4) .</p>\n  Figure 46 shows the activity of DMMB on base-line expression of the 12/14 kD species, using the same set of assumptions regarding intracellular tau concentration and in vitro tau-tau binding affinity used in Figs 10 - 16.</p>\n  Cellular activity is predicted via standard inhibition model:</p>\n  activity = [tau] / ([tau] Kd* (1 + [DMMB] / Ki) )</p>\n  DMMB has an apparent KI within the cell of 4 . 4 nM, and the cellular B50 value is -100 nM .</p>\n  Examples</p>\n  General materials and methods \n\nProduction of 3T6H cell lines</p>\n  3T6 cells were ECACC No: 86120801 Mouse Swiss Albino Embryo Fibroblasts .</p>\n  For the inducible system, the experiments employed Lac Switch\u2122 from Stratagene using the p3'SS vector to express the Lac repressor protein and pOPRSVICAT to express the full-length tau under the control of the Lac repressor. Expression is induced by the addition of IPTG.</p>\n  Initially 3T6 cells were transfected, by electroporation, with the p3'SS plasmid and colonies selected by hygromycin resistance. 5 clones that were expressing varying levels of the Lac repressor protein (determined by immunocytochemistry) were picked, and also the non-cloned cells were retained for comparison.</p>\n  Production of pOPRSVT40 vector</p>\n  The T40 insert for cloning into the pOPRSVICAT vector was prepared by PCR with Vent polymerase (NEB) using primers (shown below) that included a Not I site and a start or stop codon as appropriate. The PCR product and pOPRSVICAT vector were cut with Not I and purified. The vector was dephosphorylated to prevent re-ligation, and the insert ligated into the vector using standard protocols.</p>\n  The resulting ligation mix was transfected into competent E. coli cells and the cells plated out on amp plates. Colonies were picked and gridded out on a new amp plate. Colony lifts were taken to Hybond-N 0.45\u03bcm nylon membrane (A",

M.-Y. et al.(1991)</p>\n  Science 251: 675).</p>\n  Tau Binding Assay</p>\n  This was carried out basically as described in Wischik, C M., et al.(1996) Proc . Natl . Acad. Sci . USA 93:11213. Solid phase tau (0- 20 \u03bcg/ml) was coated on 96-well poly (vinyl chloride) microtitre plates in 50 mM carbonate buffer at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The plate was washed twice with 0.05% Tween 20, then blocked with 2% Marvel in PBST for 1 h at 37\u00b0C After washing again, the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with aqueous phase tau (0 - 300 \u03bcg/ml in PBST containing 1% gelatin) . In the present application, ImM DTT was also added.</p>\n  The plate was washed twice and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with mAb 499 or 342, diluted with an equal volume of 2% Marvel in PBST. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1/1000 in PBST) was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C The plate was washed and incubated with substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine and H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and the rate of change of absorbance measured using a V<sub>max</sub> plate reader (Molecular Diagnostics, California) as described previously (Harrington, C.

Each experiment was performed in triplicate and included controls in which both solid phase and aqueous phase tau were absent, and also with either one of the two absent . \n\nData Analysis</p>\n  This was performed as described in Wischik et al . { supra ) and curves were fitted according to the Langmuir equation with the</p>\n  Kaleidagraph (Synergy, Philadelph",
    "ule assembly properties of tau (G272V, V337M, P301 S, R406W) and S305N, which affects the alternative splicing of the tau gene in vivo . In general, cells expressing full-length tau carrying mutations exhibited labelling of the microtubular network and was indistinguishable from cells transfected with wild-type tau. Cell lines expressing certain truncated tau fragments including mutations proved unstable.</p>\n  Concl usion</p>\n  In summary, the constitutive expression of truncated tau within eukaryotic cells proved difficult to achieve. Although transient transfection systems permitted the optimisation of expression of tau by manipulating the Kozak consensus surrounding the initiation codon for 297-tau, the expression of e.g. 297-391 was still modest, \n\nsuggesting some inherent toxic properties of the fragment. Stable transfections reiterated this conclusion. This latter system demonstrated that truncation at either N- or C-termini resulted in a slightly greater propensity for the tau to assemble in amorphous deposits rather than in a microtubular network. Stable expression of combinations of tau fragments also generated aggregates within the cytoplasm of cells, but this system was not readily reproducible .</p>\n  Example 2 - inducible expression of truncated tau</p>\n  In a further attempt to create a stable, reproducible system, without the toxicity associated with constitutive expression, inducible expression of the core-tau fragment of the PHF (i.e. 297- 391 - which is 12 kD) was attempted.</p>\n  Several inducible systems for expression of proteins in eukaryotic cells were tried, although the preferred system was the \"lac switch\" system. In this system, two vectors are incorporated into cells, typically 3T3 or 3T6 fibroblasts which do not express any endogenous tau protein. The first, the p3'SS vector codes for constitutive expression of the lac I gene, and expressors are selected on the basis of hygromycin resistance. The second, pOPRSVICAT incorporates the DNA coding for the tau protein fragment under the control of a strong RSV promoter which contains operator sequences from the Lac operon. Cells which incorporate this vector are selected on the basis of neomycin resistance. Cells which have incorporated both vectors have the property that constitutive expression of lac I prevents expression of the incorporated protein (i.e. tau ) controlled by the Lac operon. The addition of the sugar IPTG competes for the binding of lac I to the Lac operon, and so permits expression of tau protein.</p>\n  Inducible expression of the 12 kD fragment was carried out in two cell lines. These did not show appreciable levels of tau protein expression until after 3 days treatment with IPTG at which stage high levels of 12 kD suddenly appeared, forming intracellular aggregates which promptly killed the cell. The process of \n\naggregation was, as expected, non-linear progressing from low level expression to sudden accumulation of toxic aggregates without any clear gradation, making the aggregation and toxicity impossible to control. This non-linear progression prevented a proper control of the system.</p>\n  Example 3 - expression of tau in stable cell lines according to invention</p>\n  In view of the results above, a further system was used as follows. Tissue culture cell line DH 19.4.1.4 and clones thereof were based on 3T6 cells (ECACC No: 86120801 Mouse Swiss Albino Embryo Fibroblasts) expressing full-length, four repeat human tau under the control of an inducible promoter and truncated human tau (295- 391) under the control of a constitutive promoter.</p>\n  Cells expressing T40 under the control of an inducible promoter, T40.22.10, were transfected (by lipofection) with the pZeo295-391 plasmid. Positive cells were selected for by resistance to zeocin at 400\u03bcg/ml. Expression of truncated tau on a background of inducible expression of full-length tau was confirmed by Western blot analysis with Mab 7.51.</p>\n  Figure 21 illustrates the inducible expression of full-length human tau only in 3T6 fibroblasts in two cell lines. T40.22 shows low level background leakage of full length tau in the uninduced state (\"U\"), and high levels of expression after addition of IPTG (i.e. induced, \"I\"). T40.37 shows the same, but lower levels of expression without induction. Figure 22 shows the results of a triple vector system. A vector permitting very low level constitutive expression of the 12 kD fragment was introduced into cell lines in which inducible expression of full length tau had already been achieved (T40.22 shown in Figure 21) . Figure 22 shows what happens when low levels of IPTG are introduced to induce expression of full-length tau. At 0 \u03bcM IPTG, there is very low level expression of the 12 kD band, and low \"background leakage\" expression of full-length tau. As progressively more full-length tau is induced by introducing higher levels of IPTG, more of the \n\nfull-length tau is converted to the 12 kD species, and more of the intermediate higher molecular weight fragments (described in more detail in Figs 43 and 44) are produced.</p>\n  Examination of the original T40-inducible cell line (T40.22.10) which did not contain the vector for constitutive expression of the 12 kD fragment shows that the 12 kD species is not produced as a truncation by-product of full-length tau induction. Enhanced expression of the 12 kD band following induction of T40 was seen only in cells with low level prior expression of the 12 kD fragment (DH19.4.1. .6) . That is, pre-existing 12 kD provides a template for production of more 12 kD following the induction of full-length tau. An additional doublet may also appear with apparent gel mobility of -25/27 kD when the cells are in the uninduced state (e.g. in the cell line designated DH 19.4.1. A.B2) . Following induction with IPTG, a further series of doublets may appear, with gel mobilities -30/32 kD, -36/38 kD and -42/44 kD.</p>\n  These species are shown in Figure 40 both without induction (\"U\") and following induction (\"I\") . Also shown are the patterns of immunoreactivity of these fragments seen with mAb 342 and a C- terminal polyclonal antibody T46 which recognises epitopes located between residues Ser422 and Leu441.</p>\n  The derivation of the fragments seen in the uninduced state (i.e. 12/14 kD and 25/27 kD) may be explained by reference to Figure 41.</p>\n  Figure 41 (a) shows how the 12 kD fragment arises via template- induced proteolytic processing of full-length tau molecules at the approximate positions shown by the arrow-heads.</p>\n  In the case of the 25/27 kD species, these fragments cannot represent dimers of the the 12/14 kD species, as these fragments are immunoreactive with T46. Therefore, a further proteolytic product of the full-length aggregating tau protein must arise via cleavages occurring at the approximate positions shown by the arrowheads in Figure 41(b). \n\nFollowing induction (Figure 40, I), the further series of doublets is seen. The derivation of these further fragments can be better understood with reference to Figures 42-44.</p>\n  Figure 42 shows a plot of the apparent gel mobilities of these fragments and their lengths in amino-acid residues, indicating that the apparent gel mobilities can be understood in terms of a characteristic set of fragment lengths.</p>\n  As illustrated in Figure 43, all of these fragments are at intervals of either -34 residues or -17 residues which is the equivalent of a single tau repeat, or half of it. All of the fragments generated can therefore be understood as arising from a simple set of proteolytic cleavages occurring at the positions indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 43 from a basic heptameric aggregate, formed as shown in the figure. In this scheme the fragments arise as the full combinatorial set of the proposed cleavages occurring at the 3 possible approximate positions shown by the arrowheads at either end of the aggregate. The corresponding predicted immunoreactivity patterns seen with mAb 342 and T46 associated with these fragments are also tabulated.</p>\n  Figure 44 shows these same fragments in descending order of length and increasing gel mobility. Although the heptameric aggregate is shown for convenience as arising entirely from full-length tau molecules, it will be appreciated that the 12/14 kD fragment could be interposed within the proposed aggregate, replacing some of the binding partners, and that the precise pattern of inclusion of these short fragments in the aggregate will determine which precise fragments from the full set predominate in a given instance.</p>\n  Therefore, the production of this family of proteolytic fragments is better understood as a possible repertoire which can be instantiated in various ways within the cell.</p>\n  Example 4 - inhibitory effects of compounds on production of proteolytic fragment</p>\n  Having achieved a stable cell system in which production of the 12 \n\nkD fragment (and others) could be controlled, the model was used to test the inhibitory effects of reduced thionine. This is shown in Figure 23. In each set of lanes, there is inducible production of the 12 kD band in the presence of increasing concentrations of IPTG inducing higher levels of T40. As the thionine concentration is increased, the production of the 12 kD band from T40 is suppressed. This is shown quantitatively in Figure 24. In the absence of thionine, induction of T40 at increasing concentrations of IPTG leads to a corresponding increased production of the 12 kD fragment. In the presence of 2 \u03bcM thionine, there is still induction of T40, but it is not converted into to the 12 kD fragment .</p>\n  As reduced thionine is itself toxic, it is necessary to control for reduction in the levels of T40 induced by corresponding does of</p>\n  IPTG at higher levels of thionine. This can be achieved by determining the ratio of 12 kD : T40, which permits averaging the data across IPTG levels and shows a dose-dependent reduction in the level of the 12 kD relative to full-length tau.</p>\n  The activities of various compounds in the T40/12 kD assay are shown in Figures 9 to 16.</p>\n  Results are expressed in terms of the ratio of 12 kD : T40 following induction of full-length tau (T40) by treatment cells with IPTG (0, 10, 25, 50 \u03bcM) in the presence of thionine or tolonium chloride introduced at the concentrations shown in the presence of reducing agents (200 \u03bcM DTT/ascorbate) , or chlorpromazine or tacrine introduced without reducing agents . As can be seen, thionine and tolonium chloride produce essentially identical inhibition, whereas chlorpromazine and tacrine are non- inhibitory in the same concentration range. The effect of the reducing agents alone was tested in control experiments which showed no significant difference was seen in the 12 kD : T40 ratio , in the presence of reducing agents alone.</p>\n  The properties of the cell line producing higher molecular weight \n\ndegradation products were also examined with MB and DMMB (dimethyl- methylene blue) .</p>\n  As can be seen in Figure 45, DMMB proved to be surprisingly potent in the cell model. Its inhibitory activity could be seen both in the absence of IPTG induction and following induction. Treatment with 1 \u03bcM DMMB effectively abolished all degradation products within the cell . Further experience with MB and DMMB has shown that even apparent base-line production of the 12/14 kD species is largely determined by aggregation. That is, the constitutive production of the 295-391 fragment is itself either below the level of detection by immunoblot or else it is stabilised by spontaneous aggregation so as to reach levels within the cell which can be detected by immunoblot.- Alternatively, the apparent base-line levels of the 12/14 kD fragment seen without IPTG induction and in the absence of treatment with a tau-aggregation inhibitor may itself be dominated by templated aggregation-dependent production from the leakage levels of T40 produced in absence of induction. Whatever the combination of factors which determines the levels of the 12/14 kD fragment in the base-line condition, its apparent expression can be essentially eliminated, along with higher molecular weight aggregation products, by a potent aggregation inhibitor such as DMMB. These results further confirm that production of the higher molecular weight proteolytic fragments (ie 30/32, 36/38, 42/44 kD) is also dependent on critical tau-tau binding interactions occurring through the repeat domain, as shown in Figures 41, 43 and 44.</p>\n  Figure 46 shows the activity of DMMB on base-line expression of the 12/14 kD species, using the same set of assumptions regarding intracellular tau concentration and in vitro tau-tau binding affinity used in Figs 10 - 16. In this case DMMB is found to have an apparent KI within the cell of 4.4 nM, and the cellular B50 value is -100 nM. This indicates that DMMB is highly potent within the cellular milieu.</p>\n  Example 5 - comparison of inhibitory effects of reduced and oxidised compounds \n\nThe mathematical model used for the in vitro data was used to analyse the effects of test substances in the T40 : 12kD cell assay. Using the known values for Kd and KI from in vitro data, the expression indicated was used to solve for the intracellular concentration of full-length tau (see e.g. Figure 10).</p>\n  This was found to be about 500 nM, which is in the range expected from studies of tau in brain and in cell systems. A good fit to the experimental data was obtained implying that for some compounds the inhibition of production of truncated tau within the cell can be predicted from the approximate Kd and KI values determined experimentally in vitro.</p>\n  Example 6 - examination of inhibitory properties of diaminophenothiazines</p>\n  In in vitro studies, the most active inhibitors of tau-tau binding identified were the reduced forms of diaminophenothiazines having 0, 2 or 3 methyl groups. Figure 25 shows the reduced forms of such compounds . The corresponding tau-tau binding curves are shown as a function of molar ratio with respect to tau in Figures 26 and 27. As shown, compounds of the \"desmethyl series\" (0, 2 or 3 methyl groups) produce approximately 50% inhibition of tau-tau binding (shown on the vertical axis) at molar ratios of 3:1 - 4:1 of compound: tau 'AMR' shown on log scale on horizontal axis) . The mean molar ratio for 50% inhibition of tau-tau binding for this group of compounds is 4:1.</p>\n  Diaminophenothiazines having 4 or 6 methyl groups (the \"methylated group\") have a biphasic action, with enhancement of tau-tau binding at lower concentration, and inhibition of tau-tau binding at high concentrations (Figure 27) . These compounds thus require much higher molar ratios to effect 50% inhibition of tau-tau binding.</p>\n  Examination of other features of the diaminophenothiazine compound was also carried out. Substitution of the heterocyclic nitrogen or sulphur atoms was found to severely interfere with inhibitory \n\npotency of the compounds. Likewise, removal of the diamino groups was found to be detrimental to the inhibitory activity. It thus appeared that the di"
