The apparent KI value for methylene blue is 123 nM, which is within the same range as thionine and tolonium chloride.\n3. The apparent KI values for chlorpromazine and tacrine (2117 nM and 802 nM respectively) are greater than anticipated from the in vitro studies.\n4. DMMB has an apparent KI within the cell of 4.4 nM, and the cellular B50 value is -100 nM.\n5. The tau-tau binding affinity is 22 nM.\n6. The value for the reduced form of thionine is 100 nM.\n7. The corresponding brain tissue concentration (i.e. B50 value) required to inhibit tau aggregation would be 2-3 \u03bcM.\n8. Assuming that the total tau concentration in cells is approximately 500 nM (i.e. the concentration of tau used in the assay), the B50 values provide an approximation in the in vitro assay to the concentration (i.e. [500 x B50] nM) at which the activity might be expected in cell systems."}
