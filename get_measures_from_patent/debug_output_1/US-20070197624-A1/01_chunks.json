    "nd future public health problem. The disease is currently estimated to affect about two to three million individuals in the United States alone. AD is at present incurable. No treatment that effectively prevents AD or reverses its symptoms and course is currently known. </p> The brains of individuals with AD exhibit characteristic lesions termed senile (or amyloid) plaques, amyloid angiopathy (amyloid deposits in blood vessels) and neurofibrillary tangles. Large numbers of these lesions, particularly amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are generally found in several areas of the human brain important for memory and cognitive function in patients with AD. Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restrictive anatomical distribution are also found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) and Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch Type (HCHWA-D). At present, a definitive diagnosis of AD usually requires observing the aforementioned lesions in the brain tissue of patients who have died with the disease or, rarely, in small biopsied samples of brain tissue taken during an invasive neurosurgical procedure. </p> The principal chemical constituent of the amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits (amyloid angiopathy) characteristic of AD and the other disorders mentioned above is an approximately 4.2 kilodalton (kD) protein of about 39-43 amino acids designated the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (\u03b2AP) or sometimes A\u03b2, A\u03b2P or \u03b2/A4. \u03b2-Amyloid peptide was first purified and a partial amino acid sequence was provided by Glenner, et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 120: 885-890) 1984)). \u03b2-amyloid peptide is a small fragment of a much larger precursor protein (APP), normally produced by cells in tissues of various animals. </p> A\u03b2 is derived from cleavage of APP by protease systems, collectively termed secretases. APP is first cleaved by \u03b2 secretase to yield a \u03b2 stub, which is then cleaved by \u03b3 secretase to yield a \u03b2-amyloid fragment that is secreted. \u03b2 secretase generates the N-terminus of A\u03b2. \u03b3 secretase generates C-terminal fragments ending at position 38, 39, 40, 42, and 43 or generating C-terminal extended precursors that are subsequently truncated to the above polypeptides. </p> U.S. Pat.

Its 43-amino acid sequence is disclosed in U.S. Pat.
