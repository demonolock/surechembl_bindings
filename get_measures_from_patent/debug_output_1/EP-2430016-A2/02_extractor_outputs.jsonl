{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nWe have validated the CBF\u03b2-SMMHC - Runt domain assay by determining the K<sub>d</sub> for binding using serial dilution resulting in a Kd value of 15 nM, in good agreement with the Kd value of 6 nM obtained from calorimetric measurements of the binding of unmodified Runt domain to unmodified CBF\u03b2-SMMHC (Lukasik, Zhang et al. 2002).\nThe TR-FRET assay was validated by running the titration experiment with unlabeled CBF\u03b2-SMMHC protein which was competing with Venus-CBF\u03b2-SMMHC for binding to the Runt domain. This resulted in an IC50 value of 200 nM, in good agreement with the value obtained by FRET (IC50 = 47 nM; the difference results from the 3 -fold higher protein concentration used in TR-FRET in order to obtain an adequate dynamic range for the TR-FRET assay)."}
