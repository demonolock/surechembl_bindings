Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and utilize the compounds of the present invention. Therefore, the examples should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teaching provided herein. Examples</p>FRET assay. We have developed effective assays to monitor the inhibition of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC binding to the Runt domain (as well as for CBF\u03b2 binding to the Runt domain). We fused the green fluorescent protein derivative Cerulean to the N-terminus of the Runt domain and the green fluorescent protein derivative Venus to the N- terminus of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC (as well as to CBF\u03b2 (Gorczynski, Grembecka et al. 2007)).</p>The ratio of the emission intensities at 525 nm and 474 nm, measured after excitation at 433 nm, was used as the readout in this assay. The dynamic range for the FRET assay was determined by adding a 30-fold excess of untagged CBF\u03b2-SMMHC (or CBF\u03b2 in the case of CBF\u03b2 - Runt domain binding) to the assay and the associated change in the FRET ratio was defined as 100% inhibition. We have validated the CBF\u03b2-SMMHC - Runt domain assay by determining the K<sub>d</sub> for binding using serial dilution resulting in a \n\n Kd value of 15 nM, in good agreement with the Kd value of 6 nM obtained from calorimetric measurements of the binding of unmodified Runt domain to unmodified CBF\u03b2-SMMHC (Lukasik, Zhang et al. 2002).</p>TR-FRET assay. It is essential to have a secondary assay to rule out false positives resulting from interference with the primary assays we conduct. To that end, we have also developed a TR-FRET (Time Resolved FRET) assay for these interactions. Due to time resolved detection, this approach has the distinct advantage of being substantially less sensitive to auto fluorescence of small molecules and is therefore quite effective at identifying false positives arising from such effects (Bazin, Preaudat et al. 2001; Imbert, Unterreiner et al. 2007). We are using His-tagged Runt domain, a Tb- labeled anti-his tag antibody (donor), and Venus-CBF\u03b2-SMMHC (acceptor) for the TR- FRET assay. Excitation is performed at 337 nm (Tb) and the emission is read out at 490 nm (Tb) and 520 nm (Venus-CBF\u03b2-SMMC). Binding of the two proteins results in an increase in the 520/490 emission ratio whereas disruption of this interaction results in a decrease in the 520/490 emission ratio. Because of the long lifetime of the Tb fluorescence, acquisition of the emission signal can be delayed by several hundred microseconds after excitation, resulting in the substantial decay of fluorescence derived from small molecules. This will eliminate much of the fluorescent interference from small molecules, thus identifying false positives arising from such fluorescence effects. The TR-FRET assay was validated by running the titration experiment with unlabeled CBF\u03b2-SMMHC protein which was competing with Venus-CBF\u03b2-SMMHC for binding to the Runt domain. This resulted in an IC50 value of 200 nM, in good agreement with the value obtained by FRET (IC50 = 47 nM; the difference results from the 3 -fold higher protein concentration used in TR-FRET in order to obtain an adequate dynamic range for the TR-FRET assay).</p>Controls for promiscuous inhibition by micelle formation or covalent binding. As shown by Shoichet and co-workers (Seidler, McGovern et al. 2003), a primary source of false positives in any screen is micelle formation. In order to test for this, all active compounds are screened a second time by FRET in the presence of Triton detergent (Feng and Shoichet 2006). A substantial loss of activity in the presence of detergent is a hallmark of inhibition by micelle formation and such compounds are thus \n\n identified as false positives. In addition, we are also incubating compound with protein and checking by mass spectroscopy to ensure that positive hits are not acting by covalent addition to either of the proteins.</p>NMR spectroscopy for validation of lead compounds. Validation of binding of a small molecule inhibitor to its protein target is an essential step in developing potent inhibitors. This can be readily achieved using either NMR spectroscopy or X-ray cr<sub>^</sub> itallography. In the case of X-ray crystallography, this is achieved by co- crystallization of the protein with the ligand and determination of the structure. In the case of NMR spectroscopy, the structure of a compound-protein complex can also be determined. In addition, chemical shift perturbations of the protein NMR spectrum</p>(typically 2",
    "fective for inv(16) leukemia. In CML, imatinib inhibits the activity of BCR-ABL as well as the remaining wildtype ABL present in cells, yet the leukemia cells are effectively eliminated because of the addiction of these cells to BCR-ABL. Based on this analogy, it is plausible that small molecule inhibitors targeting CBF\u03b2, thereby affecting both CBF\u03b2-SMMHC as well as wildtype CBF\u03b2, may be effective and are worth pursuing.</p>However, a recent study where the dosage of CBF\u03b2 was reduced in the presence of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC in a mouse model showed enhanced leukemogenesis, suggesting that inhibition of both CBF\u03b2 and CBF\u03b2-SMMHC may not be effective. Therefore, it is also important to develop inhibitors that can selectively inhibit CBF\u03b2-SMMHC with minimal effects on CBF\u03b2. In order to achieve this, we are proposing to take advantage of the oligomeric nature of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and apply the principles of poly -valency (Mammen, Choi et al. 1998; Kiessling, Gestwicki et al. 2006) to achieve the desired selectivity. Consistent with existing literature on myosin, we have shown that truncated forms of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC lacking the extreme C-terminus form dimers in solution</p>(Lukasik, Zhang et al. 2002). For the full-length protein, these dimers then oligomerize to form high order oligomers (Shigesada, van de Sluis et al. 2004). In contrast, CBF\u03b2 is monomeric in solution. This difference in oligomerization provides a means to achieve selective inhibition of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC versus CBF\u03b2. As shown in Figure 5, the dissociation constant for a monovalent compound binding to monomeric CBF\u03b2 is equal to K<sub>d</sub>(monomer). If we create a homo-dimer of this compound, it will bind the monomeric CBF\u03b2 protein with a dissociation constant equal to K<sub>d</sub>(monomer)/2. However, this same homo-dimer will interact with two sites on the dimeric CBF\u03b2-SMMHC protein and have a Kd(dimer) equal to (Kd(monomer)) /C<sub>e</sub>ff where C<sub>e</sub>ff is the effective concentration resulting from the tethering of the two binding sites on CBF\u03b2-SMMHC to one another (Mulder, Auletta et al. 2004). Recent analysis of the dependence of C<sub>eff</sub> values in proteins based on the intervening length of flexible peptide make it possible to accurately estimate C<sub>e</sub>ff values (Goldenberg 2003). We have assigned the NMR resonances of a CBF\u03b2-SMMHC construct and measured hetero nuclear NOE to establish the length of the flexible region between CBF\u03b2 and the myosin coiled coil. Our knowledge of the linker length between \n\n the CBF\u03b2 and myosin coiled coil makes it possible to estimate C<sub>e</sub>ff, resulting in a predicted value of 6-40* 10<sup>\"</sup> M (there are two different models for C<sub>e</sub>ff calculations and most experimental values fall between these two models). Thus, a monomer with a K<sub>d</sub> of 10 \u03bcM, when appropriately tethered, will yield an inhibitor with a predicted Kd as low as 2.5-17 nM, neglecting entropic losses necessary for binding. This corresponds to -1000-fold selectivity for CBF\u03b2-SMMHC. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is hypothesized herein that the creation of homo-dimers of CBF\u03b2 inhibitors will provide a means to achieve selectivity for CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and thereby provide a mechanism to selectively inhibit CBF\u03b2-SMMHC activity while minimally affecting CBF\u03b2.</p>Synthesis ofdimeric compounds. We are exploring linking of benzimidazole inhibitors via the pyridine ring with attachment at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the pyridine ring. As shown in Figure 6, we have developed an efficient approach to generate linked compounds through the 5 position. A series of differing length polyethylene glycol linkers have been incorporated (7, 10, 16 atoms). Testing of various linker lengths has shown the 7 atom linked compound to be the most potent so subsequent studies have focused on this compound (named AI-4-62 or AI-4-83 below).</p></p>Effects ofdimeric compounds on ME-I cells (an inv(16) cell line). The dimer with a 7 atom linker (AI-4-62) has been tested for effects on the growth of the ME-I cell line (see Figure 7), a leukemia cell line with the inv(16). In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the dimer relative to the parent monomeric inhibitor, we have tested both on ME-I cells. Strikingly, the dimeric compound is substantially (~15-fold) more \n\n potent than the corresponding monomer, indicating a substantial impro"
