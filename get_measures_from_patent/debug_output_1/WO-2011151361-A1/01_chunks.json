    "o-factor which activates the apo-protein, aequorin. The protein has three high affinity binding sites for calcium. Upon agonism of the mGluR5 receptor, binding of calcium to the aequorin protein induces a conformational change resulting in an oxidative decarboxylation reaction producing coelenteramide and a flash luminescence signal. This signal was measured using the Lumilux (supplied by Perkin Elmer). </p>Compound Preparation </p> The test compounds were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 3mM. These solutions are serially diluted with DMSO to 1 in 4 using a Biomek FX liquid handling device (supplied by Beckman Coulter) in a 384-well compound plate (supplied by Greiner). Daughter plates of 0.5\u03bc\u0399\u039b/\u03bd\u03b2\u0399\u0399 were stamped-out from this master plate for use in the assay. \n\n Glutamate Dose Response Curve Preparation </p> A 100mM solution of glutamic acid was prepared in water. This was further diluted with DMSO to a concentration of 10mM. 16 x 1 1 point concentration response curves (CRC) were prepared in DMSO, making the final assay concentration 1.66 x10<sup>\"</sup>^M, with 1 in 3 serial dilutions using the Biomek FX. 0.5\u03bc\u0399 stamp-outs of this plate were generated for use in the assay. </p>Estimation of EC80 concentration of Glutamate </p>The glutamate CRC plate was placed on the Lumilux where 20\u03bc\u0399\u039b/\u03bd\u03b2\u0399\u0399 of dilution buffer was added, followed by 10\u03bc\u0399/well of loaded cell suspension and a </p>luminescence read was made. An EC80 concentration of glutamate was calculated by using 4X EC50 generated. The EC80 solution was prepared in dilution buffer and added to a reservoir within the Lumilux. </p>Running the Assay </p> 20\u03bc\u0399\u039b/\u03bd\u03b2\u0399\u0399 of buffer and 10\u03bc\u0399/well of cell suspension were added to the test compounds using the lumilux. These plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 mins, 10\u03bc\u0399/well of EC80 solution added and a luminescence read made. Blocking of the receptor by test compound in a dose dependent manner was evident from the luminescence vs time profiles generated for each well. The data was analysed using XC50 software to produce CRCs, from which the potency and plC50 can be determined. When tested in this assay, supporting compounds 1 -20, 22-39, 42-54 gave a plC50 of 6.5 to 9.1. Supporting compound 37 gave a plC50 of 9.1. Supporting Compounds 55 and 56 were not tested in this assay. \n</p>"
