    "des (e.g., modified HGP-30) of this invention.</p>Examples of different consensus sequences of HIV-1 which are also specifically included within the scope of the modified HGP-30 antigenic peptides for use as the second peptide in the conjugated peptides of this invention include, for instance, the following, taken from \"HIV-1 Sequence Database, Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1996: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences\", edited by G. Myers, et al . , Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, December 1996, and any of the subsequent yearly updates thereof. The lower case letters represent potential or known cites of amino acid variability resulting from the allelic variations, genetic drift and mutations of the particular consensus sequence; the presence of a \"?\" symbol reflects that there was, at the time of publication, no agreed upon consensus for the amino acid at that position of the consensus sequence: \n\nCONSENSUS A: kSL fNt vat Lye vHq rid vkD tKe Aid kiE eiq nKs k SEQ ID NO: 7 CONSENSUS B: rSL yNt vat Lye vHq rle vkD tKe Aid kiE eEq nKs k SEQ ID NO: 8 CONSENSUS C: rSL ?Nt vat LyC vH? ?Ie vrD tKe Aid kiE eEq nK?
