    "cid 1720 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or amino acid 1900 of SEQ ID NO:1 in mature native human FVIII, and an additional PEG inserted immediately downstream of an amino acid corresponding to amino acid 1656 of SEQ ID NO:1. In some aspects, a recombinant FVIII protein comprises three PEGs inserted immediately downstream of three amino acid positions corresponding to amino acid 26 of SEQ ID NO: 1, amino acid 403 of SEQ ID NO:1, amino acid 1720 of SEQ ID NO:1, or amino acid 1900 of SEQ ID NO:1 in mature native human FVIII, and an additional PEG inserted immediately downstream of an amino acid corresponding to amino acid 1656 of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>3.1.9 HES</p>In certain aspects, a recombinant FVIII protein of the invention comprises at least one hydroxyethyl starch (HES) polymer conjugated in one or more permissive loops or in the a3 region, wherein the recombinant FVIII protein has procoagulant activity and can be expressed in vivo or in vitro in a host cell. HES is a derivative of naturally occurring amylopectin and is degraded by alpha-amylase in the body. HES exhibits advantageous biological properties and is used as a blood volume replacement agent and in hemodilution therapy in the clinics. See, e.g., Sommermeyer et al., Krankenhauspharmazie 8:271-278 (1987); and Weidler et al., Arzneim.-Forschung Drug Res. 41: 494-498 (1991).</p>HES is mainly characterized by the molecular weight distribution and the degree of substitution. HES has a mean molecular weight (weight mean) of from 1 to 300 kD, from 2 to 200 kD, from 3 to 100 kD, or from 4 to 70 kD. Hydroxyethyl starch can further exhibit a molar degree of substitution of from 0.1 to 3, from 0.1 to 2, from 0.1 to 0.9, or from 0.1 to 0.8, and a ratio between C2:C6 substitution in the range of from 2 to 20 with respect to the hydroxyethyl groups. HES with a mean molecular weight of about 130 kD is VOLUVEN\u00ae from Fresenius. VOLUVEN\u00ae is an artificial colloid, employed, e.g., for volume replacement used in the therapeutic indication for therapy and prophylaxis of hypovolaemia. There are a number of HES attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., the same PEG attachment methods described above.</p>In certain aspects, a recombinant FVIII protein comprises at least one heterologous moiety inserted into the a3 region of FVIII (e.g., an insertion site which corresponds to amino acid 1656 of SEQ ID NO:1), either alone or in combination with one or more heterologous moieties being inserted into the permissive loops of the A domains (e.g., A1-1, A1-2, A2-1, A2-2, A3-1, or A3-2 as described above), wherein at least one of the heterologous moieties is a HES sequence. In some aspects, two of the heterologous moieties are HES sequences. In some aspects, three of the heterologous moieties are HES sequences. In some aspects, four of the heterologous moieties are HES sequences. In some aspects, five of the heterologous moieties are HES sequences. In some aspects, six or more of the heterologous moieties are HES sequences.</p>In some aspects, a recombinant FVIII protein comprises one or more HES sequences in an insertion site within a permissive loop, e.g., A1-1, A1-2, A2-1, A2-2, A3-1, A3-2, a3, or any combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the one or more HES sequences are inserted within A1-1. In another embodiment, the one or more HES sequences are inserted"
