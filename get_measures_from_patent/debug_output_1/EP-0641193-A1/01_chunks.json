    " averaged free induction decays (FID'\u03b5), and 1024 data point\u03b5. The \u03b5pectra are partially \u03b5aturated u\u03b5ing the\u03b5e experimental condition\u03b5. Four turn solenoid coils with a Faraday \u03b5hield (Ng et al., J. Magn. Reson. 49:526 (1982)), positioned between the body of the mouse and the coil were used to detect the NMR signal. Control experiments verified that no signal was obtained from non-tumor bearing animal\u03b5 mounted in an identical manner. Spectra were analyzed u\u03b5ing 25 Hz exponential multiplication followed by Fourier tran\u03b5formation. Spectral peak area\u03b5 were e\u03b5timated by fitting the spectra to a series of Lorentzian peaks, using a program (GEMCAP) available on the spectrometer, after fitting the baseline to a third order polynomial (using standard General Electric software). Since other peaks overlap the alpha- and gamma-nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) peaks, the beta-NTP wa\u03b5 used for calculating NTP peak area ratio\u03b5.</p>\n  Thvmidine kinase and Thymidylate svntha\u03b5e assays \u2014 Tis\u03b5ue\u03b5 were homogenzied (Potter-Elveh em homogenizer) a\u03b5 a 20% (wt/vol) solution in Tris-Cl (100 mM, pH 7.6), 2-mercaptoethanol (20 mM) and sodium fluoride (100 mM) . Homogenate\u03b5 were centrifuged at 4 (100,000 x g, 60 min. or 10,000 x g, 30 min) and the \u03b5upernatant fractions retained on ice. Enzyme as\u03b5ay\u03b5 were performed either on individual \u03b5ample\u03b5 or on pooled ti\u03b5sues from three animals. Tumor\u03b5 were between 300-500 mg. Thymidine kinase was measured immediately after cytosol preparation by means of a DE81-filter-binding assay (Ives et al.. Anal. Biochem. 28:192-205 (1969)). The a\u03b5\u03b5ay mixture contained Tris-Cl (100 mM, pH 7.6), ATP (5 mM), MgCl<sub>2</sub> and (5-C<sup>3</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)thymidine</p>\n  SUBSTITUTESHEET \n\n(25 uM, 1.0 Ci/mmol) and cyto\u03b5olic protein. Thymidylate \u03b5ynthase activity wa\u03b5 measured by the release of tritium from (5-<sup>3</sup>H)dUMP (10 uM, 1.0 Ci/mmol), CH<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu (100 uM) and cytosolic fraction (25 uL) (Roberts, Biochemi\u03b5try 5:3546-3548 (1966)). Reaction\u03b5 were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid (10 uL, 0.7M). Protein wa\u03b5 determined by the method of Lowry et al., J. Biol. chem. 193:265-275 (1951).</p>\n  Incorporation of FUra into RNA \u2014 Incorporation of</p>\n  FUra into RNA wa\u03b5 determined by isolating tumor RNA by the acid-guanidine isothiocyanate procedure (Chomczynski et al., Anal. Biochem. 162:156-159 (1987)), after treatment</p>\n  3 with (5- H)FUra (2.0 mCi/mmol). Tis\u03b5ues were harvested</p>\n  4-5 hr after treatment, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70. Tissues were homogenized (80 mg/ml) in the denaturing solution (citrate-sarcosyl laurate-2 mercaptoethanol) and extracted with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (50:40:2). .After extraction the RNA was precipitated with alcohol, washed, redis\u03b5olved and quantitated by uv, and then precipitated with perchloric acid. This final precipitate was collected on GF-C filters and the radioactivity wa\u03b5 determined.</p>\n  Chemotherapeutic Effect\u03b5 on Br"
