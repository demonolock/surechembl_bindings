    "/kg, based on a 70 kg patient. The dosage units are administered from 1 to 5 times daily or by continuous intravenous drip.</p>The pharmaceutical composition of this invention, which contains an active ingredient of formula I, comprises a dosage unit as described above dissolved or suspended in a standard liquid carrier, such as isotonic saline, contained in an ampoule or a multiple dose vial suitable for a parenteral injection such as for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. A composition for insufflation may be similar but is usually administered in a metered dose applicator or inhaler. Pulverized powder compositions may, also, be used along with oily preparations, gels, buffers for isotonic preparations, emulsions or aerosols. Quantities of the active ingredient in nasal products are from 3-7 times greater than those in parenteral products.</p>Antagonistic activity at the V<sub>1</sub> -vasopressin receptors is determined in a protocol which measures the reversal of the vasopressin-induced contraction of rat thoracic aorta tissue. This is expressed as K<sub>B</sub> (nM) in the table below. Such anti-pressor activity is confirmed in a similar in vitro protocol using binding to the plasma membranes of rat liver. V<sub>2</sub> -vasopressin antagonism is determined as receptor binding ability measured by inhibition of 3H-LVP binding (K<sub>B</sub> as nM), by inhibition of adenylate cyclase activation by vasopressin in the medullary tissue of hog kidneys (Ki as nM) or in vivo in the hydropenic rat protocol (ED<sub>300</sub> \u03bcg/kg. These procedures are described in the literature: F. Stassen et al., J. Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 223 50 (1982); F. Stassen et al., lst International Conference on Diuretics, Miami, Fla., Mar. (1984). Antagonistic activity at oxytocin receptors is determined in the isolated rat uterus protocol: W. Sawyer, et al., Endocrinology 106 81 (1979); P. Melin, et al., J. of Endocrinology 88 173 (1981).</p>              TABLE 1                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \nRepresentative Antagonist Activity                                        \n                                 Rat    Rat V.sub.2.sup.e                 \n        Pig V.sub.2.sup.a                                                 \n                 Rat V.sub.1.sup.b                                        \n                          Rat V.sub.1.sup.c                               \n                                 OXT.sup.d                                \n                                        ED.sub.300                        \nCompound                                                                  \n        K.sub.B (nM)                                                      \n                 K.sub.B (nM)                                             \n                          K.sub.B (nM)                                    \n                              "
