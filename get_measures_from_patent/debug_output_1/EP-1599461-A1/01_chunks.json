    "ate (\"GLU\"):</p>Catabolism of NAAG by NAALADase</p></p>NAALADase has been assigned to the M28 peptidase family and is also called PSMA or human GCP II, EC number 3.4.17.21. It is believed that NAALADase is a co-catalytic zinc/zinc metallopeptidase. NAALADase shows a high affinity for NAAG with a Km of 540 nM. If NAAG is a bioactive peptide, then NAALADase may serve to inactivate NAAG'S synaptic action. Alternatively, if NAAG functions as a precursor for glutamate, the primary function of NAALADase may be to regulate synaptic glutamate availability.</p>\"Inhibition,\" in the context of enzymes, refers to reversible enzyme inhibition such as competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition. Competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition can be distinguished by the effects of an inhibitor on the reaction kinetics of an enzyme. Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor combines reversibly with the enzyme in such a way that it competes with a normal substrate for binding at the active site. The affinity between the inhibitor and the enzyme may be measured by the inhibitor constant, Kj, which is defined as:</p>[E][I] \n\n</p>[El] \n\nwherein [E] is the concentration of the enzyme, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, and [El] is the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex formed by the reaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor. Unless otherwise specified, K; refers to the affinity between the inventive compounds and NAALADase. Embodiments include a Ki of less than 100 \u03bcM, less than 10 \u03bcM or less than 1 \u03bcM, as determined using any appropriate assay known in the art. \"IC<sub>50</sub>\" is a related term used to define the concentration or amount of a compound that is required to cause a 50% inhibition of the target enzyme.</p>\"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient or solvent encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ or portion of the body. Each carrier is \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and suitable for use with the patient. Examples of materials that can serve as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include, without limitation: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (1"
