{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a passage from a scientific article or patent, and it discusses the structure and function of a molecule called PAP, but it does not provide specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
