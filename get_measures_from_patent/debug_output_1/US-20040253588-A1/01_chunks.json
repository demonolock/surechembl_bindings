    "that the gene of interest is also present, the presence and expression of the gene may need to be confirmed. For example, if the sequence encoding DME is inserted within a marker gene sequence, transformed cells containing sequences encoding DME can be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a sequence encoding DME under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well. </p>[0266] In general, host cells that contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding DME and that express DME may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations, PCR amplification, and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein sequences. </p>[0267] Immunological methods for detecting and measuring the expression of DME using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on DME is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are well known in the art. (See, e.g., Hampton, R. et al. (1990) Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St. Paul Minn., Sect. IV; Coligan, J. E. et al. (1997) Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York N.Y.; and Pound, J. D. (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa N.J.) </p>[0268] A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding DME include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding DME, or any fragments thereof, may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits, such as those provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega (Madison Wis.), and US Biochemical. Suitable reporter molecules or labels which may be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofact",

USA 88:1013410137.) </p>[0294] Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in the literature. (See, e.g., Orlandi, R. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3833-3837; Winter, G. et al. (1991) Nature 349:293-299.) </p>[0295] Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for DME may also be generated. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>fragments produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity. (See, e.g., Huse, W. D. et al. (1989) Science 246:1275-1281.) </p>[0296] Various immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between DME and its specific antibody. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering DME epitopes is generally used, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Pound, supra). </p>[0297] Various methods such as Scatchard analysis in conjunction with radioimmunoassay techniques may be used to assess the affinity of antibodies for DME. Affinity is expressed as an association constant, K<sub>a </sub>which is defined as the molar concentration of DME-antibody complex divided by the molar concentrations of free antigen and free antibody under equilibrium conditions. The K<sub>a </sub>determined for a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous in their affinities for multiple DME epitopes, represents the average affinity, or avidity, of the antibodies for DME. The K<sub>a </sub>determined for a preparation of monoclonal antibodies, which are monospecific for a particular DME epitope, represents a true measure of affinity. High-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunoassays in which the DME-antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations. Low-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>7 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of DME, preferably in active form, from the antibody (Catty, D.
