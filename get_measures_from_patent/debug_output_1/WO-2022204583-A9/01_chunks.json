    "in the art useful for efficient cell lysis. The cell lysate is then centrifuged or filtered to remove large DNA fragments and cell debris. </p>The bacterial strain used to make the cell lysate generally has reduced nuclease and/or phosphatase activity to increase cell free synthesis efficiency. For example, the bacterial strain used to make the cell free extract can have mutations in the genes encoding the nucleases RNase E and RNase A. The strain may also have mutations to stabilize components of the cell synthesis reaction such as deletions in genes such as tnaA, speA, sdaA or gshA, which prevent degradation of the amino acids tryptophan, arginine, serine and cysteine, respectively, in a cell- free synthesis reaction. Additionally, the strain may have mutations to stabilize the protein products of cell-free synthesis such as knockouts in the proteases ompT or lonP. </p>DNA Expression Cassette without Stop Codon </p>In some embodiments, the nucleic acid template used in the ribosomal display reaction system comprises a DNA expression cassette that is capable of expressing an RNA encoding the protein of interest, where the RNA lacks an operable stop codon. To remove the stop codon from the protein coding region in the expression cassette, a PCR primer lacking the stop codon can be used to amplify the coding region for the protein of interest, such that the entire coding region from the translation start to the sequence encoding the C-terminal amino acid is amplified. </p>MHC Binding Assay with Neoantigen Library </p>The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a collection of genes encoding glycoproteins called MHC proteins. The primary function of an MHC protein in vivo is to present antigen in a form capable of being recognized by a TCR. An MHC protein is bound to an antigen in the form of an antigenic peptide to form an MHC -peptide complex. </p>MHC proteins, also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans and H-2 region in mice, are classified in two categories: class I and class II MHC proteins. These proteins are comprised of a cluster of highly polymorphic genes. Specifically, human HLA- A, HLA-B, and HLA-C are known as class I MHC molecules, whereas human HLA-DP, HLA- DQ and HLA-DR are known as class II MHC molecules. The HLA loci include HLA-DP, HLA-DN, HLA-DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR, HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. Each of these loci contains different alleles in the human population. The different subtypes encoded by these allelic variants are intended to be within the scope of the invention. \n\n An MHC class II protein is a heterodimeric integral membrane protein comprising one a and one b chain in noncovalent association. The a chain has two extracellular domains (on and on), and a transmembrane (TM) and a cytoplasmic (CYT) domain. The b chain contains two extracellular domains (bi and b2), and a TM and CYT domain. An MHC class I protein is an integral membrane protein comprising a glycoprotein heavy chain having three extracellular domains (i.e., ai, on and on), and a TM and CYT domain. The heavy chain is noncovalently associated with a soluble subunit called b2-ih\u03af\u03b0p\u00be1o1&gt;u1\u03afh (b2 ). </p>In some embodiments, the binding assay (e.g., the MHC-peptide-DNA conjugate assay) of the present invention employs the use of a spaceholder molecule linked to the MHC class II component, e.g., the b chain, by a processable linker. A spaceholder molecule of the present invention may be any peptide that is capable of binding to a peptide binding groove of an MHC protein in such a manner that binding of any other peptide in the peptide binding groove is hindered. Preferably, the spaceholder molecule binds within the peptide binding groove with intermediate affinity, and more preferably with low affinity, at approximately neutral pH. In one embodiment, the length of a spaceholder molecule extends from about 5 to about 40 amino acid residues, more preferably from about 6 to about 30 amino acid residues, 8 to about 20 amino acid residues and even more preferably from about 12 to 15 amino acids residues. In a further embodiment, a spaceholder molecule is about 13 amino acids residues. Examples of suitable spaceholder molecules include, without limitation, (in single letter amino acid code) PVSKMRMATPLLMQA (SEQ ID NO: 25), also known as CLIP; AAMAAAAAAAMAA (SEQ ID NO: 26); AAMAAAAAAAAAA (SEQ ID NO: 27); AAF A AAA A A A A A A (SEQ ID NO: 28); ASMSAASAASMAA (SEQ ID NO: 29), and functional equivalents thereof. In one embodiment, the spaceholder molecule will have the consensus sequence AAXAAAAAAAXAA (SEQ ID NO: 30), wherein X is any amino acid. The ability of maintaining a spaceholder molecule within the bindi",
    "tion may range from about 1 amino acid residue to about 40 amino acid residues, more preferably from about 5 amino acid residues to about 30 amino acid residues, and even more preferably from about 8 amino acid residues to about 20 amino acid residues. </p>The cleavage of the linker facilitates the release of the spaceholder molecule thereby freeing the peptide binding groove. The MHC class II component may then be incubated with the library of candidate neoantigens (e.g., a peptide-DNA conjugate library of peptides designed from exome analysis of tumor and wild-type cells) to facilitate the binding of the antigen peptide molecule to the MHC class II component. After sufficient time to allow binding, which can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, the MHC class II component which has bound to the antigen peptide molecule is recovered. </p>In certain embodiments, the step of cleaving the linker and incubating with the antigen peptide molecule is repeated using different antigen peptide molecules. The advantage of repeating these steps is to allow for the formation of a number of MHC class II components that recognize several antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, these steps can be carried out using MHC class II molecules constructed with varying allelic forms of the MHC class II genes. This feature of the assay therefore allows for the generation of several MHC class II components which are specific for a number of different MHC allelic genotypes. </p>Alternatively, the binding assay (e.g., the MHC-peptide-DNA conjugate assay) of the present invention employs a phage display system (see, for example, Hammer J et ak, Promiscuous and allele-specific anchors in HLA-DR-binding peptides, Cell (1993) 74(1): 197- 203). MHC II components are expressed with phage display. The phages expressing the MHC II components are then incubated with the library of candidate neoantigens (e.g., a peptide- DNA conjugate library of peptides designed from exome analysis of tumor and wild-type cells) to facilitate the binding of the antigen peptide molecule to the MHC class II component. After \n\nsufficient time to allow binding, which can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, the MHC class II component which has bound to the antigen peptide molecule is recovered. </p>In certain aspects, an in silico analysis is used to determine specific binding between neoantigens and MHC class I proteins or fragments thereof. The in silico analysis comprises applying a computational algorithm to predict relative binding to MHC I proteins based on the peptide sequences of the neoantigens. Tools such as netMHCpan are used for prediction of binding of peptides/neoantigens to the MHC proteins (see Jurtz et al, NetMHCpan-4.0: Improved Peptide-MHC Class I Interaction Predictions Integrating Eluted Ligand and Peptide Binding Affinity Data, J Immunol (2017) 199(9):3360-3368). The input to this analysis is the peptide sequences and the MHC alleles of interest, and the output is a predicted binding affinity. </p>In certain aspects, neoantigens demonstrating binding with MHC class I molecules or MHC class II molecules in an MHC binding assay or in silico are pooled to form a peptide mixture. This peptide mixture or oligoneucleotides encoding for the peptides from the peptide mixture can then be administered directly to the patient. </p>Vaccine Administration </p>The administration of the peptides or oligonucleotides according to the methods provided herein can be carried out in any suitable manner for administering peptides or oligonucleotides, including but not limited to injection, transfusion, subcutaneously, intradermally, intratumorally, intranodally, intramedullary, intramuscularly, intrathecally, by intravenous or intralymphatic injection, or intraperitoneally. In some embodiments, the neoantigens or oligonucleotides are administered into a cavity formed by the resection of tumor tissue (i.e. intracavity delivery) or directly into a tumor prior to resection (i.e. intratumoral delivery). In one embodiment, the peptides or oligonucleotides are administered by intravenous injection. </p>In an embodiment, the invention includes a method of treating a cancer with one or more neoantigen peptide or with one or more oligonucleotide each having a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a neoantigen peptide, wherein a patient is pre-treated with non- myeloablative chemotherapy prior to the neoantigens treatment or oligonucleotide treatment according to the invention. </p>Methods of Treating Cancer </p>The cancer treated by the disclosed compositions and methods can be any solid tumor. The cancer can also be",

The patients had been diagnosed with lung cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. In addition, a B ALB/c mouse model of colon cancer was used for the collection of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). </p>Tumor biopsies were collected from each human patient and from the mice. The numbers of isolated tumor cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and TILs were determined \n\nfor each human patient. In addition, the MHC alleles and number of mutations were identified for each human patient and for the BALB/c mouse model of colon cancer (see Table 1). </p>Table 1. Identification of MHC alleles and mutations for each human patient and for the BALB/c mouse model of colon cancer. \n<img id=\"imgf000050_0001\" path=\"imgf000050_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/992173962/WO/20221020/A9/002022/20/45/83/imgf000050_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>Example 5. Exome Sequencing, Peptide Library Design, and Binding Assays with Human Samples </p>Whole exome sequencing of tumor exomes and exomes from normal cells was used to design a peptide-DNA conjugate library as outlined in FIGs. 4 and 5. Peptides in the peptide- DNA conjugate library overlapped in sequence and contained wild-type residues (\u201cW\u201d) and mutant residues (\u201cM\u201d) (see FIG. 5). </p>For human patients TG00006 and TG00013 a binding assay was performed as shown in FIG. 6 using the methods outlined in Day et al., J Clin Invest. 2003;112(6):831-842. The binding assay identified peptides with high affinity for the particular human leukocyte antigen serotypes present in each patient (see the larger data points in the upper left-hand comer of each graph shown in FIG. 7). Additional analyses with the binding assay using peptide libraries for human patient TG00013 are shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B. </p>The nucleic acids encoding the peptides with high affinity for the HLA complexes were isolated with the peptide constructs identified using the peptide-DNA conjugate assay. These nucleic acids were sequenced, and the corresponding amino acid sequences are presented in FIG. 9 for human patient TG00013. Comparison of MHC-peptide-DNA conjugate assay results with in silico predictions can be used to identify and confirm neoantigens and/or neoepitopes as shown in FIG. 10. Several additional human patients with various forms of cancer including lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, adenocarcinoma of the stomach, uveal melanoma, basal cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma were \n\nevaluated by collecting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and generating peptides to activate and educate these TILs to enhance recognition of neoantigens and anti-tumor activity (see FIG. 11). A non-limiting example of a process for manufacturing the peptide vaccines is outlined in FIG. 12. </p>Example 6. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Activation with Peptides </p>A peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is any peripheral blood cell having a round nucleus.
