    "matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) -so called stromelysin from the corresponding\nzymogen (FEBS Lett. 299, 353-356, 1989). MMP-3 is known as the key enzyme in\npathogenesis of various malign diseases and also in sclerosis multiplex. </p>The guarantee of the lack of the unwanted or toxic side effect of the inhibitors described is\nthe fact that these are synthesised only from physiologic, so nontoxic compounds, which\nmeans aminoacids (alanine, proline, lysine), higher fatty acids and succinic or glutaric acids.\nCompounds of general structure I can be used in the form of free acids or (for the reason of\nhigher solubility) in the form of soluble salts created with alkali metals, mostly with sodium.\nThe synthesis of oligopeptidic inhibitors of elastase according to this invention including all\nthe intermediates is described in schemes 1, 2 and 3. The final products and intermediates\nare characterized by their melting points (m.p.) or by their optical rotations, in some cases\nby thin layer chromatography (TLC). The values are mentioned in tables I-VI.\nThe key compound for synthesis of all oligopeptidic inhibitors is isobutylamide of alanyl-alanyl-proline\n(Collection Czechoslov. Chem. Commun. 52, 3034-3041, 1987); acylation of\naminoacids by higher fatty residues is described in patent document No CS 280 726. The\nsynthesis of intermediates and of final products is performed in solution and is clear from\nthe examples of preparation. The evaluation (determination of inhibitory constants Ki) by\nhuman leukocyte elastase was performed using known procedure (Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler\n366, 333-343, 1985), the results of determinations of some compounds are described\nin table VII.</p>Following abbreviations and symbols were used:\nAla =alaninePro =prolineLys =lysineSuc =succinylGlt =glutarylKpl =caproylLau =lauroylMyr =myristoylPal =palmitoylZ =benzyloxycarbonylBoc =tert.butyloxycarbonyliBu =isobutyl DCCIN,N' dicyclohexylcarbodiimideOHSuc =N-hydroxysuccinimideEtO-CO-Cl =ethyl chloroformate\n<img id=\"img-00060001\" path=\"00060001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/8899956/EP/20041117/B1/000000/97/92/45/00060001.tif\"/></p>The standard preparation: the rough reaction product was solubilized in AcOEt and\nextracted with 1% citric acid, followed by extraction with H<sub>2</sub>O, then with 5% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and\nagain with H<sub>2</sub>O. The product was dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated. All the\nevaporation was done under reduced pressure on a rotary vacuum evaporator.\nThin layer chromatography (TLC - silica-gel G) was performed in the system S<sub>1</sub>:\nn-butanol-acetic acid-H<sub>2</sub>O (4:1:1).\nOptical rotation was determined using the Perkin-Elmer 141 polarimeter. Melting points\nwere determined on the Koffler block and have not been corrected.\n<img id=\"img-00060002\" path=\"00060002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/8899936/EP/20041117/B1/000000/97/92/45/00060002.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"img-00060003"
