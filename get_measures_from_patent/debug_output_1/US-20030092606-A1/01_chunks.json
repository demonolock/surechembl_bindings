    "proximately 30\u00b0 C. </p>[0018] The inventors have further discovered that the above described pharmaceutical formulation can be further mixed with insulin product and retain short term stability. This mixture may occur, e.g., in a syringe. This short term mixing compatibility is extremely advantageous. This allows administration of a single injection of an amylin agonist, or amylin, along with insulin to a patient. </p>[0019] This invention describes formulations of amylin agonists, or amylins, which are stabilized with respect to aggregation, adsorption and degradation, and thus enhance preservation of their biological activities, although formulations of either an amylin agonist or an amylin which has physicochemical properties similar to those of human amylin, which is poorly soluble and highly unstable should also include a stabilizer, comprising 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or a polyhydric alcohol, and a surfactant, preferably about 0.05 to about 1.0% (w/v) of polysorbate 80 or other non-ionic detergent, should be lyophilized promptly after formulation, and should be used promptly upon reconstitution and are therefore less preferred. Generally, the presently described formulations may be lyophilized according to methods known in the art. </p>[0020] A further aspect of the invention features a formulation including an amylin agonist, mixed with a stabilizing compound which reduces loss of biological potency of the peptide in, for example, an amylin specific receptor binding assay, reduces loss of biological activity as measured in, for example, the in vitro soleus muscle bioassay, and general loss of material by, for example, an HPLC assay, as compared to a formulation consisting of the amylin alone. </p>[0021] In a related aspect, the invention features a method for formulating amylin agonists that retain short term (e.g., up to 24 hours) mixing compatibility with insulin. Certain insulins, such as insulin glargine (Lantus\u00ae), may allow for longer term stability (the term \u201cinsulin,\u201d as used in the presently described formulations, refers to various types of insulins including, for example, insulin glargine). </p>[0022] In another aspect, the present disclosure provides therapeutic methods for treating patients, for example, a method for treating a diabetic patient in need of such treatment comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an amylin or amylin agonist formulation described herein. </p>[0023] Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof, and from the claims. </p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0024]FIG. 1 shows the degradation rates of pramlintide at various pH formulations. </p>[0025]FIG. 2 shows the stability of the pramlintide formulation over time at 30\u00b0 C. </p>[0026]FIG. 3 shows the stability of the pramlintide formulation over time at 40\u00b0 C. </p>[0027]FIG. 4 shows the stability of the pramlintide formulation over tim"
