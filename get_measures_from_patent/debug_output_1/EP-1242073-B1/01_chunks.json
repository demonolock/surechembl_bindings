    " L-5-Carboxy-2-pyrrolidinone, L-5-Oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic\nacid, L-5-Oxoproline, L-Glutamic acid, .gamma.-lactam, L-Glutimic acid, L-Glutiminic acid, L-Pyroglutamic\nacid, L-Pyrrolidinonecarboxylic acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, Oxoproline,\nPCA, Pidolic acid, Pyroglutamic acid, Pyrrolidinonecarboxylic acid, Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic\nacid, and Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid.</p>\n  The DL form of pyroglutamic acid (a mixture of the D and L stereoisomers) is known by\nthe following names: DL-Proline, 5-oxo-(.+-.)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, (.+-.)-Pyroglutamic\nacid , 5-Oxo-DL-proline, DL-2-Pyrrolidinone-5-carboxylic acid, DL-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic\nacid, DL-Pyroglutamate, DL-Pyroglutamic acid, DL-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid,\nand Oxoproline. The DL form is also commercially available from Ajinomoto under the\ntradename Ajidew A 100 and Ajidew N 50 (Na-PCA).</p>\n  Some of the above-listed stereoisomers are commercially available from UCIB, France via\nBamet Products Corp., New Jersey. Such compounds are sold under trade names like Cuivridone\n(Cu-PCA) and L-FER Pidolate (Fe-PCA), and Pidolidone.</p>\n  The compositions of the present invention comprise from 0.01% to \n20% by weight of the composition of pyroglutamic acid, alternatively from 0.1% to\n10%, from 0.25% to 8%, and specifically from 1% to 5%.</p>\n  Organic Acids\n  In addition to PCA, the present invention utilizes organic acids to create a composition\nhostile to the viruses mentioned above. These organic acids have a dissociation constant (pKa)\nfrom 3.0 to 5. When combined with PCA, the composition has an increased\nbuffering capacity, providing a surface pH of the tissue treated in the nasal cavities or turbinates\nfrom 3.5 to 5.5. These organic acids are at levels from 0.01% to 10.00%,\nalternatively from 0.05% to 5.00% and specificaly from 0.10% to 2.50%\nof the composition.</p>\n  Among the organic acids useful in the present invention are those selected from\nascorbic acid, mono-, di-, tri- carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. Specific mono,\ndi or tricarboxylic acids are selected from salicylic, fumaric, benzoic,\nglutaric, lactic, citric, malonic, acetic, glycolic,malic, adipic, succinic, aspartic, phthalic, tartaric,\nglutamic, gluconic, and mixtures thereof. Use of such acids is particularly surprising to one\nskilled in the art in that they create this hostile environment for viruses without significantly\nirritating the nasal tissues the compositions they contact.</p>\n  Agents are used to adjust the pH of the composition of the present invention to less than 4.5.\nTherefore, when the composition is applied to nasal tissues, the pH of the composition on the\nnasal tissues remains from 3.5 to 5.5, but is not so low as to cause irritation of the nasal\ntissues. Such pH- adjusting agents include those normally associated with use in topical nasal\ncompositions including sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium hydroxide, ammonium\nhydroxide, sodium stannate, triethanolamine, sodium citrate, "
