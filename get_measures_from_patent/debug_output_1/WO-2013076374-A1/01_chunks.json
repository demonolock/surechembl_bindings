    "the most frequent genotype of a virus found in nature and against which mutants are defined. </p>The term \"anti-viral response\" as used herein refers to a cell's response to viral infection and includes, for example, production of interferons, cytokine release, production of chemokines, production of lymphokines or a combination thereof. \n\n The expressions \"normal host cell\" and \"normal tissue\" as used herein refer to a noncancerous, non-infected cell or tissue with an intact anti-viral response. </p>The term \"oncolytic agent\" as used herein refers to an agent capable of inhibiting the growth of and/or killing tumour cells. </p>The term \"subject\" as used herein refers to any living organism, including humans and animals, human and animal tissue, and human and animal cells. An object of the present invention was to develop novel therapeutically effective oncolytic adenoviruses with improved safety properties for cancer therapy and to solve problems encountered in conventional cancer therapy and in cancer virotherapy. </p>The inventors have surprisingly found an oncolytic adenoviral vector which is both therapeutically effective and safe in use. The recombinant adenovirus according to the invention comprises one or more of the following elements: an adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) nucleic acid backbone; a nucleic acid sequence encoding a tumor specific human E2F-1 promoter replacing the E1A promoter for the control of the of E1A gene transcription; a 24 bp deletion (D24) in the Rb binding constant region 2 of adenoviral El ; a nucleic acid sequence encoding a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the place of the deleted gpl9k/6.7K in the adenoviral E3 region; a nucleic acid sequence replacing the serotype 5 adenoviral fiber knob region with that of a serotype 3 adenovirus knob region; with or without a nucleic acid sequence comprising CpG island in the E3 region after GMCSF-gene; with or without a mutated KKTK-region in the fiber shaft region. The unexpected efficacy of the inventive oncolytic adenovirus provides a significant improvement in the therapeutic efficacy as demonstrated in in vivo studies in comparison to previous oncolytic adenoviruses. The safety record of the inventive oncolytic adenovirus is also excellent. Efficacy and safety of the agents was found to be unexpectedly good especially in human patients. </p>In some aspects, the present invention provides cells comprising the adenoviral vector of the invention.
