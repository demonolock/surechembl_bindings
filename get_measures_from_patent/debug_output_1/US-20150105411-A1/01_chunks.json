General pathways for cullin-ring ligase (CRL) ubiquitination of protein substrates and for neddylation. In CRLs, the cullin subunit must be modified on a conserved lysine by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to activate holoenzyme activity. NEDD8 activation and conjugation to cullin proteins is catalyzed via an enzymatic cascade that is homologous to ubiquitination involving NEDD8's E1 (NAE) and E2 (Ubc12). Removal of NEDD8 from cullin is catalyzed by the COP9 signalosome. Deneddylation facilitates dissociation of CRL components. The cullin-RING core is sequestered in an inactive state by binding to CAND1 until it is recruited to form a new CRL.</p>FIG. 3. Response of a cell line panel 2 to MLN4924.

TP53 mutant colon cancer cell lines are more resistant (higher percent of control viability) to MLN4924 treatment than TP53 wt cell lines.</p>FIGS. 6A-D. Effect of TP53 Loss on Viability of Cancer Cell Lines Following Treatment with Different Doses of MLN4924 at Multiple Time Points. The effect of TP53 knock-out on the sensitivity of paired HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines to MLN4924 was measured by ATPlite, across a range of MLN4924 concentrations and time points. Data are represented as mean\u00b1SEM, N=3. Dotted line, p53 knock-out; solid line, p53 wild type.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTIONOne of the continued problems with therapy in cancer patients is individual differences in response to therapies. While advances in development of successful cancer therapies progress, only a subset of patients respond to any particular therapy. With the narrow therapeutic index and the toxic potential of many available cancer therapies, such differential responses potentially contribute to patients undergoing unnecessary, ineffective and even potentially harmful therapy regimens.

As can be seen in FIG. 5, TP53 mutations are significantly correlated with resistance to MLN4924 in colon cancer cell lines (p-value=0.04022).</p>Similar analysis of associations in other tissues indicates that TP53 mutation is associated with MLN4924 resistance in breast cancer and lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.</p>Additional mutations were analyzed for possible association of tumor histology with resistance or sensitivity to MLN4924 treatment. Table 6 provides results from analysis of panel 1 and Table 7 provides results from analysis of panel 2, whose smaller size proved a challenge for this type of analysis. The cutoff of association with the tissues was chosen at p-values of &lt;0.05.</p>TABLE 6Association of mutation with histology in Panel 1TumorN mutantsN wildN mutantsN wildTissuethistype thisalltype allSourceMutationcancercancercancerscancersAssociationp-valueHead_NeckTP5315111179sensitive0.0001Head_NeckCDKN2A1249496sensitive0.0072Head_NeckSMAD431315175sensitive0.0262CervixTP531612451resistant0.0027LungRB12419156resistant0.0178BoneRB11512178sensitive0.0477</p>TABLE 7Association of mutation with histology in Panel 2TumorN mutantsN wildN mutantsN wildTissuethistype thisalltype allSourceMutationcancercancercancerscancersAssociationp-valueskinCDKN2A813043resistant0.0022skinCDKN2A.p14632647resistant0.0004skinTP53275320resistant0.0036CNSCDKN2A.p14542647resistant0.0466**p-value for CNS derived from percent of control viability.

A similar contrast was found for CDKN2A mutations in skin and central nervous system (CNS). CDKN2A or CDKN2A.p14 mutations were associated with resistance to MLN4924 treatment in skin and CNS tumor cell lines, despite the general association with CDKN2A mutation and sensitivity to MLN4924 treatment. Tables 6 and 7 also show that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with resistance in cervical cancer and skin cancer; CDKN2A mutations are significantly associated with sensitivity in head and neck cancer; SMAD4 mutations are significantly associated with sensitivity in head and neck cancer; RB1 mutations are significantly associated with resistance in lung cancer; and RB1 mutations are significantly associated with sensitivity in bone cancer.</p>Example 3Individual Cell Line Screening ResultsThe following tables include results of the individual cell line screens which led to conclusions about markers whose mutations confer sensitivity to MLN4924.
