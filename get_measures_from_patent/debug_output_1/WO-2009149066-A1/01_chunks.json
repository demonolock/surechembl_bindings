    "h, 1994, utilizes hypotonic lysis, successive polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitations, and anion exchange chromatography. ZR-75-1 cells are cultured at 37 <sup>0</sup>C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in RPMI culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin.</p>[00149] Ten T150 flasks of confluent cells are lysed with 1.5 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-</p>HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1% Igepal CA- 630) and bounce homogenized on ice for 20 strokes. The lysate is centrifuged in JA-20 rotor (Beckman) at 20,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 <sup>0</sup>C and the supernatant is brought to 42 ml with lysis buffer. A solution of 50% PEG 8000 in lysis buffer is added slowly to the supernatant to a final concentration of 7.5%. After rocking for 60 minutes at 4 <sup>0</sup>C, the solution is centrifuged in</p>52</p>PHl 2330630vl 06/02/09 \n\n JA-20 rotor (Beckman) at 15,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 <sup>0</sup>C. Solid PEG 8000 is then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15%. After the rocking and centrifugation is repeated as above, the pellet is resuspended overnight at 4 <sup>0</sup>C in 10 ml of Buffer A (20 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). After 0.45 \u03bcM filtration, the protein solution is applied to a Mono Q 5/5 anion exchange column (Pharmacia). The column is washed for 15 minutes with buffer A at 1 ml/minute, and bound material is eluted with a linear 60-ml gradient over 60 minutes to 1 M KCl. FAS (MW- 270 kD) typically elutes at 0.25 M KCl in three 0.5 ml fractions identified using 4-15% SDS- PAGE with Coomassie G250 stain (Bio-Rad). FAS protein concentration is determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) according to manufacturer's specifications using BSA as a standard. This procedure results in substantially pure preparations of FAS (&gt;95%) as judged by Coomassie- stained gels.</p>[00150] Measurement of FAS Enzymatic Activity and Determination of the IC 50 of the</p>Compounds FAS activity is measured by monitoring the malonyl-CoA dependent oxidation of NADPH spectrophotometrically at OD<sub>34O</sub> in 96- well plates (DiIs et al and Arslanian et al, 1975). Each well contains 2 \u03bcg purified FAS, 100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), and 187.5 \u03bcM \u03b2-NADPH (Sigma). Stock solutions of inhibitors are prepared in DMSO at 2, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml resulting in final concentrations of 20, 10, and 5 \u03bcg/ml when 1 \u03bcl of stock is added per well. For each experiment, cerulenin (Sigma) is run as a positive control along with DMSO controls, inhibitors, and blanks (no FAS enzyme) all in duplicate.</p>[00151] The assay is performed on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus</p>Spectrophotometer. The plate containing FAS, buffers, inhibitors, and controls are placed in the spectrophotometer heated to 37\u00b0C. Using the kinetic protocol, the wells are blanked on duplicate wells containing 100 \u03bcl of 100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.5 and the plate is read at OD<sub>340</sub> at 10 sec</p>PHl 2330630vl 06/02/09 \n\n intervals for 5 minutes to measure any malonyl-CoA independent oxidation of NADPH. The plate is removed from the spectrophotometer and malonyl-CoA (67.4 \u03bcM, final concentration per well) and alkynyl-CoA (61.8 \u03bcM, final concentration per well) are added to each well except to the blanks. The plate is read again as above with the kinetic protocol to measure the malonyl- CoA dependent NADPH oxidation. Th"
