{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nFAS (MW- 270 kD) typically elutes at 0.25 M KCl in three 0.5 ml fractions identified using 4-15% SDS- PAGE with Coomassie G250 stain (Bio-Rad).\nEach well contains 2 \u03bcg purified FAS, 100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), and 187.5 \u03bcM \u03b2-NADPH (Sigma).\nStock solutions of inhibitors are prepared in DMSO at 2, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml resulting in final concentrations of 20, 10, and 5 \u03bcg/ml when 1 \u03bcl of stock is added per well.\nThe plate is read at OD<sub>340</sub> at 10 sec intervals for 5 minutes to measure any malonyl-CoA independent oxidation of NADPH.\nThe plate is read again as above with the kinetic protocol to measure the malonyl- CoA dependent NADPH oxidation.\n\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that none of these sentences contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value, and a unit.\n\n\nAfter re-examining the text, I found one sentence that comes close, but it's still missing the bioactivity metric:\n\n\nNone of the sentences meet the criteria.\n\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to extract sentences that contain at least three of the required components or provide more context about the molecules and metrics mentioned in the text."}
