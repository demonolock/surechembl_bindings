    "mount of or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt which eliminates, alleviates, or provides relief of the symptoms for which it is administered. The disclosed compositions are administered in any suitable manner, often with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable methods of administering treatment in the context of the present invention to a subject are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention, should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, or to inhibit disease progression. Thus, the composition is administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective response and/or to alleviate, reduce, cure or at least partially arrest symptoms and/or complications from the disease. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a \u201ctherapeutically effective dose.\u201d</p>In general, an appropriate dosage and treatment regimen involves administration of the active compound(s) in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit. Such a response can be monitored by establishing an improved clinical outcome (e.g., more frequent remissions, complete or partial, or longer disease-free survival) in treated patients as compared to non-treated patients.</p>In some embodiment, IC50 for inhibition of wild-type DDR2 kinase activity is in the range of 600 nM for imatinib, 50 nM for nilotinib and 1.5 nM for dasatinib (Day E, et al. Inhibition of collagen-induced discoidin domain receptor 1 and 2 activation by imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. Molec Cell Pharm 2008; 599:44-53), which are below the achievable plasma trough concentrations of the drugs in their current daily oral dosing (4 uM, 2 uM and 100 nM respectively, see Bradeen et al. Blood 2006; 108:2332-2338).</p>The DDR2 inhibitor and BRAF inhibitor, if both administered, can be administered sequentially or concurrently, and may be formulated separately or as a single composition.</p>Kits</p>In one embodiment of the invention, a kit may be used for conducting the diagnostic and prognostic methods described herein. Typically, the kit should contain, in a carrier or compartmentalized container, reagents useful in any of the above-described embodiments of the diagnostic method. The carrier can be a container or support, in the form of, e.g., bag, box, tube, rack, and is optionally compartmentalized. The carrier may define an enclosed confinement for safety purposes during shipment and storage. A kit as disclosed herein may contain printed or electronic instructions for performing an assay that employs the reagents contained in the kit. In one embodiment, the kit includes one or more PCR primers capable of amplifying and sequencing. Relevant primers include</p>Exon3FTCCAGTTCCAACACCATCTTC(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u2003",

Approximately 50% of the DDR2 mutations in melanoma were associated with concurrent mutations of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase at codon 600. Based on the mutation levels, DDR2 and BRAF mutations are predicted to be present in most, if not all, of the tumor cells.</p>These findings suggest that dysregulation by a DDR2 mutation plays a role in melanoma progression because, unlike BRAF mutations, we have not found DDR2 mutations in nevi. This finding is interesting in light of a previous study, which demonstrates that DDR2 downregulation in a melanoma cell line can modulate its metastatic potential (Oncol Rep 2011 October; 26(4):971-8) and mediate cell cycle arrest and the adhesion phenotype of primary tumor cells (Frontiers in Bioscience 10, 2922-2931, Sep. 1, 2005). This finding may also be useful for distinguishing melanoma from nevi, which can be difficult to distinguish both clinically and histologically.</p>DDR2 mutations provide a targetable genetic feature in a group of melanomas for tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. IC50 for inhibition of wild-type DDR2 kinase activity is in the range of 600 nM for imatinib, 50 nM for nilotinib and 1.5 nM for dasatinib (Day E, et al. Inhibition of collagen-induced discoidin domain receptor 1 and 2 activation by imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. Molec Cell Pharm 2008; 599:44-53), which are below the achievable plasma trough concentrations of the drugs in their current daily oral dosing (4 uM, 2 uM and 100 nM respectively, see Bradeen et al. Blood 2006; 108:2332-2338).</p>Therefore, melanoma may be treated by targeting DDR2 kinase activity along with targeting BRAF kinase activity. This discovery therefore opens up an additional therapeutic option for patients with melanoma.</p>Example 3Genomic DNA extracted from FFPE blocks or tissue sections in routine clinical tumor samples can be sequenced by standard PCR-based dideoxy chain termination sequencing (\u201cSanger\u201d method).
