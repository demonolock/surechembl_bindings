For agonist testing, 30 \u03bc L of cell suspension was injected onto 30 \u03bc L of test compound or reference agonist in the assay plate. The resulting light emission was recorded for 90 seconds using FDSS 6000. Dose response curves for the reference compound were performed before the test compound.

To normalize the recorded light emission across the plate and across different experiments (determine the \"100% signal\"), some wells contained 100 \u03bc M digitonin or a saturating concentration of ATP (20 \u03bc M). The plate also contained a reference agonist at a concentration equal to the EC obtained during test validation<sub>80</sub>And EC<sub>100</sub>.
