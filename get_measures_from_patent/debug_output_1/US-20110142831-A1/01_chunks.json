    "quence Database Accession Numbers NP703191, NP703190 and NP116121, or naturally occurring variants of these sequences.</p>\u201cInterleukin-23 (or \u201cIL-23) means a protein consisting of two polypeptide chains. One chain consists essentially of the sequence of the mature form of human IL23, subunit p19 (also known as IL23A) as described in any of NCBI Protein Sequence Database Accession Numbers NP057668, AAH67511, AAH66267, AAH66268, AAH66269, AAH667512, AAH67513 or naturally occurring variants of these sequences. The other chain consists essentially of the sequence of the mature form of human IL12, subunit p40 (also known as IL12B and IL23, subunit p40) as described in any of NCBI Protein Sequence Database Accession Numbers NP002178, P29460, AAG32620, AAH74723, AAH67502, AAH67499, AAH67498, AAH67501 or naturally occurring variants of these sequences.</p>\u201cInterleukin-23R\u201d or \u201cIL-23R\u201d means a single polypeptide chain consisting essentially of the sequence of the mature form of human IL23R as described in NCBI Protein Sequence Database Accession Number NP653302 or naturally occurring variants thereof.</p>\u201cMonoclonal antibody\u201d or \u201cmAb\u201d means an antibody obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.</p>\u201cParenteral administration\u201d means an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection.</p>\u201cSmall molecule\u201d means a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kD, typically less than 2 kD, and preferably less than 1 kD. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. Peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines are known in the art. See, e.g., Casset, et al. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 307:198-205; Muyldermans (2001) J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302; Li (2000) Nat. Biotechnol. 18:1251-1256; Apostolopoulos, et al. (2002) Curr. Med. Chem. 9:411-420; Monfardini, et al. (2002) Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2185-2199; Domingues, et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6:652-656; Sato and Sone (2003) Biochem. J. 371:603-608; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al.</p>\u201cSpecific\u201d or \u201cspecifically\u201d, when referring to the binding interaction between the members of a binding pair, such as a cytokine and its receptor, and antibody and its antigen or epitope, indicates a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of one member of the binding pair in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, one member of a binding pair has a significantly greater affinity for the other member of the binding pair than for irrelevant proteins. For example, an antibody is considered to be specific for a particular protein if it binds to that protein with an affinity that is at least 10-fold, and preferably 50-fold higher than its affinity for a different protein.
