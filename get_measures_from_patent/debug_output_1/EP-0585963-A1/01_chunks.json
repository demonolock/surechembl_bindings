    "or under appropriate stimulation, and many cell types respond, and in a variety of ways. IL-1 is found at sites of inflammation, and when injected as a purified protein, results in erythema and an influx of granulocytes from the bloodstream and secondarily, tissue destruction (Beck et al, J. Immunol., 136: 3025-3031, 1986; Pettipher et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83: 8749-8753, 1986).</p>Several laboratories have shown that endothelial cells have a rapid response to IL-1 which is consistent with their accessory nature in the inflammatory reaction. Two of the best described responses are an increase in procoagulant activity (Bevilacqua et al, 1984, supra) and a concomitant increase in adhesive capacity for leucocytes (Bevilacqua et al, J. Clin. Invest., 76: 2003-2011, 1985).</p>As the lining of blood vessels, endothelial cells are uniquely positioned to regulate the traffic in inflammatory cells and their reactive by-products. In addition, endothelial cells can themselves secrete into the bloodstream newly synthesized proteins which may be an early indicator of the inflammatory process. Despite this key role, very few therapeutic approaches or diagnostic indicators have been developed that directly address the role of this cell type. The biology of endothelial cells is starting to be understood now in much better detail due to the recent success in culturing these cells in the laboratory.</p>As mentioned above, a key mediator of the inflammatory response is IL-1. IL-1 is a 17 Kd polypeptide secreted by macrophages and many other cell types which is capable of eliciting a wide array of responses ranging, from induction of fever, to proliferation of inflammatory cells and the recruitment of mature leucocytes from precursors in the bone marrow (reviewed by Dinarello, FASEB J., 2: 106-115, 1988).</p>Endothelial cells both respond to and secrete IL-1 at a very early stage of the inflammatory process. While a byproduct of bacterial infection with gram negative organisms is the production of endotoxin and the consequent secondary production of IL-1, the issue of whether mechanical injury can trigger IL-1 release is a critical but as yet unanswered question for students of sports-induced inflammation.</p>It is believed, based upon work by several laboratories in the past decade, that the binding of leucocytes to the vascular wall, a process that can be mimicked in vitro with IL-1 treatment of endothelial cells, is the first step in the diapedesis of leucocytes into the tissue space. However, several aspects of this process, especially as they may be related to the utility of current anti-inflammatory agents for intervention, remain unclear.</p>IL-1 induces a rapid alteration in the membrane properties of cultured human endothelial cells. This is evident from the ability of treated cells to bind leucocytes, their acquisition of procoagulant activity and the expression of new cell surface antigens including some for which no functional property has yet been",

    " to perform blocking assays. Recombinant human IL-1 beta was added at a concentration of 1 ng/ml to cells in culture for 4 to 6 hours while the cells were maintained as usual in a humidified incubation chamber containing 6% CO\u2082, 94% air. Controls consisted of culturing endothelial cells in the absence of IL-1. After the incubation period, cells were rinsed with medium to remove unused IL-1, and the respective monoclonal antibodies were added at concentrations ranging from 0.0016 to 10 \u00b5g/ml for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The F(ab')\u2082 fragment of monoclonal antibody 2G7, obtained by conventional methods, was also used for this assay. The cells whose binding was being studied were overlaid for 30 to 60 minutes to allow attachment. The cells used were human monocytes, granulocytes or a mixture of mononuclear cells comprising T-cells, B-cells and NK cells: These cells were isolated and purified by methods known in the art. The non-adherent cells were washed off by rinsing with growth medium, and the difference in the number of cells bound to endothelial cells (EC) untreated or treated with IL-1 was observed. \nThis assay was performed in a quantitative manner by incorporating a radioactive tracer, e.g., \u2075\u00b9Cr, by methods known in the art, into the cytoplasm of the cells whose binding was being studied, washing to remove any extracellular counts, and placing these labeled cells over the EC monolayer. The \u2075\u00b9Cr label used for this purpose showed minimal leakage during the 30 to 60 minutes of the binding assay. After rinsing to remove non-adherent cells, the monolayers were solubilized with detergent. The radioactivity counted from each well was a measure of the number of cells bound.\n\nThe results showing inhibition of mononuclear cell binding by different doses of the F(ab')\u2082 fragment of monoclonal antibody 2G7 and 10 \u00b5g/ml of monoclonal antibody 1E7 are shown in Figure 4. The results show that monoclonal antibody 2G7, but not monoclonal antibody 1E7, when used to pretreat IL-1 activated endothelial cells, causes dose-dependent partial inhibition of the binding of human mononuclear cells to endothelial cells. The F(ab')\u2082 fragment of monoclonal antibody 7A9 also showed dose-dependent inhibition of cells as shown in Table I.\n\nThe results for all four monoclonal antibodies tested are summarized in Table I.<img id=\"ib0001\" path=\"imgb0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/179482848/EP/19940309/A1/000000/58/59/63/imgb0001.tif\"/>\n\nTable I compares properties of the monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention with those of the closest published antibodies. H4/18 is the first antibody raised against IL-1 stimulated endothelial cells (Pober et al, J. Immunol., 136: 1680-1687, 1986). H18/7 is a monoclonal antibody raised against IL-1 stimulated endothelial cells and it partially blocks granulocyte adhesion to IL-1 stimulated endothelial cells (Bevilacqua et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84: 9238-9241, 1987). S12 is a monoclonal antibody that bin",
    " was added 5 \u00b5g of purified monoclonal antibody for an additional 1 hour at room temperature. Following ten washes with PBS-TWEEN, 1-3x10\u2076 cpm of lysate was added to each well at 4\u00b0 C for 2 hours with gentle rocking. Wells were washed with PBS-TWEEN, dried and extracted with reducing sample buffer and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels, either reducing or non-reducing. The gels were 8% acrylamide for the 3A2 and 7A9 samples and 10% acrylamide for the 1E7 and 2G7 samples.\n\nThe results are shown in Figures 7 and 8 and are summarized in Table III. The results were as follows (the values in parenthesis are the average of results obtained from three experiments:\n(1) monoclonal antibody 1E7 and monoclonal antibody 2G7 lysates showed a major band at 125 (114) kDa and a minor band at 97(95) kDa under reducing conditions and a major band at 99 (100) kDa and a minor band at 87 (93) kDa under non-reducing conditions (results under reducing conditions are not shown in the figures);(2) monoclonal antibody 3A2 lysates showed one band at 177 (170) kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, and;(3) monoclonal antibody 7A9 lysates showed one band at 100 kDa under reducing conditions and one band at 90 kDa under non-reducing conditions.\n\nAs is shown in Example 4 below, the antigen to which monoclonal antibodies 1E7 and 2G7 specifically bind are the same antigen as are the antigens to which monoclonal antibodies 7A9 and 3B7 specifically bind.\n(B) Antigen Distribution: A general binding assay was performed as follows: 20,000 HUVEC were plated in each well of a 96 well microtiter plate on a gelatin coated surface. Cells were left overnight in growth medium (See Example 1) to allow full attachment. The following day cells were exposed to 1 ng/ml IL-1 for 4 hours, washed and incubated separately with each of the monoclonal antibodies at 5 \u00b5g/ml. Controls consisted of HUVEC not exposed to IL-1, or exposed to IL-1 but not exposed to antibody. After 1 hour Incubation at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse reagent at a 1/1000 dilution. After 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, cells were rinsed and exposed to a 1/10 dilution of \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Streptavidin. After 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, cells were rinsed and lysed with TRITON X-100 detergent (1%), and aliquots were counted in a gamma counter. \nFor assay of non-adherent cells such as T-cells, B-cells and granulocytes plates were spun in a centrifuge to pellet cells prior to removal of medium. Cells were resuspended in appropriate medium for the next incubation.\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 9. Figure 9 shows that all four monoclonal antibodies, 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 bind to IL-1 activated human endothelial cells (HEC), but not significantly to normal resting HEC. This indicates that the antigens to which monoclonal antibodies 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 bind are found on IL-1 activated HEC in accordance with the results reported in Example 2.\n\nThe presence of the antigen corresponding to each of the four monoclonal antibodies was determined as in the general binding assay except that in addition to endothelial cells other cell types were used and the incubation time (as above) with IL-1 was for 4 hours. The other cell types were human fibroblasts (MRHF, keratinocytes (NHEK) and endothelial cells (HUVEC).\n\nThe results are shown in Table II below.<img id=\"ib0003\" path=\"imgb0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/179482851/EP/19940309/A1/000000/58/59/63/imgb0003.tif\"/>\n\nThe data in Table II show that ail four monoclonal antibodies, 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 bind to IL-1 activated HEC, but not significantly to normal resting or IL-1 activated human epidermal keratinocytes or resting or IL-1 activated human fibroblasts. This data indicates that the antigens to which monoclonal antibodies 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 bind are found on IL-1 activated HEC.\n\nThe same protocol as for the general binding assay was used except that instead of using endothelial cells, granulocytes and mononuclear cells (T-, B- and monocyte cells) were used. Granulocytes and mononuclear cells were isolated from human heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque separation according to known methods.\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 10. Figure 10 shows that the four monoclonal antibodies 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 do not bind significantly to a mixture of normal resting or IL-1 activated human granulocytes or mononuclear cells.\n\nThis data along with that from Figure 9 and Table II indicate that the monoclonal antibodies 1E7, 3A2, 7A9 and 2G7 are specific for IL-1 activated HEC.\n(C) Antigen Kinetics in Vitro: HUVEC were plated in different petri dishes (35 mm diameter) after gelatin coating of the plastic. Growth medium (described in Example 1) was added and the cells were cultured for the duration of the experiment in growth medium to which was added I ng/ml of IL-1. The times at which the cells were initially plated were staggered such that all cells were harvested on the same day but after different times of addition of IL-1 so that some cells were exposed to IL-1 for the last 12 hours only, the full 96 h, or for intermediate times. The HUVEC were detached from petri dishes using PBS/EDTA, washed twice in PBS-BSA and placed at 75,000 cells per well in round bottom microtiter plates. To these wells were added individually each of the four monoclonal antibodies, 1E7, 2G7, 3A2 and 7A9, at 5 \u00b5g/ml for 30",
    "l of the clones of PCR amplified ELAM-1 coding sequence. Therefore the correct sequence is believed to be this new sequence. One of the clones, SPELAM-4 contained the same sequence as that of the published sequence except the differences at nucleotide positions 1518 and 1916. The ELAM-1 coding sequence insert was released from this clone following digestion with Not-I and Sma-I and cloned into the expression vector pCDN-1.\n\nThe resulting ELAM-1 expression plasmid is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15 shows the plasmid (pCDN-1; T.V. Gopal, unpublished work) containing SV40 early promoter (area with diagonal bars) and SV40 \"t\" splice and polyA addition sequences (dotted area) derived from pSV2 NEO (Southern and Berg, J. Mol. Applied Genetics, 1: 327-341, 1982). The rest of the plasmid contained pBR322 (\u2015) sequences. Important restriction sites are identified in the figure. MCS indicates multiple cloning sites. Other commonly available mammalian expression vectors such as pEUK-C1, pEUK-C2 and pMAM-neo (Clontech Laboratories, CA) can be used in place of pCDN-1 to study transient expression of ELAM-1 in COS cells.\n\nMock or ELAM-1 transfected COS cells were used to test the reactivity of the 4 monoclonal antibodies. Preliminary experiments, not shown, indicated that approximately 2-5% of ELAM-1 transfected cells bound to HL-60 tumor targets, whereas the mock transfected cells displayed only occasional HL-60 binding. Mock transfected and ELAM-1 transfected cells were screened in a plate binding assay analogous to that described in Example 1.\n\nBriefly, COS cells (2 x 10\u2074/well) were plated into microtiter wells 24 hours prior to assay and 48 hours after transfection. Cells were incubated successively with medium alone (control) or 1 \u00b5g/ml each of the four purified monoclonal antibodies followed by biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody and \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-streptavidin.\n\nTransfection was carried out as follows. Twenty micrograms of pCDN ELAM-1 plasmid DNA was transfected into approximately 1 x 10\u2076 COS cells by the DNA-CaPO\u2084 coprecipitation method of Wigler et al, Cell, 16: 777-785, 1979. Four hours after the addition of the DNA-CaPO\u2084 precipitate the cells were treated with 15% glycerol for two minutes at room temperature according to the method of Parker and Stark, J. Virol., 31: 360-396, 1979. The same amount of the vector plasmid DNA without any insert was used as control for transfection into 1 x 10\u2076 cells to obtain mock transfected cells. Cells were harvested approximately forty eight hours after glycerol shock and used for antibody binding studies. ELAM-1 transfected but not mock-transfected cells efficiently bound HL60 cells (data not shown).\n\nThe data from one of three experiments with identical results is shown in Figure 16. In this figure, the results are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 s.e.m. n = 3) of the total cpm/well. The figure demonstrates that neither the 1E7 nor 2G7 antibodies are reactive with the ELAM-1 gene product, while both 3B7 and 7A9 do react. This patte",
    "antigens after neuraminidase treatment, consistent with the results obtained by treatment of intact cells (Figure 18). Treatment to remove O-linked sugars caused only a slight reduction in mass, approximately 1-2 kDa for both the 2G7 and 7A9 antigens in two experiments.\n\n(G) Kinetics of Antigen Synthesis: In order to further show the similarities and differences between the 2G7 and 7A9 glycoproteins, the glycoproteins were immunoprecipitated as described above at different times after the addition of IL-1 to the HUVEC cultures. \u00b3\u2075S-cysteine was added the time of IL-1 addition. TRITON X-100 lysates were made and immunoprecipitates were formed with either the 2G7 or the 7A9 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide reducing gels. \nThe results, shown in Figure 20, indicate that at 1 hour only the 7A9 (ELAM-1) antigen can be detected, though weakly. It has presumably already undergone some degree of glycosylation since its mass at this time is approximately 79 kDa, not the 67 kDa seen after tunicamycin treatment. By 2 hours the 2G7 immunoprecipitate shows two bands of equal intensity at approximately 95 kDa and 114 kDa while at this time the 7A9 (ELAM-1) antigen is at its \"mature\" form of a broad band at around 95 kDa. By 6 hours the 2G7 antigen shows the major band at 114 kDa\n\n(H) Competition Binding Assays: In order to test the spatial relatedness of the four epitopes defined on these two proteins by the different monoclonal antibodies, a competition binding assay was performed wherein each of the purified monoclonal antibodies was coupled with FITC and tested in flow cytometry for their ability to compete in homologous and heterologous combinations. \nFITC conjugates of each monoclonal antibody, 1E7, 2G7, 7A9 and 3B7, were tittered on IL-1-activated endothelial cells to determine a slightly subsaturating dose. This dose of FITC antibody was premixed with a 50-fold excess of each of the four unconjugated monoclonal antibodies. This mixture was then added to a single cell suspension of IL-1-activated HUVEC at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were washed three times in the same buffer and resuspended for flow cytometric analysis.\n\nFITC conjugation of monoclonal antibodies at 4 mg/ml in 0.1 M carbonate buffer at pH 9.5 was performed as described (Hardy, in Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Vol. 1, 4th Edition, 1986 - (Weir, D.M. ed.) Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, England, 3101-3112).\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 21. The ocular FITC-antibody used for each of the four experiments shown was as follows: Figure 21A : 1E7; Figure 21B : 2G7; Figure 21C : 3B7; Figure 21D : 7A9. On the vertical axis is the percent positive cells.\n\nThe results indicate that a 50-fold excess 1E7, 2G7, and 3B7 compete only for the binding of the homologous FITC-monoclonal antibody. The 7A9 antibody is different in that it reproducibly interferes with the binding of the 2G7 antibody, a maximum of 62% at a 1:50 molar ratio 2G7:7A9.\n\n(I) Kinetics of Antigen Expression at the Cell Surface: HUVEC were cultured for different periods of time in 1 ng/ml of IL-1, and analyzed for the 2G7 and 7A9 antigens using the 96-well plate binding assay essentially as performed for the hybridoma screening assay. All cells were analyzed at the same time. \nThe results are shown in Figure 22, wherein closed circles represent antibody 2G7 and closed triangles represent antibody 7A9. The results are expressed as the mean c.p.m. \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 3).\n\nThe results shown in Figure 22 demonstrate that by 2 hours the 7A9 (ELAM-1) protein is maximally expressed, while the 2G7 antigen is only half maximally expressed. By 4 hours the 2G7 antigen has reached the maximum level. This result is consistent with the somewhat earlier expression of the 7A9 (ELAM-1) protein in biosynthetic labeling experiments (Figure 20). Interestingly, in the continued presence of IL-1, both proteins are expressed at the cell surface at high levels for up to seven days. If IL-1 is withdrawn, they return to baseline levels within 24 hours (data not shown).\n\n(J) Cellular Distribution of the 2G7 and 7A9 Antigens: A variety of cells in primary culture were tested, with or without IL-1 pretreatment, for expression of the 2G7 or 7A9 glycoproteins. These experiments were performed in 96-well plates essentially as was done in the hybridoma screening assay. Specifically the indicted cell types were placed in 96-well plates. The following cells were seeded at the indicated concentration 24 hours prior to assay: fibroblasts, keratinocytes and HUVEC, 2 x 10\u2074/well; on the day of assay peripheral blood monoclonal cells were seeded at 5 x 10\u2074/well, granulocytes at 1",
    " prior to assay of antigen expression. \nThe results are shown in Table IV. \nTABLE IVCellular Distribution of the 2G7 and 7A9 (ELAM-1) ProteinsCell TypeAntibodycpm bound, no IL-1cpm bound, IL-1HUVEC2G71650 \u00b1 6247161 \u00b1 13677A91971 \u00b1 28159309 \u00b1 640Granulocytes2G71672 \u00b1 3511298 \u00b1 1577A91383 \u00b1 2951215 \u00b1 166Peripheral blood mononuclear cells2G72047 \u00b1 2951511 \u00b1 697A92210 \u00b1 3461575 \u00b1 37Keratinocytes2G7849 \u00b1 45813 \u00b1 297A9832 \u00b1 42800 \u00b1 29Fibroblasts2G7521 \u00b1 35511 \u00b1 167A9448 \u00b1 17513 \u00b1 22PlateletsMedium Only5688 \u00b1 2285736*2G75141 \u00b1 1555377*7A96241 \u00b1 366843*10E517267 \u00b1 7617455**Thrombin stimulation, 1 U/ml\n\nThe results in Table IV indicate that these antigens are not expressed at a detectable level on fibroblasts, granulocytes, unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, keratinocytes or platelets (with or without thrombin stimulation).

Specifically, HUVEC were expressed to various inducing agents as follows: gamma-IFN, 100 \u00b5/ml, 2.5 days; lps 1 \u00b5g/ml for 6 hours, TNF 1 \u00b5/ml for 4 hours; and IL-1 1 ng/ml for 4 hours. After washes to remove these agents, the indicated antibodies were tested at saturating doses for antigen expression in the plate-binding assay. \nThe results are shown in Table V and are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (n=3). \nTable VEffect of Various Agents on 1E7/2G7 and 7A9/3B7 Antigen ExpressionAntibodyIFN-GammalpsTNFIL-1Control181 \u00b1 19244 \u00b1 20644 \u00b1 42253 \u00b1 31E7818 \u00b1 443217 \u00b1 20712,726 \u00b1 3509,069 \u00b1 4572G7763 \u00b1 54684 \u00b1 29213,335 \u00b1 23210,483 \u00b1 11153B7nd*nd18,319 \u00b1 45021,595 \u00b1 22977A9ndnd20,067 \u00b1 40226,583 \u00b1 898HLA-DR5140 \u00b1 374178 \u00b1 12nd226 \u00b1 4*nd = not done\n\nAs has been shown previously for ELAM-1, lps and TNF stimulation result in the expression of the 1E7/2G7 protein. IFN\u03b3, however, after a 2.5 day incubation was ineffective at induction of 1E7/2G7, though HLA-DR was expressed as expected.\n\n(L) Surface Expression of the 3A2 Antigen: A flow cytometric analysis was conducted of endothelial cells pretreated for 4 hours with 1 ng/ml IL-1 and stained with 50 \u00b5g/ml 3A2 antibody. The cell number was determined in arbitrary units from the relative fluorescent intensities. For comparison the expression of the HLA and ICAM-1 antigens was also determined using the W6/32 anti-HLA antigen and the anti-ICAM-1 antibody RR/1. The flow cytometry was conducted as described above. The staining was conducted by conventional methods using FITC labeled antibodies. \nThe results are shown in Figure 23. Figure 23 shows quiescent (...) or IL-1 stimulated (-) endothelial cells stained with the indirect reagent only (Figure 23A), the W6/32 anti-HLA antigen (Figure 23B), the anti-ICAM-1 antibody RR/1 (Figure 23C) and 3A2 antibody (F",
    "T-cell adhesion structure. The immunoprecipitates were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. \nThe results are shown in Figure 24 wherein (-) indicates untreated and (+) indicates IL-1 treated cells. The results indicate that cells not treated with IL-1 show no ELAM-1 antigen, but that IL-1 treated cells precipitate a 110-120 kDa molecule reactive with the 7A9 antibody, as expected, and a 114 kDa protein reactive with the 2G7 antibody as shown above. The 3A2 antibody precipitates a 170 kDa protein in the absence and presence of IL-1. In addition the 3A2 antibody precipitates a faint band in the region of the 2G7 and 7A9 proteins only from the IL-1 treated cells. This result suggests that the 3A2 antigen complex might be composed of two proteins, or subunits, one of which is constitutive and the other inducible. While expression of the 3A2 antigen by IL-1 at the cell surface is inducible (Figure 23), expression of the antigen(s) in the cytoplasm might be constitutive.\n\n(O) Expression of the 3A2, 2G7 ind 7A9 (ELAM-1) Antigens at the Plasma Membrane Requires RNA and Protein Synthesis: Endothelial cells in monolayer culture in 96-well flat bottom plates were pretreated for 30 minutes with 1 \u00b5g/ml of cycloheximide or for 15 minutes with I \u00b5g/ml of Actinomycin D prior to the addition of IL-1. Drugs were left in cultures during the period of IL-1 activation. After 4 hours the cultures were rinsed and incubated with the relevant monoclonal antibodies in a plate binding assay as described above. Viable cells in monolayer cultures were examined for surface expression of these three proteins. \nThe results are shown in Figures 25; Figure 25A: IL-1 \u00b1 cycloheximide; Figure 25B: IL-1 \u00b1 actinomycin D (act D).\n\nFigure 25 shows that all antigens tested exhibited dependence of expression on RNA and protein synthesis.\n\n(P) Light Microscopic Evaluation of 3A2 Antigen: Quiescent and IL-1 stimulated endothelial cells were examined for cytoplasmic expression of the 3A2 antigen. HUVEC were cultured for 4 hours in the absence or presence of l ng/ml IL-1. The cultured HUVEC were detached by brief exposure to PBS-EDTA and cytospun onto glass microscope slides. Cells were fixed with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature and air dried to permeabilize the cells and stained with the 3A2 and 7A9 antibodies. \nFor staining, 100 \u00b5l of antibody containing 0.1 \u00b5g of antibody was placed on the fixed cells for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with PBS-1% BSA, and incubated with 5 \u00b5g/ml goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 minutes. After rinsing with PBS-1% BSA, the slide was incubated with chronogen AEC to develop color and counter stained with hematoxylin. Slides were viewed after mounting with a coverslip.\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 26. Figure 26A: no IL-1, stained with antibody 7A9; Figure 26B: plus IL-1, stained with antibody 7A9; Figure 26C: no IL-1, stained with antibody 3A2; Figure 26D: plus IL",

Cells were washed three times and lysed with 1% TRITON X-114 detergent containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM PMSF and 1 mM iodoacetamide.\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 29. Figure 29A shows results for \u00b3\u2075C-cysteine pulse labeled cells lysed after 45 minutes (first two lanes) or chased for an additional 1 or 2 hours, lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and 5, respectively. Figure 29B shows the results of cell surface iodination.\n\nThe results shown in Figure 29A indicate that 45 minutes after the addition of IL-1, there is nascent 7A9 (ELAM-1) protein which can be immunoprecipitated. Likewise, the same 79 kDa molecular mass protein is coprecipitated with CMP-170. When cells are pulsed for 2 hours and chased for either 1 or 2 additional hours, the 3A2 antibody continues to coprecipitate the same molecular mass material precipitated by the 7A9 (ELAM-1) antibody. Hence the CMP-170/ELAM-1 association is detectable from the earliest points of ELAM-1 synthesis until it reaches its mature size. The results shown in Figure 29B indicate that the 3A2 antibody also coprecipitates the 7A9 (ELAM-1) protein from the cell surface, although as can be seen, the 3A2 antigen does not itself appear to label very well.\n\n(S) Kinetics of Cell Surface Expression of CMP-170 and 7A9 (ELAM-1) Antigens: Endothelial cells grown to confluence in flat bottom microtiter plates were exposed to 1 ng/ml IL-1 for periods of time of from 0 to 48 hours and then tested in a plate binding assay analogous to that described above for hybridoma production for expression of the 7A9 and 3A2 antigens. \nThe results are shown in Figure 30. In Figure 30, the open circles represent the 7A9 antigen and the open triangles represent the 3A2 antigen. As can be seen from the results in Figure 30, the expression of both proteins occurs simultaneously, and peaks around 2 to 4 hours. However, the 7A9 (ELAM-1) antigen is maintained at high levels as long as IL-1 is present, while the 3A2 antigen declines to basal levels by 48 hours. Additional experiments (not set forth), indicate that CMP-170, like ELAM-1 is induced by exposure of endothelial cells to TNF and lipopolysaccharide but not gamma interferon.\n\n(T) Determination of Epitope of ELAM-1 to Which Monoclonal Antibodies 7A9 and 3B7 Bind and Preparation of Soluble Forms of ELAM-1: Figure 31 represents various truncated forms of ELAM-1 which were prepared in order to determine the epitope to which monoclonal antibodies 7A9 and 3B7 bind. The truncated versions of ELAM-1 were constructed by PCR as described in Section (C) of this Example using PCR primers that contained a stop codon, e.g., either TAA or TAG, at the 3' end of the deleted versions of ELAM-1 cDNA. Construction of such primers is conventional in the art. The COOH ends were chosen such that the truncated versions of the ELAM-1 molecule would contain lectin (L-ELAM-1), lectin plus EGF (LE-ELAM-1), lectin plus EGF plus part of the complement regulatory domains ",
    " a concentration of 1 ng/ml to cells in culture for 4 to 6 hours while the cells are maintained as usual in a humidified incubation chamber containing 6% CO\u2082, 94% air. Controls consist of culturing endothelial cells in the absence of IL-1. After the incubation period, cells are rinsed with medium to remove unused IL-1.</p>Mononuclear cells, e.g., monocytes, granulocytes or a mixture of mononuclear cells comprising T-cells, B-cells and NK cells, are obtained from humans and isolated and purified by methods known in the art.</p>The mononuclear cells are preincubated in the presence of antigen 1E7/2G7 or antigenic fragments of ELAM-1 for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The antigen is added in an amount sufficient to saturate the ligand binding sites on the mononuclear cells.</p>The mononuclear cells, in the continue presence of antigen, are then added to the endothelial cells for 30 to 60 minutes to allow attachment. The non-adherent cells are washed off by rinsing with growth medium, and the difference in the number of cells bound to endothelial cells (EC) untreated or treated with IL-1 is observed.</p>This assay is performed in a quantitative manner by incorporating a radioactive tracer, e.g., \u2075\u00b9Cr, by methods known in the art, into the cytoplasm of the cells whose binding was being studied, washing to remove any extracellular counts, and placing these labelled cells over the EC monolayer. The \u2075\u00b9Cr label used for this purpose should show minimal leakage during the 30 to 60 minutes of the binding assay. After rinsing to remove non-adherent cells, the monolayers are solubilized with detergent. The radioactivity counted from each well is a measure of the number of cells bound.</p>EXAMPLE 5cDNA SEQUENCE OF THE 1E7/2G7 ANTIGENRecently an adhesion molecule called VCAM-1 has been described (Osborn et al, Cell, 59: 1203-1211, 1989). Before attempting to clone the 1E7/2G7 antigen by cDNA expression cloning, VCAM-1 cDNA was cloned in order to determine whether the 1E7/2G7 antigen is related to VCAM-1 or not. VCAM-1 cDNA was cloned using poly A\u207a RNA from IL-1 dated HUVEC by PCR, as described in Example 4(C). The following PCR primers were chosen to only amplify the published coding sequences of VCAM-1 cDNA corresponding to a size of approximately 2.0 kb:<img id=\"ib0006\" path=\"imgb0006.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/179482856/EP/19940309/A1/000000/58/59/63/imgb0006.tif\"/>\n \u2007\u2007\u2007Instead of obtaining a coding sequence of approximately 2.0 kb, a 2.3 kb band was obtained as the major product of PCR amplification. The 2.3 kb band was cloned into the expression vector pCDN-1 as described in Example 4(C), and several clones were isolated. Five clones were tested for 1E7/2G7 antibody binding in a transient expression assay using COS cells, as described in Example 4(B-2). All five clones showed strong binding to monoclonal antibodies 1E7 and 2G7.</p>Restriction analysis, performed using conventional methods, of these clones showed a pattern that was differe"
