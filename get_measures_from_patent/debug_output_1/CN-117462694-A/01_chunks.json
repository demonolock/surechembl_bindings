    "fic examples.</p>Other materials, reagents, etc. used in the examples are commercially available unless otherwise specified.</p>EXAMPLE 1 preparation of nanobodies</p>The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain variable region of the anti-CD 30 nano antibody is shown as SEQ ID NO.1, and the nucleotide sequence for encoding the heavy chain variable region is shown as SEQ ID NO. 2. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain variable region of the anti-CD 5 nano antibody is shown as SEQ ID NO.3, and the nucleotide sequence for encoding the heavy chain variable region is shown as SEQ ID NO. 4. Nanobodies consist of only one heavy chain variable region, and thus the sequence of the nanobody, i.e. its heavy chain variable region sequence.</p>Recombinant plasmids were constructed separately to obtain His-tagged CD3 recombinant protein and CD5 recombinant protein, designated CD30-His and CD5-His.</p>The CD30-His and CD5-His are used as immunogens to immunize alpaca, immune alpaca peripheral blood mononuclear cells are separated, total RNA is extracted, cDNA after RNA reverse transcription is amplified by PCR, amplified fragments are recombined with phage plasmids, then phage display antibody libraries are constructed, and monoclonal screening is carried out on the phage nanobody libraries which are successfully constructed, so that anti-CD 30 nanobody (NbCD 30) and anti-CD 5 nanobody (NbCD 5) are obtained.</p>NbCD30 has very high affinity with CD30 protein, and has affinity constant (KD) of 4.17X10 <sup>-11</sup> The method comprises the steps of carrying out a first treatment on the surface of the NbCD5 has very high affinity with CD5 protein and has affinity constant (KD) of 6.30X10 <sup>-11</sup> All up to picomolar (pM) scale; nbCD30 and CD5 antigen are not combined, nbCD5 and CD30 antigen are not combined, the nanobody has very low off-target property, and the antigen specificity is strong.</p>EXAMPLE 2 prokaryotic expression vector construction and protein expression of nanobody conjugates</p>The invention prepares the nanobody coupling protein, namely the nanobody conjugate by coupling the nanobody NbCD5 and NbCD30 and granzyme B.</p>1. Construction of prokaryotic expression vector for expressing nanobody conjugate (protein)</p>(1) Construction of nanobody conjugates</p>Before a prokaryotic expression vector is constructed, human GrB (Escherichia coli codon optimization) is synthesized by genes, the GrB is a human GrB sequence (corresponding to amino acids 20-246 in GrB protein sequence) synthesized by genes, an N-terminal signal peptide and a GrB activation site (acidic dipeptide) are removed, the amino acid sequence of the GrB is shown as SEQ ID NO.5, and the nucleotide sequence for encoding the GrB is shown as SEQ ID NO. 6; nbCD30 (SEQ ID NO. 1) and NbCD5 (SEQ ID NO. 3) were passed (GGGGS) <sub>4</sub> Flexible peptide connection to obtain a bispecific nano antibody (NbCD 30-CD 5), wherein the amino acid sequence of the NbCD30-CD5 is shown as SEQ ID NO.7, and the nucleotide sequence of the coded NbCD30-CD5 is shown as SEQ ID NO. 8; the bispecific nanobody and GrB are connected through GGGSGGGGSGGGS flexible connecting peptide, and "
