To this end, MMTV-Mtdh transgenic mouse lines were generated (fig. 4A, 5A and 5B), and Mtdh transgene expression was observed specifically in the mammary gland and, to a lesser extent, in the salivary glands (fig. 5C). Next, these MMTV-Mtdh mice were incubated with PyMT; mtdh-/-mice crossed to generate PyMT with or without an exogenous Mtdh transgene; mtdh-/-mice (fig. 4A). Notably, transgene (Tg) rescued PyMT; mtdh-/-tumor expression and PyMT; that of Mtdh +/+ tumors (fig. 4B). And PyMT; mtdh-/-mice compared, observed from PyMT; almost two-fold increase in luminal cell expansion of Mtdh-/- + Tg pre-tumor glands (fig. 4C). Furthermore, in PyMT; in the Mtdh-/- + Tg group, tumor onset accelerated (fig. 4D) and tumor burden increased (fig. 4E and 4F). The presence of the Mtdh transgene did not alter the histology of the resulting tumor (fig. 5D). These results strongly support the tumor-inherent role of MTDH in promoting target cell expansion and subsequent breast tumorigenesis in vivo, although the contribution of tumor stroma cannot be excluded.</p><p id=\"p0181\" num=\"0176\">To supplement our spontaneous tumor model studies, it was next investigated whether acute manipulation of MTDH also affected the tumorigenic potential of pre-tumoral MECs. MTDH was from PyMT; mtdh +/+ (fig. 4G) and ErbB 2; mtdh +/+ (fig. 5E) females were knocked down in freshly dissociated pMEC in the pre-tumor glands. In both models, the sphere forming ability of MTDH knock-down (KD) cells was significantly reduced in multiple independent samples (fig. 4G and 5E). PyMT; in vivo tumor formation by Mtdh +/+ pMEC was also severely impaired by Mtdh KD (fig. 4H). Conversely, when MTDH is at PyMT; both in vitro spheroid and in vivo tumor formation were significantly enhanced when reverted to comparable levels in Mtdh-/-pMEC via lentiviral transduction (fig. 4I, 4J and fig. 5F-5H).</p><p id=\"p0182\" num=\"0177\">Next, whether TIC from established MTDH-positive tumors was dependent on MTDH for its functionality was analyzed (fig. 4K). The fact that tumors established from PyMT, Wnt and ErbB 2-driven tumor models exhibit a relatively homogeneous population when profiled with CD24 and CD29 (vaillent et al, 2008) highlights the need for additional markers to identify TICs from established tumors. Increased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity has been found in cancer stem-like populations in a number of cancer types including breast cancer (Ginestier et al, 2007), but its use as a TIC marker in mouse models remains less characterized. ALDH + and ALDH-cells were sorted from PyMT tumors (fig. 5I), and ALDH + cells were found to exhibit significantly higher in vitro spheroid formation (fig. 4L) and in vivo tumor initiating activity (fig. 5J) compared to ALDH-cells. Consistent with the population of ALDH + cells with TIC characteristics, the tumors generated from this population recapitulate (recapitula) the phenotypic heterogeneity of the initial tumors, with similar ratios of ALDH + and ALDH-cells. This indicates that ALDH + tumor cells are capable of self-renewal, as well as differentiation into ALDH-cells. When MTDH is in the form of PyMT; when knocked down in freshly isolated ALDH + cells of Mtdh +/+ tumors, sphere forming activity was significantly reduced (fig. 4M). For MMTV-Wnt tumors, the CD61+ population has been shown to have TIC characteristics and to be highly tumorigenic (valillant et al, 2008). Consistently, CD61+ tumor cells were able to produce a greater number of tumor spheres than CD 61-cells (fig. 4N). Importantly, MTDH KD impaired spheroid formation activity in CD61+ cells from MMTV-Wnt tumors (fig. 4O). These results indicate that MTDH is continuously required for full functionality of TICs in MTDH-positive tumors.</p><p id=\"p0183\" num=\"0178\"><u>The tumorigenic role of MTDH requires its interaction partner SND1</u>: SND1 has previously been identified as the primary binding partner for MTDH in human breast cancer cells, and it has a metastasis-promoting function similar to MTDH (Blanco et al, 2011). In this study, the interaction between MTDH and SND1 was found to be well-conserved in human and murine breast cancer cells.</p><p id=\"p0184\" num=\"0179\">To test the necessity of SND1 for MTDH function in tumor initiation, SND1 was first in PyMT; mtdh-/-tumor cells were knocked down and shown to rescue the expression of mouse Mtdh in these cells (fig. 6A). MTDH in PyMT; reintroduction in Mtdh-/-tumor cells consistently promoted in vitro sphere formation (fig. 4B) and in vivo tumor formation (fig. 6C); however, this effect of MTDH was completely abolished after SND1KD (fig. 6B and 6C). If MTDH did require SND1 for its tumorigenic function, knock down of SND 1in MTDH +/+ tumor cells would be expected to phenotypically mimic the effect of MTDH deficiency on mammary tumorigenesis. In fact, SND1KD in Mtdh +/+ tumor cells impaired both in vitro spheroid formation activity (fig. 6D) and in vivo tumor initiation (fig. 6E and 6F), similar to the effect of Mtdh abrogation on tumor initiation activity.

    "h SND1 (Blanco et al, 2011). This allowed us to use the SND1 \u0394 C fragment for the in vitro binding studies described below. To map the minimal SND1 binding domain of MTDH, a series of MTDH fragments within region 364 and 582 (fig. 7A) were generated and tested for interaction with SND1 \u0394 C. This led to the identification of a 22 amino acid fragment (residues 386-407) sufficient for SND1 binding (FIGS. 7A and 7B), which was also confirmed by the crystal structure of the MNDH-SND1 complex (see example 3).</p><p id=\"p0186\" num=\"0181\">To determine the key residues of MTDH that are essential for the interaction, three triple point mutants (called TPM) were designed, each with 3 amino acid mutations within the 22-aa minimal binding domain in the MTDH (amino acids 364 and 582 of SEQ ID NO:1) fragment (FIG. 7A). TPM1 contained mutations D389R, D393R and W394D. TPM2 contained mutations E399R, E400R, and W401D. TPM3 contains mutations W404D, D406R, and E407R. In vitro binding assays showed that neither TPM1 nor TPM2 bound SND1 \u0394 C, whereas TPM3 bound SND1 \u0394 C as efficiently as WT MTDH (fig. 7C). Mutations are also set forth in table 3.</p><p id=\"p0187\" num=\"0182\">TABLE 3</p><p id=\"p0188\" num=\"0183\"></p><p id=\"p0189\" num=\"0184\">To check whether TPM1 and TPM2 interact with SND 1in vivo, full-length HA-tagged SND1 and Myc-tagged MTDH were ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were subjected to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation. Consistent with the findings from the in vitro binding assay (fig. 7C), HA-SND1 was pulled down by WT instead of TPM 1or TPM2MTDH (fig. 7D). All 9 individual mutations were further analyzed using a similar strategy and W394D was found to completely abolish binding and W401D partially abolished binding, while other mutations individually did not affect the interaction (fig. 7E). Note that SND1 binding-deficient TPM1 and TPM2MTDH were still able to interact with AGO2 (fig. 7D), which AGO2 is another known MTDH binding partner (Yoo et al, 2011), indicating that these mutations are unlikely to cause gross conformational changes in MTDH, but rather selectively disrupt the interaction with SND 1.</p><p id=\"p0190\" num=\"0185\">Whether these mutations affect the function of MTDH in tumorigenesis was tested. Murine versions of WT MTDH, TPM 1or TPM2 in PyMT; mtdh-/-tumor cells were stably expressed, and these Mtdh mutants were found to lose the ability to interact with SND1 (fig. 8A). Functionally, the WT MTDH is able to increase PyMT; mtdh-/-cells had spheroid formation activity in vitro and tumor initiation in vivo, which was not achieved by TPM 1or TPM2 mutants (fig. 8B-8D). Similar results were observed when the W391D mutant (corresponding to W394D in human MTDH) was tested (fig. 8E-8H). These results strongly suggest that the binding residues of MTDH to SND 1are highly conserved in humans and mice, and that the interaction with SND 1is critical for modulating the functionality of MTDH in modulating TIC activity.</p><p id=\"p0191\"",
    "uce DNA replication stress (fig. 9B), a common stress type during tumor development (Halazonetis et al, 2008). CPT treatment induced apoptosis of MECs in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 9B). There was a significant reduction in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the MTDH rescue group compared to the control, and SND1 binding to the defect mutation abolished this pro-survival effect of MTDH (fig. 9B).</p><p id=\"p0192\" num=\"0187\">Consistent with previous observations that SND1 levels are critical for cell survival under stress conditions, as in PyMT; SND1 silencing in Mtdh +/+ MECs resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis after CPT treatment (fig. 9C). Interestingly, a drug dose-dependent decrease in SND1 protein levels was observed in MECs treated with CPT (fig. 9D). This phenomenon is not unique to this type of stress, as heat shock treatment also results in a rapid reduction in SND 1. Notably, in PyMT; mtdh silencing in Mtdh +/+ pMEC accelerated the reduction of SND1 protein (fig. 9D). In contrast, in PyMT; recovery of WT in Mtdh-/-MEC, but not SND1, binding to defective Mtdh stabilized SND1 protein under these stress conditions (fig. 9E). Thus, together, these data indicate that MTDH promotes survival under stressed conditions by interacting with the survival factor SND1 and stabilizing the survival factor SND 1.</p><p id=\"p0193\" num=\"0188\">To provide a better understanding of how SND1 exerts its pro-survival function, post-CPT treated controls were compared to SND1-KD PyMT; mtdh +/+ pMEC performed transcriptome profiling (FIGS. 9F-9H). The ingenity pathway analysis revealed genes upregulated by SND1 (fig. 9F, &gt; 2-fold change, p &lt;0.05) showing significant enrichment for molecular and cellular functions including \"cell death and survival\", \"cell cycle\", and \"DNA repair\" (fig. 9G), processes associated with CPT-induced replication stress. Interestingly, a significant portion of the SND1 up-regulated genes were implicated in the \"cell death and survival\" category, and expression of these genes together was predicted to significantly activate cell survival function (fig. 9H, top six rows) and impair cell death and apoptosis (fig. 9H, bottom two rows). Thus, the ability of SND1 to activate the pro-survival genes globally may be the basis for its role in protecting cells from stress-induced cell death (fig. 9C). To confirm the hypothesis that MTDH regulates survival by interacting with SND1 and stabilizing SND1, PyMT reconstituted with WT or SND1 binding defective mutant mouse MTDH (W391D); Mtdh-/-pMEC were profiled. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed that SND1 upregulated the gene marker in PyMT reconstituted with WT versus mutant Mtdh; significant enrichment in Mtdh-/-pMEC (fig. 9I).</p><p id=\"p0194\" num=\"0189\"><u>MTDH and SND 1are important for tumor initiating activity of human breast cancer cells</u>: to demonstrate the important role of both MTDH and SND 1in tumor initiating activity of human breast cancer, MTDH or SND1 ",
    "ent was frequently identified in TRAMP/Mtdh + mice (9/20), and the incidence was reduced to 30% in TRAMP/Mtdh-/-mice. To confirm that the metastatic cells were of prostate origin, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on serial sections of liver, lung and lymph nodes to detect T antigen oncoproteins. It was observed that the uniform expression of the T antigen oncoprotein was restricted to metastatic deposits rather than around normal cells, consistent with the tissue-specific pattern of PB-directed transgene expression (Gin)grich et al, 1996). Together, these data clearly show that Mtdh deletion in mice significantly reduces systemic metastasis in the TRAMP model. Notably, the observed metastatic differences between Mtdh + and Mtdh-groups are very likely to be underestimated due to the fact that close to 50% of TRAMP/Mtdh + mice died of large primary tumors and possible metastatic tumors before reaching one year of age.</p><p id=\"p0223\" num=\"0218\"><u>Mtdh knockdown in prostate cancer cells reduces in vitro proliferation and in vivo tumor formation</u>: since Mtdh is widely expressed in mice, the tumorigenic defect in whole-organism Mtdh-KO mice may result from Mtdh loss in prostate epithelial cells or other cell/tissue types. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the necessity of Mtdh in the tumorigenic capacity of the TRAMP-C1 cell line was examined, which is characteristic of advanced prostate tumors in the TRAMP model (Foster, 1997). Mtdh was Knocked Down (KD) (fig. 15A and 9B), and Mtdh-KD was found to reduce the in vitro proliferation of TRAMP-C1 cells (fig. 15C). To examine the consequences of Mtdh-KD in vivo tumor formation, we injected control and Mtdh-KD cells into the flanks of recipient mice and monitored the appearance of tumors over time. The appearance of palpable tumors was significantly delayed in the KD group (fig. 18D), and tumors excised from the KD group were much smaller than those from the control group (fig. 18E and 18F). Similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments. Interestingly, the tumors that eventually developed in the Mtdh-KD group expressed Mtdh levels similar to those in the control group (fig. 18G), which could result from clonal expansion of cells without Mtdh inhibition or from re-expression of Mtdh in Mtdh-KD cells.</p><p id=\"p0224\" num=\"0219\">Discussion of the related Art</p><p id=\"p0225\" num=\"0220\">Human prostate cancer is characterized by rampant recurrent amplifications and deletions, suggesting that there are still many uncharacterized genes controlling the generation and progression of this malignancy, along with some well-known genetic lesions, such as loss of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and p53 (Taylor, 2010). In the current study, it was demonstrated that MTDH is frequently overexpressed and amplified in human prostate cancer, and its expression level strongly correlates with disease progression and poor survival outcome. Furthermore, genetic studies using Mtdh-KO mice provided the first in vivo evidence: mtdh plays a key role in spontaneous prostate cancer progression and metastasis without affecting normal development.</p><p id=\"p0226\" num=\"0221\">The TRAMP model closely resembles human prostate cancer in that it spontaneously develops progressive prostate cancer that can metastasize to multiple different organs. Importantly, Mtdh levels are shown here to be elevated in both human and SV 40-driven murine prostate tumors compared to normal prostate tissue. Interestingly, Mtdh was recently found to be overexpressed by genomic amplification in a p 53/Pten-deficient metastatic prostate cancer mouse model in which telomerase activity was reactivated following telomere dysfunction (Ding,2012), suggesting that Mtdh can be activated in mice by a genomic amplification mech",

MTDH mutants W394A or W401A completely lost the ability to interact with SND1 (fig. 23A), indicating that the SND1 interacting residues of MTDH are well conserved between mice and humans. Functionally, in vitro mammosphere formation assays show PyMT reconstituted with mutant MTDH compared to those reconstituted with WT MTDH; mtdh-/-tumor cells formed significantly lower numbers of spheres (fig. 23B). To examine how MTDH mutations affect tumor formation in vivo, PyMT; mtdh-/-tumor cells were transplanted in situ into mammary fat pads of WT recipient mice. Discovery of MTDH mutantReconstituted PyMT; mtdh-/-tumor cells contained substantially fewer tumor initiating cells as revealed by the reduced tumor incidence when a limited number of cells were injected (fig. 23C). Furthermore, PyMT reconstructed from mutant MTDH; mtdh-/-tumor cells formed much smaller tumor sizes than those with WT Mtdh (fig. 23D-E). These results demonstrate that the interaction between MTDH and SND 1is essential for the tumorigenic activity of MTDH.</p><p id=\"p0263\" num=\"0258\"><u>MTDH binding deficient SND1 mutant is inactive in tumor promotion</u>: the well-defined pocket in SND1 for MTDH-binding and the role of this interaction in tumor initiation suggest that the protein pocket in SND1 represents a novel cancer therapeutic target. As demonstrated above, knock-down (KD) of SND1 impaired the tumor initiating activity of PyMT/Mtdh +/+ tumor cells, supporting the tumor promoting effect of SND1 (Wan et al, 2014). In the current study, shRNA resistance constructs of WT or mutant SND1(F250A or R255E) were stably expressed in SND1-KD PyMT/Mtdh +/+ tumor cells and tested for their effect on tumor initiating activity in vitro and in vivo. The SND1 mutation almost completely abolished the interaction with MTDH (fig. 24A). The SND1 mutant hardly caused any increase in the number of spheres formed in the in vitro mammaglobin assay, whereas the WT SND1 increased the number of spheres more than 2-fold compared to the control (fig. 24B). After cell transplantation into the mammary fat pad of recipient mice, WT SND1 significantly increased tumor initiation and tumor growth as reflected by tumor incidence and total tumor burden, while the SND1 mutant showed very little effect (fig. 24D). These results also support our conclusions: the interaction between MTDH and SND 1is important for tumor promotion, and both MTDH binding pockets in SND 1are critical for this activity.</p><p id=\"p0264\" num=\"0259\"><u>MTDH mutant deficient in SND1 binding failed to stabilize SND1 under stress</u>: these recent studies suggest that MTDH plays a key role in enhancing the stability of SND1 protein under stress conditions, which may contribute to the pro-survival effect of SND 1in cancer cells under oncogenic or other stresses (Gao et al, 2010; Sundstrom et al, 2009; Weissbach and Scadden, 2012).
