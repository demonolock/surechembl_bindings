    "at amount necessary or sufficient to eliminate, reduce or maintain a target of a particular therapeutic regimen. The effective amount may vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular targeted constructs being administered, the size of the subject or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art may empirically determine the effective amount of a particular compound without necessitating undue experimentation. In certain embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent for in vivo use will likely depend on a number of factors, including: the rate of release of an agent from a polymer matrix, which will depend in part on the chemical and physical characteristics of the polymer; the identity of the agent; the mode and method of administration; and any other materials incorporated in the polymer matrix in addition to the agent. </p>[00108] The term \"ED50\" is art-recognized. In certain embodiments, ED50 means the dose of a drug, which produces 50% of its maximum response or effect, or alternatively, the dose, which produces a pre-determined response in 50% of test subjects or preparations. The term \"LD50\" is art-recognized. In certain embodiments, LD50 means the dose of a drug, which is lethal in 50% of test subjects. The term \"therapeutic index\" is an art-recognized term, which refers to the therapeutic index of a drug, defined as LD50/ED50. </p>[00109] The terms \"IC<sub>50</sub>,\" or \u201chalf maximal inhibitory concentration\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. </p>[00110] Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising, specific components, it is contemplated that compositions also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components. Similarly, where methods or processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, the processes also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited processing steps. Further, it \n\nshould be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the compositions and methods described herein remains operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions can be conducted simultaneously. </p>[00111] It will be noted that the structure of some of the compounds of the application include asymmetric (chiral) carbon or sulfur atoms. It is to be understood accordingly that the isomers arising from such asymmetry are included herein, unless indicated otherwise. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically controlled synthesis. The compounds of this application may exist in stereoisomeric form, therefore, can be produced as individual stereoi"
