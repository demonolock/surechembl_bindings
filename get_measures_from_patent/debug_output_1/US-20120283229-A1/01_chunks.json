    "as incubated with 8 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 0.2 mM EDTA, 30 \u03bcM KEAKEKRQEQIAKRRRLSSLRASTSKSGGSQK, 10 mM magnesium acetate and [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP] (specific activity approx. 500 cpm/pmol, concentration as required). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the MgATP mix. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 \u03bcL of a 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10 \u03bcL of the reaction was then spotted onto a P30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting.</p>ROCK-II (h) Inhibition Assay:</p>In a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL, ROCK-II (h, amino acids 11-552) (5-10 mU) was incubated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 30 \u03bcM KEAKEKRQEQIAKRRRLSSLRASTSKSGGSQK, 10 mM magnesium acetate and [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP] (specific activity approx. 500 cpm/pmol, concentration as required).
