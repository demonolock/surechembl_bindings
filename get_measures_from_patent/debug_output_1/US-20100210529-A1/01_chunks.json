    "er MHC-binding properties and as such are scarcely expressed at the cell surface, 3) peptides with only a weak capacity to stably bind to class I MHC may form class I MHC-peptide complexes at the cell surface which quickly disintegrate and as such are not stimulatory to T-cells anymore (van der Burg S H et al 1996) and 4) proteosomal generation of CTL epitopes may be insufficient to generate effective numbers of MHC-peptide complexes.</p>PeptideTherefore, in a first aspect, there is provided a peptide derived from a protein that is ubiquitously expressed self-antigen and known to be associated with cancer, said peptide comprising an epitope exhibiting a low to intermediate capacity to form stable class I MHC-peptide complexes at the cell surface and/or being inefficiently processed by a proteasome and/or exhibiting a low to intermediate MHC binding affinity. Preferably, a peptide comprises an epitope exhibiting a low to intermediate capacity to form stable class I MHC-peptide complexes at the cell surface and/or being inefficiently processed by a proteasome.</p>In the context of the invention, \u201cexhibiting a low to intermediate MHC binding affinity\u201d preferably means that the relative binding affinity of an epitope contained in a peptide is comprised between 5 and 50 \u03bcM. More preferably, the relative binding affinity is comprised between 10 and 50 \u03bcM, even more preferably between 15 and 50 \u03bcM. The relative binding affinity is preferably assessed by a competition based cellular binding assay as previously described (van der Burg SH 1995) (see also example 1). The affinity of a given epitope present within a peptide is expressed as the epitope concentration to inhibit 50% (IC50) of the binding of a reference epitope. The length of the epitope is generally comprised between 8 and 12 amino acids in length and is typically selected based on typical anchor residues for HLA-A*0101, A*0301, A* 1101 and A*2401 (Rammensee H G et al). Preferred peptides are the ones as described in example 1.</p>In the context of the invention, \u201cexhibiting a low to intermediate MHC binding affinity\u201d is preferably measured by measuring the stability for binding to MHC as described in (van der Burg S H et al 1996).</p>Stability of other peptide-HLA complexes was preferably determined as follows. Peptide binding was performed at 4\u00b0 C. and 20\u00b0 C. and IC<sub>50 </sub>were determined. Peptides of &gt;50% of the initial complexes was lost within 2 hours were considered unstable. Stable peptides displayed IC<sub>50 </sub>at 20\u00b0 C. that deviated &lt;2 times of the IC<sub>50 </sub>at 4\u00b0 C. Peptides that displayed IC<sub>50 </sub>at 20\u00b0 C. of more than twice the IC<sub>50 </sub>at 4\u00b0 C. but IC<sub>50</sub>&lt;15 \u03bcM were considered to bind with intermediate stability. The rest was designated as unstable peptide binding.</p>In the context of the invention, \u201cbeing inefficiently processed by a proteasome\u201d preferably means that within the first hour of digestion by a proteasome less than 1% of total digested peptide is found. The processing by a proteasome is preferably assessed by incubating a purified proteasome, more preferably a human proteasome with a peptide comprising the potent",
    "ed expression of (amongst others HLA-A*0201-restricted) CTL epitopes generated via other routes than the proteasome (FIG. 2). Activation of p53-specific CTL may occur after uptake of tumor-derived p53 by peripheral APC. This results in the presentation of p53-peptides in the MHC class II pathway (van der Brug S H et al 2001 and Tilkin A F et al) and may also lead to presentation in MHC class I (Reimann J et al) (FIG. 2).</p>Concluding RemarksWe recently demonstrated that the efficient liberation of the exact C-terminus of putative CTL epitopes present in 25-30 amino acid long precursor peptides by 20S proteasomes, accurately identified natural processed peptides for which CTL are present in the peripheral blood (Kessler J H et al 2001). With respect to ubiquitously expressed antigens that as part of their normal regulation are degraded by the proteasome, some necessary differentiations should be made. A combination of a high capacity to form stable MHC peptide complexes and an efficient liberation by proteasomal digestion renders a peptide to induce tolerance. In contrast, peptides handicapped by either one of these two may form natural targets for CTL that made it to the periphery.</p>Material and MethodsPeptides, Peptide Binding and Stabilization AssaysPeptides 8-11 residues in length were selected based on typical anchor residues for HLA-A*0101, A*0301, A*1101 and HLA-A*2401 (Rammensee H G et al). The capacity of peptides to bind was tested in a competition based cellular binding assay as previously described (van der Burg S H et al 1995). FL-labeled reference peptides were synthesized as Cys-derivative (van der Burg S H et al 1995). Fluorescence labeled reference peptides used were: YLEPAC(FL)AK (HLA-A*0101) and KVFPC(FL)ALINK (HLA-A*1101) (Sette A et al), KVFPC(FL)ALINK (HLA-A*0301) (van der Burg S H et al 1995) and RYLKC(FL)QQLL (A*2401) (Dai L C et al). B-cell lines used are: CAA (A*0101), EKR (A*0301), BVR (A*1101), VIJF (A*2401). The relative binding capacity of the peptides is expressed as the peptide concentration to inhibit 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the binding of the reference peptide. Affinity is categorized as follows: good IC<sub>50</sub>&lt;5 \u03bcM, intermediate IC<sub>50</sub>=5-15 \u03bcM, and low IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;15-50 \u03bcM. Peptide stabilization for HLA-A*0201 was performed as previously described (van der Burg S H et al, 1996). Peptides of &gt;50% of the initial complexes was lost within 2 hours were considered unstable. Stability of other peptide-HLA complexes was determined as follows. Peptide binding was performed at 4\u00b0 C. and 20\u00b0 C. and IC<sub>50 </sub>were determined. Stable peptides displayed IC<sub>50 </sub>at 20\u00b0 C. that deviated &lt;2 times of the IC<sub>50 </sub>at 4\u00b0 C. Peptides that displayed IC<sub>50 </sub>at 20\u00b0 C. of more than twice the IC<sub>50 </sub>at 4\u00b0 C. but IC<sub>50</sub>&lt;15 \u03bcM were considered to bind with intermediate stability. The rest was designated as unstable peptide binding.</p>In Vitro Proteasome M"
