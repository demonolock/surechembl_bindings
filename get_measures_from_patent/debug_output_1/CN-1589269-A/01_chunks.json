The dosage form in which the compound is administered is determined by the route of administration. Dosage forms of the compounds include, but are not limited to, capsules and tablets (for oral and rectal administration), liquid dosage forms (for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraocular, intranasal, inhalational and transdermal administration) and sustained release microcarriers (for rectal, intramuscular or intravenous administration). The formulations also contain a physiologically acceptable vehicle and optionally adjuvants, flavoring agents, colors and preservatives. Suitable physiologically acceptable vehicles include, for example, saline, sterile water, ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The specific dosage of the active ingredient depends on several factors including, for example, the biological activity of the specific formulation, the age, weight, sex and health of the individual to be treated.</p>The following examples are given for the purpose of illustration only and to provide a more thorough understanding of the present invention.
