Evaluation of in vitro Activity: the in vitro enzymology level detection method adopts a PD-1/PD-L1 binding assay kit of Cisbio company.</p><p id=\"p0204\" num=\"0201\">Principle and method for screening PD-1/PD-L1 small molecule inhibitor</p><p id=\"p0205\" num=\"0202\">1) The principle is as follows: PD-1 protein is provided with HIS label, ligand PD-L1 of PD-1 is provided with hFc label, anti-hFc antibody labeled by Eu and anti-HIS antibody labeled by XL665 are respectively combined with the two label proteins, after laser excitation, energy can be transferred from donor Eu to acceptor XL665, XL665 can emit light, and after inhibitor (compound or antibody) is added, the combination of PD-1 and PD-L1 is blocked, eu and XL665 are far away, energy can not be transferred, XL665 can not emit light.</p><p id=\"p0206\" num=\"0203\">2) The experimental method comprises the following steps: as a specific method, reference may be made to PD-1 of Cisbiothe/PD-L1 kit (cat # 64CUS 000C-2). Briefly, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate comprises a 384-well white enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate, wherein each well is added with 2 mu L of diluent or a target compound diluted by the diluent, then each well is added with 4 mu L of PD-1 protein and 4 mu L of PD-L1 protein, the incubation is carried out for 15min at normal temperature, and then each well is added with 10 mu L of anti-Tag1-Eu3 <sup>+</sup> And the mixed solution of anti-Tag2-XL665, incubating for 1h to 4h at room temperature, and detecting fluorescence signals at 665nm and 620nm by an Envison instrument.
