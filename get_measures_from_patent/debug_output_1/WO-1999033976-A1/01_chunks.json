When, conversely, it is obtained in a salt form, the salt may be converted to the free form or another salt by a per se known method or a modification thereof. The polypeptide of the invention as produced by a transformant may be treated, prior to or after purification, with an appropriate protein modifying enzyme for arbitrary modification or partial polypeptide removal. The protein modifying enzyme to be used is, for example, trypsin, chymotrypsin, arginine endopeptidase, protein kinase, or glycosidase.</p>\n  The presence of the thus-formed polypeptide of the invention can be detected, for example, by enzyme immunoassay using a specific antibody. The DNA coding for the polypeptide of the invention or the polypeptide of the invention can be used for \u00ae synthesizing a part or the full length of a ligand for a G protein-coupled receptor protein, \u00a9 searching for a physiological activity of the polypeptide of the invention, \u00a9 preparing a synthetic oligonucleotide probe or PCR primers, \u00ae obtaining a DNA coding for a ligand for a G protein-coupled receptor protein, or a precursor protein, \u00a9 developing a receptor binding assay system using a recombinant receptor protein expression system and screening for candidate medicinal compounds, \u00a9 obtaining antibodies and antisera, \u00a9 developing diagnostic agents using DNAs, RNAs, antibodies or antisera, \u00a9 developing central nervous system function modulators, circulatory function modulators, immune function modulators, gastrointestinal function modulators, metabolic function modulators or reproductive function \n\nmodulators, for instance, (9) gene therapy, and so forth.

Said agonists or antagonists can be used as an agent for preventing or treating various diseases. Referring further to the above-mentioned use \u00ae, the polypeptide of the invention or the DNA coding therefor is recognized as a ligand by the G protein- coupled receptor protein expressed in the central nervous system, circulatory system, immune system, gastrointestinal system, metabolic system or reproductive system, for instance, and, therefore, is useful as a safe and low-toxicity medicament. The polypeptide of the invention or the DNA coding therefor is associated with the modulation of central nervous system function, circulatory function, immune function, gastrointestinal function, metabolic function, reproductive function, etc. , and, therefore, can be used as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic agent for a variety of diseases, e.g. various types of dementia such as senile dementia, cerebrovascular dementia, dementia due to genealogical denaturation degenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Pick's disease, Huntington' s disease, etc. ) , dementia resulting from infectious diseases (e.g. delayed virus infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), dementia associated with endocrine diseases, metabolic diseases, or poisoning (e.g. hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, alcoholism, poisoning caused by various drugs, metal",

Thus, the concentration of the G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) or a salt thereof or a partial peptide derived from the G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) or a salt thereof in a test sample can be determined by contacting the test sample with the polypeptide of the invention. Specifically, the assay can be performed, for example by the per se known method described in the reference \u00ae or \u00a9 cited below or a modification thereof. \u00ae Hiroshi Irie (ed.): \"Radioimmunoassay\" (published by Kodansha, 1974); \u00a9 Hiroshi Irie (ed.): \"Radioimmunoassay, A Sequel\" (published by Kodansha, 1979). \n\n(3) Screening for compounds capable of modifying the binding between the G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) and the polypeptide of the invention, an amide or ester thereof, or a salt thereof (hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as ligand or ligand polypeptide for short)</p>\n  Compounds capable of modifying the binding of the ligand polypeptide to the G protei -coupled receptor protein (APJ) (e.g. peptides, proteins, nonpeptide compounds, synthetic compounds, fermentation products, etc. ) , inclusive of salts thereof, can be screened for by using the G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) or a salt thereof or said partial peptide or a salt thereof, or by constructing a recombinant receptor protein (APJ) expression system and using a receptor binding assay system in which said expression system is used. Such compounds include those compounds which are capable of exhibiting cell stimulating activities (e.g. promotor or inhibitor actions on arachidonic acid release, acetylcholine release, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, intracellular cAMP production, intracellular cGMP production, inositol phosphate production, cell membrane potential change, intracellular protein phosphorylation, c-fos activation, pH depression) via the G protein- coupled receptor (APJ) (namely G protein-coupled receptor agonists) and those compounds having no cell stimulating activities (namely G protein-coupled receptor antagonists). The term \"capable of modifying the binding to the ligand\" covers both the case where the binding to the ligand is inhibited and the case where the binding to the ligand is promoted.</p>\n  The present invention thus provides a method of screening for a compound, or a salt thereof, capable of modifying the binding of the polypeptide of the invention to the above-mentioned G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) which comprises, on the one hand, (i) bringing the \n\nligand of the invention into contact with the G protein- coupled receptor protein (APJ) or a salt thereof or a partial peptide derived from said receptor protein or a salt thereof and, on the other hand, (ii) bringing the polypeptide of the invention and a test compound into contact with the above-mentioned G protein-coupled receptor protein (APJ) or a",
