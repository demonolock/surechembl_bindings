    "ds that inhibit protein kinases that transduce cell cycle checkpoint signals, thereby sensitizing the cancer cell to DNA damaging agents. Such agents include inhibitors of ATR, ATM, the Chkl and Chk2 kinases and cdk and cdc kinase inhibitors and are specifically exemplified by 7-hydroxystaurosporin, flavopiridol, CYC202 (Cyclacel) and BMS-387032. \"Inhibitors of cell proliferation and survival signalling pathway\" refer to compounds that inhibit signal transduction cascades downstream of cell surface receptors. Such agents include inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases (including but not limited to inhibitors of Akt such as described in WO 02/083064, WO 02/083139, WO 02/083140 and WO 02/083138), inhibitors of Raf kinase (for example BAY-43- 9006 ), inhibitors of MEK (for example CI-1040 and PD-098059), inhibitors of mTOR (for example Wyeth CCI-779), and inhibitors of PI3K (for example LY294002).</p>The combinations with NSAID's are directed to the use of NSAID's which are potent COX-2 inhibiting agents. For pu\u03c6oses of this specification an \n\nNSAJD is potent if it possess an IC<sub>50</sub> for the inhibition of COX-2 of l\u03bcM or less as measured by cell or microsomal assays.</p>The invention also encompasses combinations with NSAID's which are selective COX-2 inhibitors. For pu\u03c6oses of this specification NSAID's which are selective inhibitors of COX-2 are defined as those which possess a specificity for inhibiting COX-2 over COX-1 of at least 100 fold as measured by the ratio of IC50 for COX-2 over IC50 for COX-1 evaluated by cell or microsomal assays.
