    "hemia vera erythroid progenitor cells can grow in vitro in the absence of erythropoietin due to hypersensitivity to insulin like growth factor I. Harrison 's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. 701 (15<sup>th</sup> ed., Braunwald et al. ed., McGraw-Hill, 2001). In AMM, the overproduction of type III collagen has been attributed to platelet-derived \n\ngrowth factor or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Id. at pp. 703; see also, Martyr_, Leuk Lymphoma 6:1 (1991). In some MPD forms, specific chromosomal changes are seen. For instance, nonrandom chromosome abnormalities, such as 20q-, trisomy 8 or 9 have been documented in a small percentage of untreated PRV patients, and 20q-, 13q-, trisomy lq are common in AMM patient. Harrison 's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. 701-3 (15<sup>th</sup> ed., Braunwald et al. ed., McGraw-Hill, 2001). Philadelphia chromosome is present in the bone marrow cells of more than 90% of patients with typical CML and some patients with PRV. See e.g., Kurzrock et al, NEnglJMed 319:990 (1988). The Philadelphia chromosome results from a balanced translocation of material between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22. The break, which occurs at band q34 of the long arm of chromosome 9, allows translocation of the cellular oncogene C-ABL to a position on chromosome 22 called the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). The apposition of these two genetic sequences produces a new hybrid gene (BCR/ABL), which codes for a novel protein of molecular weight 210,000 kD (P210). The P210 protein, a tyrosme kinase, may play a role in triggering the uncontrolled proliferation of CML cells. See e.g., Daley et al, Science 247:824 (1990). The risk of the CML type of MPD also increases upon exposure to ionizing radiation. Survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945 have had an increased incidence of CML, with a peak occurring 5 to 12 years after exposure and seeming to be dose related. Cecil Textbook of Medicine, pp. 925-926 (20<sup>th</sup> ed., Bennett and Plum ed., W.B. Saunders Company, 1996). Radiation treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and cervical cancer has increased the incidence of CML. Id The incidence of MPD varies depending on the form of the disease. CML constitutes one fifth of all cases of Leukemia in the United States. Id. at pp. 920. Approximately 4300 new cases of CML are diagnosed in the United States every year, accounting for more than half of MPD cases. (eMedicine website, myeloproliferative disease). PRV is diagnosed in 5-17 persons per 1,000,000 per year. Id. True incidences of PT and AMM are not known because epidemiological studies on these disorders are inadequate. Id. Internationally, CML appears to affect all races with approximately equal frequency. PRV is reportedly lower in Japan, i.e., 2 person per 1,000,000 per year.
