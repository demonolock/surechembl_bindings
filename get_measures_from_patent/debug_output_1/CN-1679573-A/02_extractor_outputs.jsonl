In addition, Trichostatin A shows anti-angiogenesis activity (people such as Deroanne, Oncogene 21 (3): 427-436,2002) with antiproliferative IC50 ' s be in low nM scope be feature.\n2. In the cell culture studies, Trichostatin A can fully suppress human coronary artery's smooth muscle cell proliferation, and antiproliferative IC50 is about 6nM in vivo.\n3. The anti-proliferative capacity of Trichostatin A and the resistance-hysteresis characteristic of cell cycle point mainly be aspect tumor cell with antiproliferative IC50 ' s be in low nM scope be feature (people such as Woo., J.Med Chem, 45:2877-2885,2002).\n\nNote that there are only three sentences that meet the criteria, and they all relate to Trichostatin A. The other sentences in the text do not provide specific numeric values with units for bioactivity metrics."}
