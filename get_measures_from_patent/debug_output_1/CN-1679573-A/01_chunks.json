    "ce acetylation and deacetylated between balance can finally influence genetic transcription, subsequently, as propagation path cell proliferation decide according to the significance degree of genetic transcription.Histone deacetylation has two kinds of general classification, RPd3-and Hda1-sample albumen.</p>Adaptable other medicine, medicament or chemical compound comprises other histone deacetylation inhibitor, and it comprises Trichostatin A, its analog and derivant and similar medicament.These medicaments comprise short-chain fatty acid, as butyrate, phenyl butyrate, and valproate, hydroxamic acid, as trichostatin, SAHA and derivant thereof, oxametacin, ABHA, scriptaid, pyroxamine and third rare amine, epoxy ketone-comprise cyclic tetrapeptide, as trapoxins, the HC-toxin, the chlamydocin/ seclin, WF-3161 and Cyl-1 and Cyl-2, non-epoxy ketone-comprise cyclic tetrapeptide such as FR901228 and apicidin, aniline, as MS-275 (MS-27-275), Cl-994 and other aniline analog and multiple structure class material are as depudecin and organosulfur compound.</p>Trichostatin A is the deacetylated inhibitor of histamine, and it can block the propagation that mainly is present in G1 and the tumor cell of G2 phase in the cell cycle.G1 and G2 phase are to be the phase of feature with the genetic transcription in the cell cycle.The anti-proliferative capacity of Trichostatin A and the resistance-hysteresis characteristic of cell cycle point mainly be aspect tumor cell with antiproliferative IC50 ' s be in low nM scope be feature (people such as Woo., J.Med Chem, 45:2877-2885,2002).In addition, Trichostatin A shows anti-angiogenesis activity (people such as Deroanne, Oncogene 21 (3): 427-436,2002).</p>In the cell culture studies, Trichostatin A can fully suppress human coronary artery's smooth muscle cell proliferation, and antiproliferative IC50 is about 6nM in vivo.Accompanying drawing 51 is in cell research, and Trichostatin A suppresses coronary artery smooth muscle cell figure.Therefore, the topical Trichostatin A is possible with the neointima formation that suppresses following blood vessel injury basically.</p>As mentioned above, rapamycin is by the mould genus hygroscopicity of chain bacterium macro ring triene antibiotic, at United States Patent (USP) 3,929, describes in 992.Have been found that rapamycin suppresses vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in the body.Therefore, rapamycin can be used for treating mammiferous endogenous vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, restenosis and angiemphraxis, the blood vessel injury of especially following biological or mechanicalness mediation, or under susceptible situation, this blood vessel injury that mammal is stood.Rapamycin plays the effect of inhibition vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and the endothelium that does not participate in blood vessel wall forms again.</p>Rapamycin works to suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by many mechanism.In addition, rapamycin reduces other effect that is caused by blood vessel injury, for example infects.The mechanism of action of rapamycin and multiple function are discussed in more detail below.The rapamycin of using among the application will comprise rapamycin, forms of rapamycin analogs, derivant and bonding FKBP-12's and have a allied substances with the same pharmacological char",
