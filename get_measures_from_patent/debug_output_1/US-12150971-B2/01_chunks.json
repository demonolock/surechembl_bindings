    "R primers were used for amplification, including forward sequences specific for hsa-let-7a-5p (5\u2032-GCCTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGTATAGTTA-3\u2032), hsa-miR148b-5p (5\u2032-AAGUUCUGUUAUACACUCAGGC-3\u2032), and U54 (homo) (5\u2032-GGTACCTATTGTGTTGAGTAACGGTGA-3\u2032). qRT-PCR was performed using Phalanx miRNA One Array\u00ae Profiling (Phalanx Biotech Group).</p>4. Cytokine Determination Assay</p>The THP-1 cell line was used as a cell model. THP-1 cells were differentiated by 50 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (SIGMA; P1585) for 24 h. After washing non-adherent cells with RPMI-free serum, 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (SIGMA; L2654) was used as a stimulator to mimic the inflammatory condition, and treatment of LPS 100 ng/ml alone in differentiated THP-1 cells was considered as the positive control. The cells were treated with the drug with or without the presence of LPS and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 6 or 24 h. The cell medium was then collected and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. The level of TNF-\u03b1 released by treated cells was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. The supernatants were analyzed in Nunc MaxiSorp\u00ae flat-bottom 96-well plates (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher; #442402) using a human TNF-\u03b1 uncoated ELISA kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Thermofisher; #88-7346). The OD value was measured with the Infinite 200Pro OD reader, using the Tecan i-control program at 450 nm and 570 nm wavelengths.</p>5. Inhibition of M<sup>pro </sup>Activity and Determination of the Half-Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)</p>To determine Mpro activity inhibition ability, Virofree was used as an inhibitor in an enzyme-substrate assay in which Mpro was cleaved at the cleavage site of the fluorogenic peptide substrate (Abz-TSAVLQSGFRK-Dnp) in PBS. Virofree was incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 3 min together with a fluorogenic peptide substrate in PBS, followed by protease addition and equilibrated at 30\u00b0 C. for 3 min. The fluorescence emission at 423 nm was detected by excitation at 321 nm using a luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS50B) [24]. The IC50 value was obtained from the following equation</p>v=v0(1+IC5\u20620n)/[I]nwhere v is the velocity at different concentrations of the incubated inhibitor [I], and v0 is the initial velocity without inhibitor incubation, whereas n is the Hill constant.\n\n6. Cell-Cell Fusion\n</p>Human lung cancer Calu-3 cells, used as recipient cells, were first seeded in a 12-well plate at 1\u00d7106 cells per well to form a single layer of cells. BHK-21 cells were seeded at 4\u00d7105 cells per well in a 6-well plate and transfected with EGFP and spike plasmids (the original Wuhan strain or Delta variant) at a ratio of 1:5 using Lipofectamine2000. After 24 h, EGFP-Spike BHK cells were harvested by adding 1 ml of cell dissociation buffer (5 mM EDTA in PBS) into each well to detach intact cells and resuspended in serum-free DMEM (Gibco). Transfected BHK-21 cells expressing both EGFP and spike genes were used as donor cells; were co-cultured in a single layer of Calu-3 cells, used as target cells, for cell-cell contact in the presence or absence of Virofree treatments and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 h. After 1 h, PBS was used to wash away unbound cells and replaced with a growth medium. Initial images of EGFP-positive cells, representing the binding efficiency, were acquired in five random fields using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70). The binding efficiency of EGFP-positive BHK-21 cells with Calu-3 cells in the control and Virofree-treated groups was quantified by counting the initial number",

Pseudo-Typed Virus Neutralization Assay\n</p>Neutralization assays were performed by incubating wild-type (G-SARS-CoV2-Pseudovirus WT, LumiSTAR), delta (G-SARS-CoV2-Pseudovirus, B.1.617.2, LumiSTAR) or omicron pseudoviruses (G-SARS-CoV2-Pseudovirus, B.1.1.529, LumiSTAR) with serial dilutions of compounds at the desired concentration in Opti-MEM. HEK-293T cells (1\u00d7104) stably expressing human ACE2 genes were seeded in 50 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM (Gibco) in each well of a black \u03bcCLEAR flat-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one\u2122) and cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2. The next day, each compound was serially diluted three-fold in Opti-MEM and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-typed lentivirus at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The tested drug was diluted three times until the lowest concentration was 1 \u03bcg/ml. The virus-compound mixture was transferred to the 293T/ACE2 cell plate with a final multiplicity of infection of 0.1. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) at 16 h post-infection and cells were cultured continuously for another 56 h. After incubating the infected cells at 37\u00b0 C. for 72 h, the GFP fluorescence in the cells was quantified in the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices).</p>8. Image and IC50 Fitting</p>After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 72 h, infected cells were stained with DAPI at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min. Then GFP-positive cells and total cell nuclei were detected using an ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices). Raw images (5\u00d75 sites, total 25 sites) were acquired using a 20\u00d7 water immersion objective lens, following by processing and stitching using the appropriate settings. Total cells (indicated by nucleus staining) and GFP-positive cells were quantified for each well. All analyses were carried out using the MetaXpress Cell Scoring module, counting positive cells and the total cell numbers at each site. After Cell Scoring analysis, the raw data were processed by Lumi-Vcal (LumiSTAR custom analysis software). Transduction rates were determined by dividing the GFP-positive cell by the total cell number. Relative transduction rates were obtained by normalizing the infection rates of the drug-treated groups to those of the PBS-treated controls. The inhibition percentage was obtained based on the assumption that the PBS-treated control induced 0% inhibition. The curves of relative inhibition rates versus drug concentration were plotted using Prism 8 (GraphPad). A nonlinear regression method was used to determine the drug concentration at which 50% of GFP (IC50) was expressed. Each drug was tested in triplicate. All SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed at a BSL-2 facility.</p>9. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</p>An additional experiment was performed using ELISA to evaluate the efficacy of Virofree in interfering with the binding of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein wild-type (Wuhan strain) or variants (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03bf) and \u03b4 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD domain to biotinylated human ACE2 recombinant protein. Firstly, each well of a 96-well plate was coated with 100 \u03bcl of spike protein (500 ng/ml; cat. GTX135972-pro, GeneTex, Taipei, Taiwan) diluted in coating buffer, consisting of sodium carbonate (15 mM), sodium hydrogen carbonate (35 mM), pH 9.6, at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The coated plate was then washed thrice with washing buffer consisting of PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (pH 7.4) and subsequently blocked with 250 \u03bcl of blocking buffer consisting of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0 C. The plate was washed thrice, then 100 \u03bcl of tested drug or inhibitor (10 \u03bcg/ml; cat. GTX635791, GeneTex, Taipei, Taiwan) in dilution buffer was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. 100 \u03bcl of biotinylated human ACE2 protein (10 ng/ml; cat. AC2-H82E6; ACRO Biosystems, OX, UK) was added to each well and incubated for another 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. The binding of spike protein and ACE2 receptor without drug or inhibitor was considered as positive control. The plate was then washed thrice with w",
    "88, and cytokines (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8) [62]. Some studies predict that miR-148a is a high potential candidate for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome through bioinformatics [63, 64]. Although the regulation among miR-148b-5p, let-7a-5p, and cytokine production was not elaborate, Virofree stimulated these two miRNAs' expression levels (FIG. 2A and FIG. 11) and reduced TNF-\u03b1 (FIG. 2C). In the above-mentioned evidence, Virofree demonstrated the multiple functions (miRNAs and cytokines) to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 pathological mechanism.</p>Furthermore, Virofree showed two additional functional properties including inhibition of M<sup>pro </sup>to stop virus replication and interruption of SARS-COV-2 S protein binding to ACE2 to block viral entry. The SARS-CoV-2 replica gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are required for viral replication and transcription. Functional polypeptides are released from polyproteins through the protein hydrolysis processes, primarily by M<sup>pro </sup>(also known as 3C-like protease). M<sup>pro </sup>digests polyproteins at 11 conserved sites. The functional importance of M<sup>pro </sup>in the viral life cycle and the absence of closely related homologs in humans [65-67], places M<sup>pro </sup>identified as a tempting target for antiviral drug design. The enzymatic assay showed that Virofree could inhibit M<sup>pro </sup>activity at IC<sub>50 </sub>of 19.71\u00b143.94 \u03bcg/ml (FIG. 2B).</p>The ELISA-based trimeric spike-ACE2 binding assay demonstrated that Virofree can block binding between ACE2 and several spike proteins, including wild-type, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03bf variants (FIG. 3). Additionally, the result also suggested that the inhibitory effect of Virofree against the spike protein might be related to the RBD of the spike protein. Among these variant spike proteins, the Delta and Omicron variants showed the most sensitive inhibition by Virofree (FIG. 3E, F).</p>The inhibitory activity of the wild-type spike RBD antibody against the Omicron variant spike protein was not observed. This observation is consistent with the recent report showing that COVID-vaccine protection is weaker against Omicron [68]. As a result, Virofree appears to show a broader spectrum against spike proteins derived from various variants compared with the target-specific RBD antibody. The results of the cell-cell fusion assay showed that the binding of Delta spike and ACE2 could be inhibited by Virofree treatment (FIG. 4C), which is in line with the results of the ELISA-based trimeric spike-ACE2 binding assay (FIG. 3E).</p>Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated syncytium formation could mean that virus-induced cell fusion facilitates viral genomes delivery to neighboring cells [69]. While examining the histopathologic lung sections from deceased COVID-19 patients, the prevailing existence of syncytia cells containing 2-20 nuclei was observed, indicating the correlation between syncytia formation and severe pathogenesis. Based on these observations, using spike-mediated cell fusion to validate drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a potent strategy [70]. The time-course experiments were conducted in both wild-type and Delta spike proteins (FIG. 15). Compared with the wild-type, the Delta strain showed higher binding ability at the initial binding step and faster fusion kinetics at the following time points. The Delta variant reached almost complete fusion within 2 hours; in contrast, the percentage of cell fusion in the wild-type remained relatively low. Therefore, we have illustrated the fusion results of the Delta variants at the time point of two hours, instead of four hours (FIG. 4B).</p>The results of the cell-cell fusion assay clarified the suppression of spike-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection by Virofree treatment (FIGS. 4B, 4C and 4E), implying that Virofree may not only interrupt the binding of variant spikes and ACE2 but also affect host protease-involved SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. In both ELISA and cell-cell fusion assay, Delta var"
