In some embodiments, the anti-HGF antibody is an anti-HGF antibody described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,718,174B2.</p>In some embodiments, the BIRC7 antagonist is an anti-BIRC7 antibody. Exemplary antibodies are known in the art.</p>In a further aspect, antibody embodiments, in particular, according to any of the above embodiments, may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections below:</p>Antibody Affinity</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22641 \u03bcM. In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER\u00ae multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u00ae) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bcl/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20\u2122; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p>According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CMS chips at \u02dc10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CMS, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p>Antibody Fragments</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032, Fab\u2032-SH, F(ab\u2032)2, Fv, and scFv fragments, and other fragments described below.
