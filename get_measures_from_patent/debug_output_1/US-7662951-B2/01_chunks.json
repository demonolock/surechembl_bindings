These plaques are characterized by dystrophic neurites that show profound synaptic loss, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and gliosis. A\u03b2 arises from the proteolytic cleavage of the large type I transmembrane protein, \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Kang et al., 1987, Nature, 325, 733). Processing of APP to generate A\u03b2 requires two sites of cleavage by a \u03b2-secretase and a \u03b3-secretase. \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP results in the cytoplasmic release of a 100 kD soluble amino-terminal fragment, APPs\u03b2, leaving behind a 12 kD transmembrane carboxy-terminal fragment, C99. Alternately, APP can be cleaved by a \u03b1-secretase to generate cytoplasmic APPs\u03b1 and transmembrane C83 fragments. Both remaining transmembrane fragments, C99 and C83, can be further cleaved by a \u03b3-secretase, leading to the release and secretion of Alzheimer's related A\u03b2 and a non-pathogenic peptide, p3, respectively (Vassar et al., 1999, Science, 286, 735-741). Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease is characterized by mutant APP protein with a Met to Leu substitution at position P1, characterized as the \u201cSwedish\u201d familial mutation (Mullan et al., 1992, Nature Genet., 1, 345). This APP mutation is characterized by a dramatic enhancement in \u03b2-secretase cleavage (Citron et al., 1992, Nature, 360, 672).</p>The identification of \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase constituents involved in the release of \u03b2-amyloid protein is of primary importance in the development of treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. Characterization of \u03b1-secretase is also important in this regard since \u03b1-secretase cleavage may compete with \u03b2-secretase cleavage resulting in changes in the relative amounts of non-pathogenic and pathogenic protein production. Involvement of the two metalloproteases, ADAM 10 and TACE, has been demonstrated in \u03b1-cleavage of AAP (Buxbaum et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem., 273, 27765, and Lammich et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 96, 3922). Studies of \u03b3-secretase activity have demonstrated presenilin dependence (De Stooper et a"
