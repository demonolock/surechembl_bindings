    "see table 1), an endogenous pro- angiogenesis factor that is important for normal growth and development but is also involved during unwanted and aberrant vascularization such as in cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In addition, the short peptides promoted VEGF binding to other cell types, promoted proliferation of endothelial and melanoma cells in vitro, and enhanced angiogenesis and cell migration in the presence of VEGF. These short peptides with pro-angiogenic properties are useful in promoting angiogenesis, such as in wound healing, tissue repair, fertility treatments, hypertrophied hearts, revascularization of tissue after disease and trauma (e. g. stroke, ischemic limbs, vascular diseases, bone repair), tissue grafts</p>12633479 6 \n\n and tissue engineered constructs. Further, because the peptides and peptide derivatives described herein potentiate the effects of VEGF, they are also to be considered for their effects on other activities mediated by VEGF. For example, VEGF is a neurotrophic factor that exhibits neuroprotective properties. The peptides and derivatives described herein are also useful for promoting nerve growth, neuroprotection, vasodilation, modulation of blood pressure, and treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p>[0005] In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated peptide fragment of a prominin-1 (prom-1) (SEQ ID NO: 36), the peptide having pro-angiogenic activity, and VEGF-binding activity as measured by, for example, an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay.</p>[0006] In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated peptide fragment of a prominin polypeptide, said peptide having pro-angiogenic activity, and binding to a pro-angiogenic factor.</p>[0007] In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated peptide fragment of a prominin polypeptide, said peptide having pro-angiogenic activity, and stimulating endothelial cell proliferation.</p>[0008] In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated peptide fragment of an extracellular domain of a prominin polypeptide, said peptide having pro-angiogenic activity.</p>[0009] In one embodiment, the invention provides isolated peptide fragments of a prominin polypeptide homologue. Homologs of prom-1 are found in zebrafish, Norway rat, house mouse, humans, nematode and fruit fly. In a particular embodiment, the prominin is human prominin-1 (Genbank Accession No.: NM_006017.1; NP_006008.1; AF027208.1; SEQ ID NO: 36).</p>[0010] In some embodiments, the isolated peptide fragments of prom-1 described herein are derived from the extracellular domain set forth in SEQ. ID. No. 1, 2, or 3.</p>[0011] In some embodiments, the isolated peptide fragments of prom-1 described herein comprise at least 6 amino acid residues, wherein the peptide does not include a full-length prominin polypeptide.</p>[0012] In some embodiments, the isolated peptide fragments of prom-1 described herein are conservative amino acid substitution variants. To the extent that a peptide is 12 amino acids or less, such peptides are at least 60% identical to a peptide fragment of prom-1, wherein the peptide variants bind VEGF and have pro-angiogenic activity as measured by an angiogenesis assay described herein. Further, to the extent that it is known that a given amino acid residue of a prom-1 peptide is critical for or implicated in binding, e.g., by mutagenesis or deletion assays, in one embodiment that amino</p>12633479 6 \n\n acid residue is not substituted. It is specifically contemplated, however, that some substitutions at such residues may actually enhance binding. Thus, one of skill in the art should consider carefully before modifying such amino acids. Substitutions or modifications to residues of this kind that maintain or enhance binding to VEGF or the biological properties of VEGF are also encompassed within the scope of the terms \"variant\" and \"derivative\" as used in reference to prom-1 peptides.</p>[0013] In one embodiment, the isolated peptide fragment of a prominin polypeptide, the peptide having pro-angiogenic activity, and VEGF-binding activity as measured by an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay, comprises at least 6 consecutive amino acid residues from e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, or 3. While any fragment of prom-1 that has pro-angiogenic activity is contemplated, fragments of 30 amino acids or less down to a minimum of 6 amino acids, e. g. 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, or 6 amino acid residues are of particular interest. Preferably, the isolated peptide is selected from the group consisting of : LCGNSFSGGQPS (SEQ. ID. No. 4) ; PNIIPVLDEIKS (SEQ. ID. No. 5); LCGVCGYDRHAT (SEQ. ID. No. 6); ITNNTSSVIIEE (SEQ. ID.

NO. 9) or a conservative amino acid substitution variant thereof that substantially retains pro-angiogenic activity and VEGF-binding activity. These peptides dramatically enhance angiogenesis in vivo and enhance cell migration in the presence of VEGF.</p>[0014] Alternatively, or in addition, such peptides or variants or derivatives thereof encompassed by the various embodiments described herein can bind VEGF and exhibit neuroprotective properties.</p>[0015] In one embodiment, the isolated peptide is a VEGF-binding conservative substitution variant of a peptide fragment of prominin- 1, the peptide having pro-angiogenic activity. The peptide can have one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. The variant peptide retains a pro-angiogenic activity that is at least 50% of the original non-substituted parent peptide as measured by an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay.</p>[0016] In another embodiment, the isolated peptide having VEGF-binding and pro-angiogenic activities is fused with a non-prominin-1 protein, or a heterologous peptide or protein, forming a fusion protein comprising a peptide fragment of a prominin- 1.</p>[0017] In yet another embodiment, the isolated peptide is a peptide mimetic of an isolated peptide having VEGF-binding and pro-angiogenic activities.</p>[0018] In yet another embodiment, the isolated peptide having VEGF-binding and pro-angiogenic activities is conjugated to a compound such as a polymer, for the purpose of improving serum half and pharmacokinetics in vivo.

The isolated peptide having VEGF-binding and pro-angiogenic activities is present in the context of a fusion protein. In one embodiment, the peptide is PEGylated.</p>[0019] The isolated peptide, variant, fusion protein, peptide mimetic or conjugate described herein enhances VEGF binding to endothelial cells, enhances cell proliferation, enhances angiogenesis in the presence of pro-angiogenic factors, and enhances cell migration in the presence of pro- angiogenic factors.</p>[0020] In one embodime",

The exact function of prominin is unknown although in humans, defects in PROMl, the gene coding for prominin, cause retinal degeneration.</p>[00115] Prom-1 expression is also associated with cancer; many leukemias express prom-1 as well as CD34. It is believed that colon cancer is initiated and propagated by a small number of undifferentiated tumorigenic prom-l+ cells. Prom-1 mRNA expression is increased in cancer patients with metastatic disease, specifically with bone metastasis. In addition, prom-1 mRNA expression seems to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.</p>[00116] One of the reasons why prom-1 can promote cancer and/or metastasis is that the intact full length prom-1 enhances the angiogenesis properties of VEGF and therefore is pro-angiogenic. This characteristic of prom-1 could certainly support the pathological angiogenesis associated with cancer and metastasis. Treatment options that specifically target the prom-1 protein and its</p>12633479 6 18 \n\n expression are currently under study and include blocking activity with anti-prom- 1 antibody and inhibiting expression by siRNA.</p>[00117] Provided herein are peptides derived from a prominin polypeptide that have pro- angiogenic activities.</p>[00118] Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention provide isolated peptide fragments derived from prominin- 1 (prom-1), the peptides having pro-angiogenic activity as well as VEGF-binding activity as measured by an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay. The pro- angiogenic activities include: promoting VEGF binding to other cell types, the other cell types including, for example, endothelial cells and melanoma cells; promoting cell proliferation of endothelial, as well as melanoma cells in vitro; enhancing angiogenesis in the presence of VEGF as assayed via a corneal micro pocket assay; enhancing endothelial cell migration in vivo in the presence of VEGF; and promoting neovascularization in vivo in the presence of growth factors as assayed in an ear wound healing assay as described herein.</p>[00119] In one embodiment, an isolated peptide with pro-angiogenic activity is derived from the full length human prom-1 (Genbank Accession No.: NM_006017.1; NP_006008.1; AF027208.1). However, under no circumstances does the term \"prom-1 peptide\" encompass the full length peptide. Rather, \"prom-1 peptide\" refers to a truncated peptide of prom-1. In other embodiments, an isolated peptide with pro-angiogenic activity is from homologous protein members of the prominin protein family (pfam05478:Prominin). Homologous protein members of the prominin protein family include known and identified proteins as well as predicted proteins from genomic studies. All members of the prominin family are predicted to contain five membrane spanning domains, with an N-terminal domain exposed to the extracellular space followed by four, alternating small cytoplasmic and large extracellular loops and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.

In yet another embodiment, the isolated peptide with pro-angiogenic activity has at least 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 consecutive amino acid residues of prom-1. In another embodiment, the isolated peptide has no more than 30 consecutive amino acid residues. In yet another embodiment, the isolated peptide has no more than 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, or 7 consecutive amino acid residues of prom-1. In another embodiment, the peptide has 50 or fewer consecutive amino acids and includes peptides with 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, and 30 consecutive amino acids of prom-1.</p>[00121] In one aspect, the isolated peptide with pro-angiogenic activity consists essentially of or consists of a peptide selected from the group consisting of : LCGNSFSGGQPS (SEQ. ID. No. 4) ; PNIIPVLDEIKS (SEQ. ID. NO. 5); LCGVCGYDRHAT (SEQ. ID. No. 6); ITNNTSSVIIEE (SEQ. ID. No. 7); DRVQRQTTTVVA (SEQ. ID. NO. 8); and CSFAYDLEAKANSLPPGNLRN (SEQ. ID. No. 9) or a conservative substitution variant thereof.</p>[00122] Encompassed herein is an isolated peptide that is a VEGF-binding conservative substitution variant of a peptide with pro-angiogenic activity as measured by an in vitro ELISA- based VEGF-binding assay as described herein. Conservative amino acid residue substitution is well known in the art. Conservative amino acid substitutions replace an amino acid with another amino acid of similar chemical structure. Examples of such substitution are glycine for alanine, leucine for valine, serine for threonine, and aspartate for glutamate. For example, SEQ ID NO: 4 can be altered to a peptide VCGNSFSGGQPS, LCANSFSGGQPS, or LCGNSFSAGQPS, or LCGNSFSGAQPS. In one embodiment, only one of the amino acids is substituted with a conservative substitution. In another embodiment, two substitutions can be made. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine, tyrosine. Conservative amino acid substitutions do not change the overall structure of the peptide nor the type of amino acid side chains available for forming van der Waals bonds with a binding partner. Conservative amino acid substitution can be achieved during chemical synthesis of the peptide by adding the desired substitute amino acid at the appropriate sequence in the synthesis process. Alternatively, molecular biology methods can be used. The coding sequence of a peptide described herein can be made by annealing two single strand nucleic acids that are complementary to each</p>12633479 6 20 \n\n other. The sequence of the nucleic ",
