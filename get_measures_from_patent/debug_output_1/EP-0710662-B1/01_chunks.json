Membrane preparation (5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor)The longitudinal muscle strip from guinea pig\nwas homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose with a Teflon-glass\nhomogenizer. After centrifugation at 900G for 10\nminutes, the upper fraction of lipids and precipitates\nwas discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at\n100,000G (48,000 rpm) for an hour. The pellet was\nresuspended in 50 mM HEPES buffer. After incubation at\n37\u00b0C for 30 minutes, the suspension was centrifuged at\n48,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The pellet was suspended in\nHEPES buffer supplemented with 10<sup>-6</sup> M pargyline and\n0.1% ascorbic acid. The suspension was used for the\nbinding assay. </p>2. Assay for the inhibition of 5-HT4 receptor-bindingThe membrane preparation was incubated at 25\u00b0C\nfor 30 minutes, together with 0.1 nM of [<sup>3</sup>H]GR113808\n(Amersham, selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor binding agent) and\nthe sample compound at the final concentration of 1.0 ml\nin the sample compound. Non-specific binding was\ndefined as that taken in the presence of 3 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M 5-HT.\nB/F separation was performed through GF/B filter\ntreated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine, using a cell\nharvester. Washing was performed once.</p>3.

Non-specific binding was defined as the\nbinding taken in the presence of 1 \u00b5M zacopride.</p>3) Serotonin <sub>1A</sub> receptorThe affinity to serotonin <sub>1A</sub> (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptor\nwas examined by the method described in SCHLEGEL, J.R.\net al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 12, 1943-1949 (1986).</p>The affinity to serotonin <sub>1A</sub> (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) was\nexamined in terms of inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT\n(Daiichi Kagaku Yakuhin Co.) binding to rat cerebral\ncortex membrane. The rat cerebral cortex was\nhomogenized in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.4)\nfollowed by centrifugation at 48,000G.</p>The pellet was washed once with Tris\nhydrochloride buffer. Then the pellet was suspended in\n50 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer (supplemented with 0.01\nmM pargyline and 0.1% ascorbic acid, pH 7.7) and\nprovided for use as the membrane preparation. The\nmembrane specimen was reacted with 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT\nat 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. After the reaction, the\nmembrane was caught by a harvester.

Gastrointestinal motor activityThe gastrointestinal motor-enhancing activity\nby the quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives of the\npresent invention was examined by a modification of the\nmethod described in YOSHIDA, N. and ITO, T., The Journal\nof Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 257, 781-787\n(1991): \"AS-4370, a new gastrokinetic agent,\nenhances upper gastrointestinal motor activity in\nconscious dogs\".</p>Method:Model dog was prepared and the assay was\nperformed, by a modification of the method by Yoshida et\nal. For the assay, female beagle dog was used. The\nanimal was anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg,\ni.v.) and the abdominal cavity was opened.
