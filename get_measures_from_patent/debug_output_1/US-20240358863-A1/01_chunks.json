    "crude complex of formula (II) is heated to 30\u00b0 C. The nanofilter is filled with said solution. The pump is switched on first at a low rate to purge the system, then the rate of the nanofilter pump is gradually increased to the desired recirculation rate (1.0 m<sup>3</sup>/h for a membrane of 2.5\u00d740 inches). The system is then placed in total recirculation at 30\u00b0 C. for at least 2 hours to establish a polarization layer. The medium is then passed to diafiltration at 30\u00b0 C. under 2.5 bar while keeping the volume constant by adding pure water until a conductivity of the retentate of less than 1000 \u03bcS is obtained. At the end of diafiltration, the medium is concentrated to obtain a concentration of about 40% (m/m).</p>Treatment on ResinsThe solution of complex of formula (II) obtained from the nanofiltration is diluted with purified water with stirring to obtain a 15% solution (m/m). This solution is eluted in series on 50 litres of strong anionic resins (FPA900) in OH<sup>\u2212</sup> form and then on 50 litres of weak cationic resins (HP336) in H<sup>+</sup> form at a mean elution flow rate of 2V/V/H (2 volumes of solution per volume of resin per hour). The resins are then rinsed with about 450 litres of purified water until a refractive index of less than 1.3335 is obtained.</p>The solution of complex of formula (II) is then concentrated by heating to 50-60\u00b0 C. under a vacuum of 20 mbar to reach a concentration of 35% (m/m).</p>UltrafiltrationThe ultrafiltration membrane is a UF 10 KD Koch Spiral membrane.</p>The ultrafilter is fed with the preceding solution of complex of formula (II) at 35% heated to 40\u00b0 C. The ultrafiltration is applied at a flow rate of 3 m<sup>3</sup>/h with a transmembrane pressure of 2.5-3 bar. The system is rinsed several times with 13 litres of apyrogenic purified water until a final dilution of the complex of formula (II) of 25% (m/m) is reached.</p>AtomizationThe complex of formula (II) is obtained in powder form by atomization of the preceding solution of complex of formula (II) concentrated to 25%.</p>The atomization is performed in the following manner:</p>The atomizer is equilibrated with apyrogenic pure water by setting the inlet temperature to 165\u00b0 C.-170\u00b0 C. and adapting the feed rate such that the outlet temperature is between 105 and 110\u00b0 C.</p>The concentrated solution of complex of formula (II) is then added and the flow rate is adjusted so as to conserve the above parameters.</p>These operating conditions are maintained throughout the atomization, while ensuring good behaviour of the powder in the atomization chamber and at the atomizer outlet. It should notably be ensured that there is no adhesion of the product.</p>At the end of feeding the atomizer with the solution, the container of this complex of formula (II) and the atomizer are rinsed with apyrogenic pure water until maximum recovery of the powder is obtained.</p>A 99.6% pure complex of formula (II) is obtained.</p>This degree of purity was determined by r"
