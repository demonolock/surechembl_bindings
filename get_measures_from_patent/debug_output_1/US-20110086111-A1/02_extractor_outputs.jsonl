{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. Synthetic peptide, designated EPPT1 (YCAREPPTRTFAYWG; SEQ ID NO: 11), has been developed as specific ligands and has shown significant affinity (Kd=20 \u03bcM).\n2. The conformationally restrained RGD sequence, i.e. cyclic RGD, contains disulfide bridges and binds to \u03b1V\u03b23 20-40 fold more avidly than linear RGD peptides (Koivunen, E., Wang, B. & Ruoslahti, E., Biotechnology (N.Y.), 13: 265-270 (1995)) with a binding affinity of (Kd not explicitly stated but implied to be in the range of 20-40 fold more avidly than linear RGD peptides).\n3. Cellular uptake of folates is facilitated by either a low affinity reduced folate carrier (Km\u02dc1 \u03bcM), which is present in virtually all cells of the body, or a high affinity glycosylphosphatidylinositol- linked folate receptor (FR) (KD=\u02dc100 pM), which exhibits highly limited distribution.\n\nNote that sentence 2 does not explicitly state the Kd value, but it implies a comparison with linear RGD peptides. If you want to exclude this sentence, the revised list would be:\n\n1. Synthetic peptide, designated EPPT1 (YCAREPPTRTFAYWG; SEQ ID NO: 11), has been developed as specific ligands and has shown significant affinity (Kd=20 \u03bcM).\n2. Cellular uptake of folates is facilitated by either a low affinity reduced folate carrier (Km\u02dc1 \u03bcM), which is present in virtually all cells of the body, or a high affinity glycosylphosphatidylinositol- linked folate receptor (FR) (KD=\u02dc100 pM), which exhibits highly limited distribution."}
