    "rmal cell are masked. This feature makes it possible to design probes that discriminate between normal cells and adenocarcinoma cells.</p>Fourth, the extracellular domain of mucin-1, defined by the presence of the APDTRP (SEQ ID NO: 10) sequence, extends above the cell surface, thus interfering with the interaction between adhesion molecules on the tumor cell surface and their ligands on lymphocytes, aiding in the inaccessibility of tumor epitopes to immune recognition. Therefore, there is no tendency for tumor antigen down-regulation in response to immunotherapy, and mucin-1 expression remains homogeneously up-regulated during the life of the tumor and tumor metastases. These features are important in designing targeted drug delivery for different stages of tumor progression.</p>An abundant number of investigations have focused on the potential to use mucin-1 as a target for immunotherapy. Multiple monoclonal antibodies have been produced to recognize the immunogenic APDTRP (SEQ ID NO: 10) sequence of the tandem repeat. However, when antibodies were used as targeting molecules, the immunogenicity and long plasma half-life of these proteins were detrimental. Consequently, the use of small peptides instead may eliminate these shortcomings because peptide ligands are nonimmunogenic and have high affinity and selectivity for receptors. Synthetic peptide, designated EPPT1 (YCAREPPTRTFAYWG; SEQ ID NO: 11), has been developed as specific ligands and has shown significant affinity (Kd=20 \u03bcM). EPPT1 peptide, labeled with (99mTc), has been used to image breast carcinomas in vivo. All of the features of the mucin-1 protein listed above make this molecule an ideal candidate for a potential tumor targeting ligand.</p>A number of tumor cell and associated vasculature specific receptors have also been identified that differentiate tumor cells from normal cells. The \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin is one of the most studied and is selectively overexpressed in tumor associated neovasculature as well as in certain metastatic cancers (Felding-Habermann et al., Clin. Exp. Metastasis, 19: 427-436 (2002)). High affinity \u03b1V\u03b23 selective ligands containing the tripeptide sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), have been identified by phage display studies. The conformationally restrained RGD sequence, i.e. cyclic RGD, contains disulfide bridges and binds to \u03b1V\u03b23 20-40 fold more avidly than linear RGD peptides (Koivunen, E., Wang, B. &amp; Ruoslahti, E., Biotechnology (N.Y.), 13: 265-270 (1995)). RGD peptide has been conjugated with doxorubicin (Arap, W., Pasqualini, R. &amp; Ruoslahti, E., Science, 279: 377-380 (1998)) for targeted chemotherapy as well as for targeted radiotherapy (Capello, A. et al., J. Nucl. Med., 45: 1716-1720 (2004)). They have been conjugated to humanized antibodies, liposomes, poly (ethylene glycol) and HPMA copolymers to improve biodistribution and increase tumor accumulation and antitumor efficacy. These studies make RGD and cyclic RGD an ideal targeting ligand for studying anti-tumor drug targeting.</p>Folic acid and its reduced counterparts are required by eukaryotic cells for one carbon transferreactions used in the biosynthesis of nucleotide bases. Cellular uptake of folates is facilitated by either a low affinity reduced folate carrier (Km\u02dc1 \u03bcM), which is present in virtually all cells of the body, or a high affinity glycosylphosphatidylinositol- linked folate receptor (FR) (KD=\u02dc100 pM), which exhibits highly limited distribution. FRs exhibit limited expression on healthy cells, but are often present in large numbers on cancer cells. For example, FRs are overexpressed on epithelial cancers of the ovary, mammary gland, colon, lung, prostate, nose, throat, and brain. FRs are also overexpressed on hematopoietic malignancies of myeloid origin, including chronic and acute myelogenous leukemias. A strong correlation has been observed between FR expression and the grade and histological stage of a tumor. A variety of folate linked molecules and complexes have been designed to enable selective delivery of drugs to FRs on cancer cells and activated macrophages. Other features that render folic acid an attractive ligand for use in drug targeting include its low molecular weight (MW 441), water solubility, stability to diverse solvents, pHs, and heat, facile conjugation chemistry, lack of immunogenicity, and high affinity for its receptor.</p>In some embodiments that include a targeting ligand, the targeting ligand may be RGDfK, EPPT1, or folate. In some embodiments, the targeting ligand is attached to the carrier polymer by a linker, which is an amino acid or peptide. In some embodiments, the linker is a peptide comprising Gly-Gly.</p>5.
