In a 96 well format using a modified antibody capture technique (DeLapp et al., 1999), measure GTP- \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding. Briefly incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature the GTP-binding assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4), the CHO or Sf9 cell membranes expressing CBi or CB<sub>2</sub>, (Applied Cell Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA; prepare membranes as previously described (DeLapp et al., 1999)), Example 2 and the 500 pM GTP-\u03b3-<sup>35</sup>S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Perform antagonist dose reponses in the presence of a saturating dose of a full agonist (methanandamide). To the 96 well plate, in addition, add a mixture containing 0.27% Nonidet P40 detergent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), anti-Gi antibody (final dilution of 1 :300; Covance, Princeton, NJ), and 1.25 mg anti-rabbit antibody scintillation proximity assay beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and seal the plates and incubate for an additional 3 hours. Centrifuge the plates at 700 x g for 10 minutes using a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge and count for 1 minute per well using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA).</p>To analyze data, subtract background from all wells. Determine percent agonist efficacy by normalizing agonist/inverse agonist dose response data to a full agonist (methanandamide) response. Calculate antagonist percent inhibition data by normalizing to results generated with a saturating concentration of agonist (methanandamide). Analyze the data using a 4-parameter logistic reduced fit with Activity Base and XLFit3 (IDBS, Emeryville, CA). Determine Kb values using a modification of the Cheng-Prusoff relationship: Kb = IC50/(l + [agonist]/EC50) where IC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of displacement curves, [agonist] = EC50 of full agonist, and EC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of a full agonist concentration response curve \n\n (Cheng and Prusoff 1973). Calculate mean Kb values as a mean of at least three independent determinations \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>Table 1 summarizes the antagonist/inverse agonist properties of Example 2 in CHO cells expressing human or rat CBi receptors or Sf9 cells expressing human CB<sub>2</sub> receptors. It is concluded Example 2 exhibits potent human and rat CBi antagonism with no measurable antagonism of the human CB<sub>2</sub> receptor. The data indicates Example 2 is a potent CBi antagonist/inverse agonist at both rat and human receptors with no antagonism of human CB<sub>2</sub> receptors.</p>Table 2 summarizes the agonist properties of Example 2 in Sf9 cell membranes from cells expressing human CBi or CB<sub>2</sub> receptors. These data demonstrate that Example 2 is an inverse agonist at the human CBi receptor as evidenced by agonist efficacy (Table 2) less than zero which indicates that the compound decreased basal constitutive activity of the CBi receptor in vitro. Example 2 does not have any measurable CB<sub>2</sub> agonist activity (Table T).</p>References:</p>DeLapp NW, McKinzie JH, Sawyer BD, Vandergriff A, Falcone J, McClure D and Felder CC (1999).
