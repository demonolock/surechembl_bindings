The Sequence Listing XML file, created on July 28, 2023, is named 180802-055202PCT_SL.xml and is 1,004,894 bytes in size. </p>15 BACKGROUND </p>Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis- 10 (LCA10) is a rare congenital eye disease that appears at birth or in the first few months of life. It affects about 1 in 40,000 newborns. The disease primarily affects the retina. People with the disease typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy, and the impairment can worsen progressively over time. </p>20 Typically, LCA10 leads to progressive loss of all vision. There is a need for improved compositions and methods for treating LCA10. </p>SUMMARY </p>As described below, the invention features compositions and methods for editing a</p>25 290-KD centrosomal protein (CEP290) gene to treat a congenital eye disorder, such as Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis-10 (LCA10). In embodiments, the disclosure provides methods for direct correction of the IVS26 pathogenic mutation in the CEP290 gene (CEP290 c.2991+1655A&gt;G) and/or disruption of a cryptic splice donor site within an intron of the CEP290 gene using a base editor (e.g., a cytidine deaminase base editor, an adenosine</p>30 deaminase base editor, or a cytidine adenosine deaminase base editor (CABE)). </p>In one aspect, the invention features a method of editing a nucleobase of a 290-KD centrosomal protein (CEP290) polynucleotide in a cell. The method involves contacting the cell with a base editor polypeptide containing (a) a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp) domain and a deaminase domain, or (b) one or more polynucleotides </p>1 \n\n encoding the base editor. The method further involves contacting the cell with one or more guide polynucleotides, or one or more polynucleotides encoding the one or more guide polynucleotides, where the guide polynucleotides target the base editor to effect an alteration of the nucleobase of the CEP290 polynucleotide in the cell. </p>5 In another aspect, the invention features a method of treating Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis-10 (LCA10) in a subject in need thereof, the method involves contacting a cell in the subject with a base editor polypeptide containing (a) a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp) domain and a deaminase domain, or (b) one or more polynucleotides encoding the base editor. The method further involves contacting the cell</p>10 with one or more guide polynucleotides, or one or more polynucleotides encoding the one or more guide polynucleotides, where the guide polynucleotides target the base editor to effect an alteration of a nucleobase of a 290-KD centrosomal protein (CEP 290) polynucleotide in the cell, thereby treating LCA10 in the subject. </p>In another aspect, the invention features a modified cell containing an alteration in a</p>15 nucleobase of a CEP290 polynucleotide. The alteration increases expression and/or activity of the encoded CEP290 polypeptide as compared to a control cell without the alteration. The cell is prepared according to the method of any one of the above aspects, or embodiments thereof. </p>In another aspect, the invention features a base editor system containing two </p>20 polynucleotides together encoding a base editor polypeptide. The base editor polypeptide contains a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp) domain and a deaminase domain. A first polynucleotide encodes a fusion protein containing an N-terminal fragment of the base editor fused to a split intein-N. A second polynucleotide encodes a fusion protein containing the remaining C-terminal fragment the base editor fused to a split</p>25 intein-C. The base editor system also contains one or more guide polynucleotides, or one or more polynucleotides encoding the one or more guide polynucleotides, where the one or more guide polynucleotides contain a spacer containing at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a spacer corresponding to a nuelcic acid sequence selected from one or more of: AUACUCACAAUUACAAC (SEQ ID NO: 459); GAUACUCACAAUUACAAC (SEQ ID NO: 460);</p>30 AGAUACUCACAAUUACAAC (SEQ ID NO: 461); GAGAUACUCACAAUU",

In embodiments, the disclosure provides methods for direct correction of the IVS26 pathogenic mutation in the CEP290 gene (CEP 290 c.2991+1655A&gt;G) and/or </p>50 \n\n disruption of a cryptic splice donor site within an intron of the CEP290 gene using a base editor (e.g., a cytidine deaminase base editor, an adenosine deaminase base editor, or a cytidine adenosine deaminase base editor (CABE)). </p>The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery, as shown in the Examples</p>5 provided herein below, that base editors can be used to directly correct the IVS26 pathogenic mutation in the CEP290 gene (CEP290 C.2991+1655AX3) and/or disruption of a cryptic splice donor site within an intron of an CEP290 gene to treat Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis. In particular, it was found that precise correction of the IVS26 pathogenic mutation can be achieved using a cytidine deaminase base editor (e.g., a base editor containing a rAPOBEC,</p>10 ppAPOBEC, RrA3F, AmAPOBECl, or SsAPOBEC3B cytidine deaminase domain) with limited bystander edits and with editing efficiencies of about 75% in vitro. It was also found that disruption of a cryptic splice site associated with the IVS26 pathogenic mutation could be achieved using a cytidine deaminase base editor (e.g., a base editor containing a rAPOBEC, ppAPOBEC, RrA3F, AmAPOBECl, or SsAPOBEC3B cytidine deaminase</p>15 domain) with e",
    " base editor or disruption of the cryptic \u201cGT\u2019 splice donor site (FIG. 2B) using an adenosine deaminase base editor or a cytidine deaminase base editor. A cytidine deaminase base editor can be</p>15 used to deaminate the cytidine (C) complementary to the pathogenic guanine (G) to result in a reversion to adenine (i.e., C.2991+1665A). A cytidine deaminase base editor or an adenosine deaminase base editor can be used to alter the cryptic \u201cGT\u2019 splice donor site upstream of the c.2991+1665A&gt;G mutation. In some embodiments, a base editor may be used to simultaneously alter the pathogenic target base and one or more bases of the splice</p>20 donor site (e.g., using a CABE or a cytidine deaminase base editor). One goal of treatment using a base editing strategy includes preventing the retention of a ~128bp cryptic exon (IVS26). An advantage of treating LCA10 using a base editing approach is that off-target and unintended edits are reduced relative to alternative strategies (e.g., a CRISPR approach). </p>The notation \u201cc.2991+1665A\u201d indicates exonic nucleotide 2991, where exonic</p>25 nucleotide 1 corresponds to the \u201cA\u201d of \u201cATG\u201d corresponding to the first translated codon of mRNA transcribed from the CEP290 gene (i.e., coding (c.) nucleotide 2991), and +1665A indicates an intronic adenine (A) nucleotide at position 1665 of the intron immediately downstream of exonic nucleotide 2991, where intronic nucleotide number 1 is the first nucleotide 3\u2019 of exonic nucleotide 2991. </p>30 290-KD centrosomal protein (CEP290) encodes a widely expressed centrosomal and ciliary protein of 290 kDa that plays an important role in ciliary trafficking and cilium assembly. In the photoreceptors, CEP290 localizes to the connecting cilium, the transitional zone linking the inner and outer segments of rods and cones. Over 100 CEP290 mutations have been identified that lead to a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from isolated early-onset </p>52 \n\n retinal dystrophy and Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis- 10 to more severe syndromes such as Senior Loken syndrome, Joubert syndrome, or Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MGS). </p>Hypomorphic CEP290 mutations are generally associated with non-syndromic forms of LCA, and account for an estimated 15% of all LCA cases in the Caucasian population. Not</p>5 intending to be bound by theory, cones are more vulnerable to mutations to CEP290 compared to rods, which may be a consequence of their higher metabolism. Therefore, the progression of vision loss in Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis- 10 typically begins with the loss of function primarily of cones and proceeds to the loss of function of rods. Not intending to be bound by theory, subsequent to cone degeneration, rod photoreceptor loss occurs in retinal</p>10 regions characterized by a low density of rods, while the high rod density retinal regions remain intact. Cones are involved in peripheral vision while rods are important for central vision. Therefore, in some embodiments, the methods of the present dis",
