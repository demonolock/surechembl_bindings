    "e was 2 mm and the thickness of the dieplate was 6 mm resulting in an L/D of the dieplate of 3. The resulting smooth extrudate was dried under vacuum overnight at 50\u00b0 C., resulting in a crackle dried extrudate. The dry matter content of the biomass dried in this way was about 94%.</p>A sample of about 180 g of the dried extrudate was extracted with hexane (initial volume/biomass ratio of 5 l/kg). After 3 hours of extraction at 60\u00b0 C. the micella was filtered over a Whatman filter. The resulting extracted biomass was washed once with 1000 ml of fresh hexane. The filtered micella recovered in this way was evaporated at 68\u00b0 C. (T<sub>waterbath</sub>). In this way a crude DHA containing oil was recovered. The DHA concentration in the oil was 32.6% analysed by means of GC. The in this way recovered oil contained about 67% of tri-glycerides, 12% di-glycerides, 3.7% of sterols and about 0.2% of antifoam (NMR). An other characteristic of the oil was the level of carotenoids (0.15 mg/ml of \u03b2-carotene and 5 mg/ml of \u03b3-carotene).</p>EXAMPLE 22 Recovery of Vitamin B12 from Propionibacterium sp. Broth from a large scale fermentation of a Propionibacterium sp. (28 tons) was harvested by means of a clarifier of the type BRPX-213-SGV(ALFA LAVAL, 3-7 tons/h) at a G-factor of about 5000. The broth clarified in this way was concentrated 2.5 times by means of ultra-filtration using a ABCOR KOCH module with about 150 m<sup>2 </sup>spiral-wound poly ethylene sulphone membranes with a cut-off of 5 kD (type HFK 131-VSV). The resulting ultra filtrate was diafiltrated for 500% according the concentrated volume with process water. The resulting diafiltrate was concentrated by a factor of 3 by means of vacuum evaporation, and the resulting concentrate heat shocked at 90\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes.</p>The resulting concentrate was granulated and dried in a NIRO 250 multi stage dryer (fluidised bed spray dryer/agglomerator). The inlet air temperature of the dryer had a temperature of about 250\u00b0 C. and the outlet air temperature was about 70\u00b0 C. The air flow applied was about 3000 m<sup>3</sup>/h. This resulted in a product temperature of about 70-80\u00b0 C. The density of the concentrate fed to the dryer was about 1050 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>A sample of about 2 g of dried granulate was used for extraction with 125 ml of about 75% of ethanol (the water content gives an optimal extraction/technical performance) in a conical flask by means of stirring during 60 minutes at ambient temperature (clear extract). After extraction the extracted biomass was filtered using a Whatman paper filter (easy filtration). The clear pink filtrate recovered in this way was analysed for vitamin B12. The resulting biomass was washed with 25 ml of about 75% ethanol. In this way about 90% of the vitamin B12 was extracted from the granulated biomass (Table 4).</p>TABLE 4Data concerning extraction of vitamin B12 from Multi stageagglomerated Propionic bacterium.density[vitamintotalsampleinB12]vitaminnumbergmlkg/m<sup>"
