For example, the tricyclic phenol may be treated with triflic anhydride (Tf<sub>2</sub>O) to provide the corresponding trifluoromethanesulfonate, which is subsequently converted to the pinacol boronate ester (not shown) using a palladium catalyst, such as, [1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium (II), (PdCl<sub>2</sub>(dppf)) and pinacol borane, in the presence of a base such as triethyl amine (TEA) and a suitable solvent such as dioxane. Typically, the reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures. Treatment of the resulting tricyclic boronate ester with chloramine-T (N-chloro tosylamide sodium salt) and sodium iodide (NaI) in a mixture of water and THF afforded the corresponding iodotricyclic compound.</p>Preparation C<img id=\"EMI-C00032\" path=\"US20120295882A1-20121122-C00032.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/212438178/US/20121122/A1/020120/29/58/82/US20120295882A1-20121122-C00032.TIF\"/></p>Additional intermediates useful in the preparation of compounds of Formula I may be accessed by the route shown above. Various halo-benzofuran-2-ones may be prepared from an appropriately substituted halophenol, where Hal represents a halogen such as bromine or iodine, which when treated with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and potassium iodide (KI) in a suitable solvent, such as acetone provides the corresponding halobenzoate. In practice, the reaction may be conducted at elevated temperatures, such as about 50\u00b0 C. Cyclization of the halobenzoate using LHMDS (lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) in THF at low temperature, and treating the resulting halobenzofuran (not shown) with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a mixture of ethanol and water provides the corresponding halo-benzofuran-2-one. In practice, this reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures, such as about 80\u00b0 C.</p>Treatment of the halo-benzofuran-2-one with an appropriate base such as sodium hydride and an appropriately substituted cyanophosphonate, such as for example diethylcyanomethylphosphonate, in a suitable solvent such as THF affords the corresponding halobenzofuran nitrile. After treatment with a strong base such as LHMDS in an appropriate solvent such as THF, the halobenzonitrile can be alkylated using the appropriate alkyl bromide or alkyl iodide. Conversion to the amine may then be affected using an appropriate reducing agent, such as for example diborane, in a suitable solvent, such as THF, at low temperature. Completion of the halotricyclic scaffold may be affected via a Pictet-Spengler cyclization reaction with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone, in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl) or TFA, optionally in the presence of an organic co-solvent such as toluene or DCM.

Novelty-seeking behavior in humans has long been associated with alcoholism and sustance abuse. Psychiatry Res, 1979, 1, 255-264. Traditionally, novelty-seeking behavior has been linked to dopamine-mediated neurotransmission. However, there is evidence that behavioral responses to novelty may also be mediated by 5-HT. A reliable animal model of human novelty-seeking behavior that is highly predictive of drug use has been developed. This model and has recently been used to gain insight into the potential contribution of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>and 5-HT, receptors to novelty-seeking behavior and associated behaviors such as substance abuse. See Neuropsychobiology 1996, 34, 136-145; Exp. Clin. Psychopharmacol 2005, 13, 367-375.</p>The compounds described herein were tested for their ability to bind to the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor. The ability of the compounds of the formula I to bind to the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor may be measured using the assay and general procedures described below or by methods known in the art. The compounds of Formula I were generally found to be 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>ligands, more specifically, the compounds of Formula I were generally found to be 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor antagonists.</p>In some embodiments, compounds of Formula I have an inhibition constant K<sub>i </sub>of the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor of less than (&lt;) 500 nM.</p>In other embodiments, compounds of Formula I have an inhibition constant K<sub>i </sub>to the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor greater than (&gt;) 500 nM but less than (&lt;) 1000 nM.</p>In still other embodiments, compounds of Formula I have an inhibition constant K<sub>i </sub>to the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor greater than (&gt;) 1000 nM.</p>Human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>Receptor Binding AssayMembrane PreparationMembranes were prepared from CHO\u2014K1 cells stably transfected with the human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor (Euroscreen; ES-316-C). The cells were grown in Gibco Advanced DMEM-F12 (Cat#12634010) containing 2% dialyzed FBS (Hyclone Cat# SH30079.03). The cells were harvested in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mM EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation (1000\u00d7g), the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. prior to membrane preparation. Membranes were prepared as previously described (J Bio Chem. 1992, 267 (14) 9844-51). Briefly, frozen cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA and 1 complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.) per 50 mL buffer, and homogenized with a tissue homogenizer. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 40,000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. to collect the membranes. The membrane pellets were washed in membrane buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet per 50 mL buffer) using a tissue homogenizer. The membranes were centrifuged at 40,000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. and the pellets were resuspended in membrane buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, and protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierc",

Test compounds or assay controls for total and non-specific binding were diluted in DMSO as 100\u00d7 solutions and serially diluted by half log concentrations on a Perkin Elmer JANUS Automated Workstation. Serotonin (10 \u03bcM final concentration) was used to determine non-specific binding in the assay. Plates were read using the Microbeta Trilux 1450 LSC and luminescence counter.
