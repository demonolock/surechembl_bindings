FIG. 9A. High levels of miR-34a-5p produced from nCAR/miR-34a-5p led to a consistent reduction of protein levels of miR-34a targets (e.g., CDK6 and SIRT1) in 293T cells, whereas the effects might disappear (CDK6) or retain (SIRT1) in Dicer-KO cells due a much lower level of miR-34a-5p. FIG. 9B. The production of miR-124-3p at distinct lengths and positions in wild-type and Dicer-KO cells could cause different effects on the protein expression of some known miR-124 targets (e.g., STAT3 and MRP4).

A, Computational analysis identified four putative MRE sites for miR-1291 within the 3\u2032UTR of ARID3B mRNA. Underlined is the seed sequence of miR-1291. B, Dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that ARID3B 3\u2032UTR luciferase activities were increased about 50% in AsPC-1 cells treated with MSA/mir-1291, as compared to controls. C, qPCR analyses revealed that MSA/mir-1291 was selectively processed to mature miR-1291 in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells, and subsequently upregulated ARID3B mRNA levels (D). E, Immunoblot analyses showed that ARID3B protein levels were elevated in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells after transfection with bioengineered miR-1291. Both the full-length ARID3B (ARID3B-F, \u02dc61 kD) and the short-form ARID3B (ARID3B-sh, \u02dc28 kD) were upregulated in PANC-1 (72 h post-transfection) and AsPC-1 (48 and 72 h) cells, as compared to vehicle and MSA controls. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.

Tumor-bearing mice were treated intravenously with a single dose of in vivo-jetPEI-formulated miR-1291 prodrug (25 \u03bcg/mouse). 24-h later, tumor and liver tissues were harvested and total RNAs were isolated. Levels of miR-1291 were determined with TaqMan stem-loop RT-qPCR assay, which were much higher in livers and tumors isolated from MSA/mir-1291-treated PANC-1 xenograft (A) and PDX (B) mice, as compared with MSA control (N=2 mice per group in PANC-1 xenograft model, and N=3 mice per group in PDX model).</p>FIG. 36 illustrates representative H&amp;E images of PDX-PA-0387 tumors.

    "eporter activities were decreased in cells treated with miR-1291 antagomir (FIG. 28B). These experiments using different tools to interfere with miR-1291 expression/functions are consistent, and the results suggest that miR-1291 targets ARID3B 3\u2032UTR and may positively regulate the expression of ARID3B.</p>MiR-1291 upregulates the mRNA and protein levels of ARID3B in PC cells. To define the effects of miR-1291 on the expression of ARID3B, we first verified the production of high levels of mature miR-1291 from bioengineered MSA/mir-1291 prodrug in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells with TaqMan stem-loop RT-qPCR assay kit (FIG. 27C). We then compared ARID3B mRNA levels in PC cells treated with MSA/mir-1291 and control MSA. Compared to vehicle control treatments, MSA did not alter ARID3B mRNA levels. Treatment with MSA/mir-1291 (20 nM) led to a 1.2- and 1.4-fold increase in ARID3B mRNA levels in PANC-1 cells, as compared to MSA or vehicle control, at 48 h and 72 h post-treatment, respectively (FIG. 27D). Similarly, MSA/mir-1291 (5 nM) caused a 4.7-fold and 3.2-fold upregulation of ARID3B mRNA levels in AsPC-1 cells (FIG. 27D), at 48 h and 72 h post-treatment, respectively.</p>We further conducted Western blots to examine the impact of miR-1291 on ARID3B protein levels in PC cells. As found in other types of human carcinoma cell lines by other investigators (31), we observed two different ARID3B bands in both PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells which are designated as full-length ARID3B (ARID3B-Fl, \u02dc61 kD) and short-form ARID3B (ARID3B-sh, \u02dc28 kD), respectively (FIG. 27E). Our data showed that ARID3B-FL protein levels increased around 50% in PANC-1 cells at 72 h post-transfection with 20 nM miR-1291 prodrug. A higher degree of increase of ARID3B-FL protein levels was found in AsPC-1 cells at both 48 h (80%) and 72 h (200%) post-treatment with 5 nM miR-1291. Interestingly, impact of miR-1291 on ARID3B-Sh protein levels appeared to follow the same pattern as ARID3B-Fl in both PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells (FIG. 27E). These results indicate that miR-1291 upregulates ARID3B expression in PC cells.</p>Individual and combined actions of miR-1291 prodrug and Gem-nP on DNA damage, mitosis arrest, and apoptosis. Historically, single drug exerted very limited efficacy for the treatment of PC. Therefore, we aimed at examining combination effects (FIG. 29A) while assessing miR-1291 monotherapy and comparing it to Gem-nP, the first-line chemotherapy for PC. Individual and combined actions of miR-1291 prodrug (10 nM in PANC-1 cells, 3 nM in AsPC-1 cells) and Gem-nP on their corresponding target or marker proteins were first investigated in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells by Western blots (FIG. 29B-C). Our data showed that co-administration of Gem-nP did not alter miR-1291-controlled upregulation of ARID3B in PANC-1 cells but enhanced the effects in AsPC-1 cells, again suggesting distinct sensitivities of the two cell lines. Immunoblot (FIG. 29B-C) and immunofluorescence studies were further conducted to determine single and combined drug effe",
    "e (\u03b3-H2A.X foci), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3/7) and mitotic arrest (H3PS10) (FIG. 29D-F; FIG. 30, FIG. 31). The results showed that, in addition to the induction of apoptosis (caspase-3/7) in both PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cell lines, miR-1291 alone surprisingly elicited obvious DNA damage (formation of \u03b3-H2A.X foci) in AsPC-1 cells. On the other hand, Gem-nP largely provoked DNA damage and mitotic arrest in both PC cell lines, as manifested by an upregulation of \u03b3-H2A.X and H3PS10, respectively. Most importantly, combination treatment with miR-1291 prodrug and Gem-nP caused the greatest extents of DNA damage, mitosis and apoptosis in both PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells, which were indicated by \u03b3H2A.X, H3PS10, and cleaved caspase-3/7 (C-caspase-3/7), respectively. These results demonstrate that miR-1291 induces apoptosis and possibly DNA damage, and suggest that combination therapy with miR-1291 and Gem-nP may produce optimal outcomes.</p>Bioengineered miR-1291 prodrug enhances the sensitivity of PC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. To assess whether miR-1291 prodrug could increase the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to Gem-nP, the anti-proliferative activity of Gem-nP in the presence of mir-1291 prodrug or control MSA was evaluated in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells by Celltiter-Glo assay. The results showed that miR-1291 treated PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells were much more sensitive to Gem-nP, as compared to MSA treated cells (FIG. 32). The enhanced sensitivity was also manifested by the lower EC50 value in miR-1291 treated PANC-1 cells (155\u00b133 nM) than that in MSA treated cells (52.3\u00b120.3 nM, *P&lt;0.05). In addition, miR-1291 transfected AsPC-1 cells also showed a significantly lower EC50 value (40.4\u00b11.8 nM) than MSA treated cells (14.6\u00b15.5 nM, **P&lt;0.01) (FIG. 32E). These results show that co-administratiof of miR- is able to sensitize PC cells to chemotherapies.</p>Bioengineered miR-1291 prodrug monotherapy and combination therapy with Gem-nP are effective to control tumor growth in PANC-1 xenograft mouse models, while they are well tolerated in mice. To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of bioengineered miR-1291 prodrug monotherapy and combination therapy with Gem-nP in vivo, we first established PANC-1 xenograft mouse models (FIG. 33A). Systematic administration of a single dose of in vivo-jetPEI formulated miR-1291 prodrug was distributable to PANC-1 xenograft tumor tissues, as indicated by high levels of tumoral miR-1291 at 24 h after drug administration (FIG. 33A). Compared to buffer or MSA treatment, miR-1291 prodrug alone significantly suppressed PANC-1 tumor growth to a similar degree as Gem-nP, while combination treatment with miR-1291 and Gem-nP inhibited tumor growth to the greatest extent (FIG. 33B). Visual inspection and weights of the dissected tumors (FIG. 33C-D) further demonstrated the remarkably optimal tumor suppressive effects for combination therapy. Interestingly, sizes of final tumors among miR-1291 prodrug treatment group were relatively variable where 50% were highly responsive and 50% were less responsive (FIG. 33C). By contrast, all tumors were ubiquitously reduced to similar sizes by combination treatment. These results dem",
    " models. Compared xenograft models derived from cancer cell lines, PDX tumor models may better preserve the heterogeneity and histological characteristics of the original tumors and thus provide greater representative accuracy and fidelity to human diseases (32-34). Therefore, we established three PDX models from clinical PC samples and employed them to further assess miR-1291 prodrug therapies. The first PDX model (PA-0387, FIG. 34) was subjected to the same dose regimens as those used in PANC-1 xenograft mouse models. Similarly, RT-qPCR analyses confirmed high levels of miR-1291 in PDX tissues at 24 h after systemic administration of a single dose of miR-1291 prodrug (FIG. 35B). Therapy data showed that treatment with miR-1291 prodrug or Gem-nP alone significantly reduced PDX PA-0387 tumor growth, as compared to buffer or MSA control; and combination treatment showed the highest degree of inhibition (FIG. 34A). Likewise, visual inspection of dissected tumors (FIG. 34B) and examination of final tumor weights (FIG. 34C) supported the effectiveness of miR-1291 prodrug alone, Gem-nP alone, and their combination in the control of PDX PA-0387, while there was no statistical difference between mono- and combination therapy. H&amp;E staining further demonstrated that PDXs indeed showed the histologic phenotypic characteristics close to clinical pancreatic adenocarcinomas (FIG. 36). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies showed that there was no difference in cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining) between different treatment groups, while tumors from combination treatment group showed the highest levels of apoptosis (cleaved-caspase-3) (FIG. 34D), supporting the induction of apoptosis as a major mechanism behind their anti-tumor activities. In addition, none of animals showed any signs of stress, and there was no significant difference in body weights (FIG. 34D) and blood biochemistry profiles (FIG. 34F) among different treatments, suggesting that all drug treatments were safe to PDX-bearing mice.</p>Another PDX model, PA-0375, was utilized to critically assess the efficacy of miR-1291 prodrug monotherapy and combination therapy with Gem-nP, by following the same dosing regimens for PNAC-1 (FIG. 33A) and PA-0387 PDX. Our data showed that treatment with wither bioengineered miR-1291 prodrug or Gem-nP, alone or in combination, was able to significantly suppress PA-0375 PDX tumor growth in mice (FIG. 37A-C). While it was not statistically significant different between mono- and combination therapy, combination therapy obviously produced the greatest extent of inhibition.</p>Because the third PDX model, PA-0327, was more aggressive than the other two PDX models, we refined the dosing regimens by increasing miR-1291 prodrug dose to 20 \u03bcg/mouse for both mono- and combination therapy, while using the same dose of Gem-nP. Optimal outcomes were surprisingly observed (FIG. 37D-F). Compared to buffer and MSA treatment, monotherapy with miR-1291 prodrug significant"
