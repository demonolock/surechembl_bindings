    "steps:</p>(1) Day 0: cell plating</p>Cells were diluted to the desired concentration according to the seeding density using an automatic counter count. TMD 8 cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells per well, and Ba/F3-KIF5B-RET, ba/F3-KIF5B-RET-V804M, ba/F3-KIF5B-RET-G810R cells were 2000 cells per well. The cell suspension was added to a 96-well plate at 100. Mu.l per well with medium as background control (Min). Placing at 37 deg.C, 5% CO  <sub>2</sub> The incubator was left overnight.</p>(2) Day 1: administration treatment</p>Each compound was set at 10 dosing groups with an initial concentration of 10 micromoles per liter, 3-fold dilution.</p>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolved compounds were prepared as 200-fold stock solutions. At the time of use, the stock solution was diluted 3-fold with medium to a final concentration, i.e., 3. Mu.l of 200-fold stock solution was added to 197. Mu.l of medium. 50 microliters of the diluted mixture was added to 96-well plate medium at 37\u2103with 5% CO <sub>2</sub> Incubate in incubator for 72 hours.</p>(3) Day 4: data detection</p>The 96-well plate was allowed to stand at room temperature prior to detection, and 40. Mu.l CellTiter-Glo was added to each well <sup>@</sup> A reagent; cells were lysed by mixing for 2 minutes on a plate shaker. Incubation at room temperature for 60 minAnd detecting the fluorescence signal value after the fluorescence signal is stable.</p>(4) Data analysis</p>The S-type dose-response curve was plotted and IC50 values calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software.</p>The Inhibition Rate (IR) of the test compound was calculated using the following formula:</p>IR (%) = (1- (RLU compound-RLU placebo)/(RLU vehicle control-RLU placebo) \u00d7100%.</p>Inhibition rates of compounds at different concentrations were calculated in Excel, and then plotted using GraphPad Prism software and relevant parameters including minimum inhibition rate, maximum inhibition rate and IC50 were calculated. </p>RLU: relative to the light unit, i.e. the fluorescence value.</p>2.2DoHH-2 inhibition of cell proliferation</p>The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p>(1) Day 1: cell plating and test sample dosing</p>a) 96-well plates with a DoHH-2 cell seeding density of 1.5x10 <sup>4</sup> Each cell per well. 100 microliters of medium was added per well;</p>b) First, the mother liquor of the compound was diluted from 10 millimoles to 1000, 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1 micromole per liter, and the mother liquor of the Panobinostat was diluted from 100 micromole to 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 micromole per liter, and the DMSO content was 100%; c) After thoroughly mixing, 4.6 microliters of the electric row gun was removed and added to 225.4 microliters of medium, at which time 50-fold dilution was achieved with 2% DMSO;</p>d) 100 microliters (c) of each of the two compound wells (a) was added to give final concentrations of 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 micromoles per liter, and the final concentrations of panobinostat were 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 nanomoles per liter, for a total of 200 microliters of medium with a DMSO content of 1%;</p>e) The cells were incubated at 37\u2103with 5% CO <sub>2</sub> The incubation in the incubator was performed after 3 days.</p>(2) Day 4: detection of</p>a) After leaving 50.
