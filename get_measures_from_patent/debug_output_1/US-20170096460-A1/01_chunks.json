    "9; and METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Vol. 119, \u201cChromatin Protocols\u201d (P. B. Becker, ed.) Humana Press, Totowa, 1999.</p>DEFINITIONSThe terms \u201cnucleic acid,\u201d \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d and \u201coligonucleotide\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer, in linear or circular conformation, and in either single- or double-stranded form. For the purposes of the present disclosure, these terms are not to be construed as limiting with respect to the length of a polymer. The terms can encompass known analogues of natural nucleotides, as well as nucleotides that are modified in the base, sugar and/or phosphate moieties (e.g., phosphorothioate backbones). In general, an analogue of a particular nucleotide has the same base-pairing specificity; i.e., an analogue of A will base-pair with T.</p>The terms \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d \u201cpeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The term also applies to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogues or modified derivatives of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid.</p>\u201cBinding\u201d refers to a sequence-specific, non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g., between a protein and a nucleic acid). Not all components of a binding interaction need be sequence-specific (e.g., contacts with phosphate residues in a DNA backbone), as long as the interaction as a whole is sequence-specific. Such interactions are generally characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>or lower. \u201cAffinity\u201d refers to the strength of binding: increased binding affinity being correlated with a lower K<sub>d</sub>.</p>A \u201cbinding protein\u201d is a protein that is able to bind non-covalently to another molecule. A binding protein can bind to, for example, a DNA molecule (a DNA-binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a protein molecule (a protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein-binding protein, it can bind to itself (to form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more molecules of a different protein or proteins. A binding protein can have more than one type of binding activity. For example, zinc finger proteins have DNA-binding, RNA-binding and protein-binding activity.</p>A \u201czinc finger DNA binding protein\u201d (or binding domain) is a protein, or a domain within a larger protein, that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner through one or more zinc fingers, which are regions of amino acid sequence within the binding domain whose structure is stabilized through coordination of a zinc ion. The term zinc finger DNA binding protein is often abbreviated as zinc finger protein or ZFP.</p>A \u201cTALE DNA binding domain\u201d or \u201cTALE\u201d is a polypeptide comprising one or more TALE repeat domains/units. The repeat domains are involved in binding of the TALE to its cognate target DNA sequence. A single \u201crepeat unit\u201d (also referred to as a \u201crepeat\u201d) is typically"
