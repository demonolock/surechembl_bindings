    "ide (NHS), aldehyde, nitrophenylcarbonate (NPC), and tresylate (TRES)). Suitable activated polymer molecules are commercially available, e.g. from Nektar Therapeutics, Huntsville, Ala., USA, or from PolyMASC Pharmaceuticals plc, UK. </p> Specific examples of activated linear or branched polymer molecules for use in the present invention are described in the Nektar Molecule Engineering Catalog 2003 (Nektar Therapeutics), incorporated herein by reference. </p> Specific examples of activated PEG polymers include the following linear PEGs: NHS-PEG (e.g. SPA-PEG, SSPA-PEG, SBA-PEG, SS-PEG, SSA-PEG, SC-PEG, SG-PEG, and SCM-PEG), and NOR-PEG, BTC-PEG, EPOX-PEG, NCO-PEG, NPC-PEG, CDI-PEG, ALD-PEG, TRES-PEG, VS-PEG, IODO-PEG, and MAL-PEG, and branched PEGs such as PEG2-NHS and those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,462 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additional publications disclosing useful polymer molecules, PEGylation chemistries and conjugation methods are listed in WO 01/58935 and WO 03/093465. </p> Specific examples of activated PEG polymers particularly preferred for coupling to cysteine residues, include the following linear PEGs: vinylsulfone-PEG (VS-PEG), preferably vinylsulfone-mPEG (VS-mPEG); maleimide-PEG (MAL-PEG), preferably maleimide-mPEG (MAL-mPEG) and orthopyridyl-disulfide-PEG (OPSS-PEG), preferably orthopyridyl-disulfide-mPEG (OPSS-mPEG). Typically, such PEG or mPEG polymers will have a size of about 5 kDa, about 10 kD, about 12 kDa or about 20 kDa. </p> The skilled person will be aware that the activation method and/or conjugation chemistry to be used depends on the attachment group(s) of the variant polypeptide (examples of which are given further above), as well as the functional groups of the polymer (e.g. being amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, aldehyde, sulfydryl, succinimidyl, maleimide, vinysulfone or haloacetate). The PEGylation may be directed towards conjugation to all available attachment groups on the variant polypeptide (i.e. such attachment groups that are exposed at the surface of the polypeptide) or may be directed towards one or more specific attachment groups, e.g. the N-terminal amino group as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,265 or to cysteine residues. Furthermore, the conjugation may be achieved in one step or in a stepwise manner (e.g. as described in WO 99/55377). </p> For PEGylation to cysteine residues (see above) the FVII or FVIIa variant is usually treated with a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DDT) prior to PEGylation. The reducing agent is subsequently removed by any conventional method, such as by desalting. Conjugation of PEG to a cysteine residue typically takes place in a suitable buffer at pH 6-9 at temperatures varying from 4\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. for periods up to 16 hours. </p> It will be understood that the PEGylation is designed so as to produce the optimal molecule with respect to the number of PEG molecules attached, the size and form of such molecules"
