{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe modelling indicated that the lung was the primary metabolic organ for CNS 7056 with the liver possibly contributing as little as 10% of the drug's clearance.\nA 50 mcg dose of fentanyl typically contributed about 5-10% of the sedative effect of a 20 mg total dose of CNS 7056, integrated over the whole procedure.\nBoth models were refined by the introduction of a \u201cscoping factor\u201d, which increased EC50, and described the reduction in sedation resulting from the presence of a colonoscope and a \u201cpain factor\u201d, which also increased EC50, and corresponded to sudden \u201cspikes\u201d of increased MOAA/S score."}
