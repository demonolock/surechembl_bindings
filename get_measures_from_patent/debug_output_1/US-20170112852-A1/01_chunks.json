    "lonoscope. Further 0.04 mg/kg doses of CNS 7056 were administered during the procedure, no earlier than two minutes after the previous dose, in order to maintain a MOAA/S level of 4 for 30 minutes; no more than seven doses (the initial and six top-up doses) could be administered to any subject. The gender ratio in each cohort was 7:8. Venous plasma levels of CNS 7056 were measured at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose.</p>AnalysisPhysiologically-based three- and four-compartment pharmacokinetic models were fitted to the arterial and venous plasma levels of CNS 7056 from the combined data obtained in Studies CNS 7056-001 and CNS 7056-002 using the non-linear modelling programme, NONMEM. The possible influence of body weight, sex and heart rate on volumes and clearances was examined by covariate analysis. The derived pharmacokinetic parameters from the preferred models were then used to simulate the arterial concentrations of the drug at the time points at which pharmacodynamic data, MOAA/S scores and blood pressures, were obtained and sigmoid inhibitory pharmacodynamic models fitted to the observations via a \u201clink\u201d model, again using NONMEM. A number of sudden, apparently random, increases in MOAA/S score of short duration were identified within the data-set and attributed to external stimuli such as acute pain from the colonoscope or treatment by the nursing staff; these were modelled by the introduction of a covariate which increased EC50. Another covariate, the \u201cscoping-factor\u201d which also increased EC50, was added to the model in order to simulate reduced sedation during the actual colonoscopy procedure caused by general irritation. As no concentrations of fentanyl were obtained during Study CNS 7056-002, historical values of clearances and volumes of distribution were used in order to simulate plasma levels of the opioid so that pharmacodynamic models of hypotension and interaction with CNS 7056 could be developed. The interaction model of sedation introduced a covariate, estimated by the modelling, which converted simulated plasma levels of fentanyl into concentrations of CNS 7056 at the effect site.</p>Population Pharmacokinetic AnalysisA sequential population approach was employed, first estimating the pharmacokinetic parameters for CNS 7056 and then using these results to obtain the corresponding pharmacodynamic parameters. A non-linear, mixed-effect modelling programme (NONMEM, version 6) was applied to the data using the first order conditional estimation with interaction method (FOCE-I). Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models were fitted to a combination of arterial and venous plasma levels of CNS 7056 from the combined CNS 7056-001 and CNS 7056-002 data sets (FIG. 2), using the ADVAN6 sub-programme, with tolerance (TOL) set to five, to solve the differential equations. All the models contained a central compartment corresponding to the venous system and other highly perfused tissues, arterial, pulmonary, peripheral and deep compartments. Clearance of CNS ",
    "r compartments of unknown volume plus pulmonary and arterial compartments, whose volumes were assumed to be proportional to body weight, were fitted to these data.</p>The modelling indicated that the lung was the primary metabolic organ for CNS 7056 with the liver possibly contributing as little as 10% of the drug's clearance. The pulmonary extraction ratio, and first-pass metabolism, was estimated to be approximately 28%.</p>Body weight was not a statistically significant predictor of the systemic clearance of CNS 7056 and so dosing in units of mg/kg offers no advantage in terms of consistency of exposure to CNS 7056.</p>Continuous pharmacodynamic models of MOAA/S scores were fitted to the observed data. The first, simpler model was fitted directly to the raw data and any effects of differences in fentanyl dosing regimens were incorporated into the pharmacodynamic parameters. The second model simulated fentanyl concentrations, using the same historical pharmacokinetic parameters for all subjects, and was able to estimate the pharmacodynamic interaction between CNS 7056 and fentanyl. A 50 mcg dose of fentanyl typically contributed about 5-10% of the sedative effect of a 20 mg total dose of CNS 7056, integrated over the whole procedure. The acute effect was larger, a 50 mcg dose being responsible for an additional maximal fall in MOAA/S score of roughly one unit when combined with CNS 7056.</p>Both models were refined by the introduction of a \u201cscoping factor\u201d, which increased EC50, and described the reduction in sedation resulting from the presence of a colonoscope and a \u201cpain factor\u201d, which also increased EC50, and corresponded to sudden \u201cspikes\u201d of increased MOAA/S score.</p>Despite large improvements in the quality of the models with these modifications, shown by reductions in objective function of several hundred, the observed zero MOAA/S scores were still poorly fitted. This defect was resolved by modifying the zero scores in the data-set to negative values (\u22121.25 or \u22121.3). The exact correspondence of the observed and fitted scores was 70% for the final fentanyl-interaction model with 23% of the results differing by one.</p>The CNS 7056-fentanyl interaction model fitted the observed data significantly better than the simpler model (\u0394OFV\u02dc\u221230). However, its major advantage resulted from its ability to include inter-subject variability in both of the highly variable scoping and concentration-equivalence factors (\u0394OFV\u02dc\u2212200).</p>Monte Carlo simulations of a wide range of dosing regimens suggested that a loading dose of 8 mg of CNS 7056 plus 100 mcg of fentanyl, followed by 3 mg top-up doses at intervals of no less than 2 minutes, would be optimal in terms of minimising drop-outs, MOAA/S scores of zero and failures (subjects whose sedation was not maintained satisfactorily for 24 minutes with 6 top-ups) and maximising the number suitable for insertion of the colonoscope after the loading dose of CNS 7056.</p>Provided it was not large, the time interval between fentanyl and CNS 7056 dosage made little difference to the simulations, which indicated that the loading dose of CNS 705"
