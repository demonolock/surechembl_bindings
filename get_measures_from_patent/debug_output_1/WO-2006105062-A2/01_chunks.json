    "ude kappa (K) and lambda (\u03bb) light chain genetic loci and heavy chain genetic loci, which include constant region genes mu (\u03bc), delta (\u03b4), gamma (\u03b3), sigma (\u03c3), and alpha (\u03b1) for the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes, respectively. An \"antibody\" as used herein, unless otherwise specified, includes full-length antibodies and fragments thereof, including naturally occurring antibodies, chimeric antibodies, recombinant antibodies including humanized antibodies, or antibodies subjected to other in vitro alterations, and antigen binding fragments thereof. Chimeric antibodies are molecules in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a particular species or belongs to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is derived from another species or belongs to another antibody class or subclass. With regard to antibody fragments, those fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, such as, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), and the like, as \n\nwell as Fes, which can be prepared by in vitro treatments of full-length antibodies or by recombinant means. Methods of preparation and purification of antibodies are known in the art (see Harlow and Lane, 1988). A polypeptide, or a protein such as an antibody or fragment thereof incorporating an altered Fc region of the invention is one which specifically binds at least one FcR.</p>\"Specifically binds\" includes a binding constant in the range of at least 10<sup>'3</sup> to 10<sup>\"</sup> <sup>6</sup> M<sup>'1</sup>, and optionally in a range of 10<sup>~7</sup> to lO<sup>\"10</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, as measured by methods well known to the art.</p>Humanized antibodies are chimeric molecules of Igs, Ig chains or fragments thereof from two or more sources, one of which is a human source, which are further altered in primary sequence to reduce non-human Ig sequences and/or to increase sequences corresponding to those found in human antibodies, e.g., human Ig consensus sequences. Humanized antibodies include residues that form a complementary determining region (CDR) in the Fv region that are from a CDR of a non-human species such as mouse, rat or rabbit having desired properties, e.g., specificity and/or affinity for a particular antigen. In general, a humanized antibody includes substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the sequences in the CDR regions correspond to those of non-human Ig sequences and all or substantially all of the framework regions correspond to human Ig sequences, such as human Ig consensus sequences. Replacement of non-human residues to a corresponding human residue, human residues to a corresponding consensus residue, non- human residues to a corresponding consensus residue, or human residues to a corresponding non-human residue, are based on comparisons of human Ig sequences or comparisons of human Ig ",
    "/sup> as 100% lysis. \n\nFollowing a 4 hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C, the supernatants were collected and counted on a gamma Counter (Cobra II auto-gamma from Packard Instruments) with a reading window of 240-400 keV. The counts per minute were plotted as a function of antibody concentration and the data was analyzed by non-linear regression, sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) using Prism software (San Diego, CA). The percent lysis was determined by the following equation: % Lysis = (Sample CPM- no antibody CPM)/100% lysis CPM-No antibody CPM) X lOO. Results Figure 1 presents the sequence of the anti-CD30 antibody (5Fl 1) that was mutated to produce the variants of the invention. The heavy chain of this antibody is of the gammal f allotype. The light chain is a kappa light chain. The variable region sequences of the antibody are published in WO 03/059282. The mutagenesis of the antibody involved the constant region rather than the antigen- binding region.</p>The following relates to the results presented in Figure 2. hi column A, antibody (Ab) variants of the invention are designated by their amino acid residue number (EU Kabat). The first letter refers to the wild type amino acid and the last letter refers to the variant amino acid. For example, V240Q indicates that the variant contains a glutamine (Q) at amino acid position 240 instead of a valine (V).</p>As depicted in columns B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L, the Ab variants were assayed and compared to the wild type using a binding assay. This binding assay measures the binding of the Ab variant to each of the individual Fc receptors listed at the top of the respective column. The average values (\u00b1 standard deviation, SD) listed in the table are derived from a collection of binding results (n replicates) expressed as the ratio of the signal produced by the Ab variant divided by the wild-type anti-CD30 Ab signal. For example, a ratio of 1 indicates that the Ab variant bound to a particular Fc receptor (listed at the top of the column) and gave a signal equal to the wild type Ab. A ratio of 2 indicates that the Ab variants bound to a particular Fc receptor (listed at the top of the column) and gave a signal 2-fold greater than the wild type Ab. \n\n Columns C, E, and M provide relative residual binding measurements as measured using a binding assay. The relative residual binding assay measures the variant still bound to each of the individual Fc receptors (listed at the top of the column) 1 hour after all the assay reagents are diluted 10-fold. The average values (+ SD) listed in the table are derived from a collection of binding results (n replicates) expressed as the ratio of the signal produced by the Ab variant divided by the wild-type anti-CD30 Ab signal. For example, a ratio of 1 indicates that the Ab variant bound to a particular Fc receptor (listed at the top of the column) and gave a signal equal to the wild type Ab. A ratio of 2 indicates that the Ab variants bound to a particular Fc receptor (listed at the top of the column) and gave a signal 2-fold higher than the wild type Ab.</p>Column N provides a mathematical ratio generated by dividing the huCD16-Phe ratio value in Column D by the human CD32b ratio value in Column F. A large ratio indicates higher antibody binding to huCD16-Phe relative to huCD32b, a presumed binding characteristic of antibodies having enhanced ADCC function.</p>Each Ab variant contains a set of 3 rows indicating the following values:</p>The first row represents the average binding ratio values corresponding to each</p>Fc receptor. Ab variants listed in this table generally have an average huCD16- VaI binding ratio &gt; 1.3 (Col B) or a huCD 16-Phe binding ratio &gt; 1.5 (Col D). The second row represents the standard deviations (SD) of the binding ratio values corresponding to each Fc receptor. The third row represents the total number of Ab variant samples (n replicates) that have been individually screened on the binding assay that corresponds to each Fc receptor. It is of interest that variants A330F and P247V exhibited increased human CD 16 binding since these variants have been reported by others (e.g., U.S. published application No. 2004/0123101) to have reduced binding to the same receptor.</p>Single substitution antibody variants were also tested in ADCC assays and the activities were compared to wild type antibody. The variants were tested at 2 concentrations, 0.5 \u03bcg/mL and 0.01 \u03bcg/mL, and percent lysis was calculated. The Delfia \u00ae ADCC assay was run initially followed by the <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay. \n\nIn general, the results from the two assays were similar. Antibodies with substitutions that induced % lysis greater than the wild type antibody are shown in Figure 3. Eight to ten of the single substitutions were selected for incorporation into reassemply libraries.</p>Example 2</p>Analysis of Fc Region Variants with Multiple Substitutions A subset of substitutions from antibodies with improved CD 16 binding (Example 1) were used to prepare a library of antibodies with two or more substitutions. One library was prepared with substitutions at 8 different positions (the 8 residue library), and another library was prepared with substitutions at 10 different positions (the 10 residue library). The libraries were screened in in vitro binding assays and ADCC assays in a manner similar to that described in Example 1 (see Figures 4-7). For cell lysis, L540 cells and a Delfia ADCC ",
    "gure 6B, positions with substitutions resulting in the greatest enhancement of percent lysis were: 292, 297, 304, 310, 314, 315, 316, 320, 321, and 322, and those with highest mean percent lysis at 0.5 \u03bcg/mL: were: 314, 315, 316, 320, 321, 322, 364, 366, 367, and 392. Six of those ten positions were identified in the 10 residue library and 4 were from the 8 residue library. Common positions for the greatest enhancement of lysis and mean percent lysis were: 292, 314, 315, 316, 320, 321, and 322. The top ten antibodies with altered Fc regions based on both criteria are present in antibodies BD20321, BD20292, BD20316, BD20320, BD20322, BD20315, BD20314, BD20304, BD20364, and BD20366.</p>To determine whether there was a correlation between ADCC results and huCD16-Val or -Phe binding results, certain antibodies with 1, 2 or 3 substitutions in the Fc region were selected for study (Figure 7). Interestingly, antibodies with one or more substitutions in the Fc region with the highest CD 16 \n\nbinding were not as likely to be those with the most enhanced ADCC (Figure 7A). In contrast, antibodies with one or more substitutions in the Fc region with poor CD 16 binding did not have significantly enhanced ADCC. One explanation for these observations may be that even if the Fc binds the receptor, side chain interactions may be involved in enhancing ADCC. The results for huCD16-Phe binding showed a better correlation with ADCC than huCD16-Val binding (Figures 7B-C).</p>The percent lysis and EC50 data from one of four representative experiments are shown in Figure 8 A. Based on the results of the four experiments, six antibodies with substitutions in the Fc region were selected and the dose response curves for each of those antibodies compared to wild type antibody (Figure 8B). The selection was based on a combination of improvement in lysis and EC50 data, as well as consistency from experiment to experiment. Based on the data, the following substitutions in combination with other substitutions have the most significant impact on ADCC enhancement:</p>S354R, P396I, F404W and G336W. Two of the top three variants (Figure 9) had the following substitutions: S354R, P396I, F404W, and G336W. Antibodies with this combination may result in improvement in both efficacy and potency.</p>Example 3</p>3D Analysis of Fc-CD 16 Interactions</p>Three dimensional models of Fc-CD 16 interaction were analyzed for the location of amino acid residues that demonstrated different patterns of CD 16 binding when amino acid substitutions were engineered at that position. CD 16 shows an asymmetrical pattern of binding to the two arms of the Fc domain. Fc residues were identified as \"hits\" if one or more substitutions at that position resulted in increased CD 16 binding, as \"tolerant\" if substitutions at that position had little effect on CD 16 binding, as \"intolerant\" if almost all substitutions at that position resulted in decreased CD 16 binding, and as \"limited\" if some substitutions at that position resulted in decreased CD 16 binding. The intolerant residues primarily clustered in close proximity to the Fc-CD 16 binding interface. The hits, residues that have identified mutations that increase CD 16 binding, \n\nprimarily clustered in three areas on the Fc. The first hit cluster is at residues that are located in area adjacent to the intolera"
