    "to model number 205 (sigmoidal dose-response model). From the curve generated, the concentration giving 50% inhibition is determined and reported. \n\n Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF)-stimulation of human whole blood </p> Whole blood was taken by venous puncture using heparinised vacutainers (Becton Dickinson) and diluted in an equal volume of RPMI 1640 tissue culture media </p>(Sigma). 100\u03bc\u0399 was plated in V-bottomed 96 well tissue culture treated plates. 2 hours after the addition of the inhibitor in 100\u03bc\u0399 of RPMI 1640 media, the blood was stimulated with MCSF (Peprotech; #300-25-1 OuG) at a final concentration of 50ng/ml and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% C0<sub>2</sub> for 22 hrs. MCP-1 levels were measured from cell- free supernatants by sandwich ELISA developed from MCP-1/CCL2 Duoset (R&amp;D Systems #DY279). Additional reagents required for ELISA were purchased from Sigma, (BSA: A3059, 10x PBS: D1408, Tween20: P5927) R&amp;D Systems, (colour reagent: #DY999 and stop solution: #DY994) and Costar (96-well EIA plates: #2592). Assays were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications: Cell-free supernatants were diluted 30:70 in reagent diluent before assay. All incubations except capture antibody were carried out with shaking at 550rpm. 3 washes were carried out between steps, and incubation times were blocking 1.5 hr, sample/standard and detection antibody incubations 2 hr, HRP incubation 30 min, colour development 20 min. </p>IC50 values were allocated to one of five ranges as follows: </p> Range A: IC50 &lt; 100nM </p> Range B: 100nM &lt; IC50 &lt;300nM </p> Range C: 300nM &lt; IC50 &lt;1000nM </p> Range D: 1000nM &lt; IC50 &lt;5000nM </p> Range E: IC50 &gt;5000nM </p> NT = not tested \n\n</p>Inhibitor activity versus Inhibitor activity versus</p>Example </p> CSF-1 MCP-1 </p> 1 A C </p> 2 B c </p> 3 B c </p> 4 B NT </p> 5 A D </p> 6 B C </p> 7 A B </p> 8 A B </p> 9 C A </p> 10 D A </p> 1 1 C A </p> 12 E NT </p> 13 D NT </p> 14 B C </p> 15 E NT </p> 16 D NT </p> 17 A NT </p> 18 B B </p> 19 A A </p> 20 D A </p> 21 A C </p> 22 A C </p> 23 C C </p> 24 C NT </p> 25 B C </p> 26 A C </p> 27 B A </p> 28 B A </p> 29 NT D </p> 30 B B </p> 31 B A </p> 32 B D </p> 33 B D \n\n34 A B</p>35 A C</p>36 C B</p>37 C A</p>38 E E</p>39 E E</p>40 E D</p>41 D NT</p>42 E C</p>43 E E</p>44 E E</p>45 D D</p>46 A C</p>47 A C</p>48 D C</p>49 D D</p>50 A B</p>51 A B</p>52 NT B</p>53 B NT</p>54 B NT</p>55 B B</p>56 B C</p>57 D D</p>58 E E</p>59 B NT \n</p>"
