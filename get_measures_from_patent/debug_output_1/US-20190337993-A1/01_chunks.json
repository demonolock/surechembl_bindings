    "ted assay plates or wells are contacted with serum from a patient and tested for the presence or absence of antibodies binding to the Nef-fusion protein comprising a target antigen or marker diagnostic for a medical condition. As the antigen concentration increases in the plates or wells the amount of antibody increases leading to a higher measured response. Typically an enzyme is attached to the secondary antibody which must be generated in a different species than primary antibodies (i.e., if the primary antibody is a rabbit antibody than the secondary antibody would be an anti-rabbit from goat, chicken, etc., but not rabbit). The substrate for the enzyme is added to the reaction that forms a colorimetric readout as the detection signal. The signal generated is proportional to the amount of target antigen present in the sample.</p>The antibody linked reporter used to measure the binding event determines the detection mode. A spectrophotometric plate reader may be used for colorimetric detection. Several types of reporters have been recently developed in order to increase sensitivity in an immunoassay. For example, chemiluminescent substrates have been developed which further amplify the signal and can be read on a luminescent plate reader. Also, a fluorescent readout where the enzyme step of the assay is replaced with a fluorophor tagged antibody is becoming quite popular. This readout is then measured using a fluorescent plate reader.</p>In some embodiments, a competitive binding assay based on the competition of labeled and unlabeled ligand for a limited number of antibody binding sites may be used. Competitive inhibition assays are often used to measure small analytes. Only one antibody is used in a competitive binding ELISA. This is due to the steric hindrance that occurs if two antibodies would attempt to bind to a very small molecule. A fixed amount of labeled ligand (tracer) and a variable amount of unlabeled ligand are incubated with the antibody. According to law of mass action, the amount of labeled ligand is a function of the total concentration of labeled and unlabeled ligand. As the concentration of unlabeled ligand is increased, less labeled ligand can bind to the antibody and the measured response decreases. Thus the lower the signal, the more unlabeled analyte there is in the sample. The standard curve of a competitive binding assay has a negative slope.</p>In certain other embodiments, a detection marker may be detected using exosome or Nef-fusion protein coated microbeads. In some embodiments, the microbeads are magnetic beads. In other embodiments, the beads are internally color-coded with fluorescent dyes and the surface of the bead is tagged with an exosome expressing a fusion protein of interest that can bind an antibody in a test sample. Antibody-bound exosomes may be directly labeled with a fluorescent tag or indirectly labeled with an anti-marker antibody conjugated to a fluorescent tag and may contain two sources of color, one from the bead and the other from the fluorescent tag. The beads can then pass through a laser and, on the basis of their color (and/or size), either get sorted or measured for color intensity, which is processed into quantitative data for each reaction.</p>Compositions Containing the Nef-Fusion ProteinA further aspect of the present application relates to compositions for treating a disease condition in accordance with the methods described herein. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a Nef-fusion protein containing a Nef-derived peptide fused to a protein of interest and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, the composition comprises an exosome comprising a Nef-fusion protein containing a Nef-derived peptide fused to a protein of interest as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>By \u201cpharmaceutically ac"
