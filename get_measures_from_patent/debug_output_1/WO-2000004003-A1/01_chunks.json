Upon stirring, the crude product precipitated as a yellow solid. The solid was sequentially stirred in Et2\u03b8 and 1 : 1 EtOAc:Et2\u03b8. Filtration gave the product as a pale yellow solid (1.3 g, 79%). MS (ES+) m/e 408 [M+H]+, 430 c) (S)-N-( 1 -(4,5-Dihydro-oxazol-2-yl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)- 1 -naphthamide (S)-N-(l-(2-hydroxyethylcarbamoyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)-l -naphthamide (0.50 g, 1.2 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (6 mL). Methoxy-carbonylsulfamoyl- triethylammonium hydroxide (0.32 g, 1.4 mmol) was added slowly. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes and heated to 70 \u00b0C for one hour. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solvent was removed in vacuo. Water was added to the residue and the pH adjusted to 5-6 using saturated aqueous NH4CI. Upon stirring, \n\nthe crude product precipitated as a yellow solid. The product was filtered and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel ( 100% EtOAc as eluant) to furnish the title compound (0.18 g, 38%).</p>\n  1H NMR (DMSO) - 8.96 (IH, d, J = 9.0 Hz), 8.19 (2H, d, J = 8.7 Hz), 7.95 (2H, dd, J = 14.3 Hz, J = 8.2 Hz), 7.69-7.61 (3H, m), 7.54-7.49 (2H, m), 7.41-7.34 (2H, m), 5.14-5.11 (IH, m), 4.34 (2H, t, J = 9.5 Hz), 3.83 (2H, t, J = 9.4 Hz), 3.43-3.32 (IH, m), 3.14 (IH, dd, J = 13.5 Hz, J = 11.0 Hz) MS (ES+) m/e 390 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, 779 IC50 (binding assay) = 0.56uM In order to use the present compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of humans and other mammals it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition.</p>\n  As used herein, \"treatment\" of a disease includes, but is not limited to prevention, retardation and prophylaxis of the disease.</p>\n  The present compound is useful for the treatment of diseases including but not limited to bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, eczema, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, pruritis and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>\n  The present compound and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered in a standard manner for the treatment of the indicated diseases, for example orally, parenterally, sub-lingually, dermally, transdermally, rectally, via inhalation or via buccal administration.</p>\n  The present compositions and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as syrups, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A syrup formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a liquid carrier for example, ethanol, peanut oil. olive oil, glycerine or water with a flavoring or coloring agent. Where the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing solid formulations may be used. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, terra",
    "well into 96-well black clear bottom sterile plates from Costar. The seeded plate was incubated overnight at 37^C in 5% CO2* On the day of the \n\nassay the cell medium was aspirated before addition of calcium dye loading solution consisting of; 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1.5 mM sulfinpyrazone from SIGMA and 4uM Fluo-3 AM dye from Molecular Probes in cell medium, thereafter the 96- well plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37^C. The loading solution containing dye was then aspirated and replaced with fresh solution without dye after which the plate was incubated for a further 10 mins at 37\u00b0C.</p>\n  This solution was aspirated and cells were washed with assay buffer (Kreb's Ringer Henseleit pH 7.4 containing ImM CaC , I mM MgC-2, 1.5 mM sulfinpyrazone and 1.0 mg/mL Gelatin) after aspirating the wash, lOOuLs of fresh assay buffer was added to all the wells and the plate was incubated for five minutes at 37^C before transferring to the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) instrument. The assay and data acquisition were initiated by addition of 50 uLs of sample diluted to a relevant concentration in assay buffer. After 2 mins 75 uLs of human Eotaxin, from PeproTech Inc., diluted to an appropriate concentration in assay buffer with 1 mg mL BSA (no gelatin) was added to the plate and data was acquired for an additional 1.5 mins. Concentration response data for compounds showing inhibition of calcium mobilization were performed in the presence of 33 nM Eotaxin to obtain the IC50 values. IC50 is the concentration of compound needed to inhibit 50% of the Eotaxin response. Animal model for the in vivo evaluation of CCR-3 antagonists (Gonzalo, J.A. et al, Immunity, 1996, 4, 1.) BALs were obtained from Guinea Pigs (+ compound) 24 h after ovalbumin (OA) exposure to eotaxin administered via inhalation. The animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation and exsanguinated. The lungs were lavaged with 50 ml of DulBecco's PBS (5x1 Occ), which was aspirated after a gentle chest massage. The BAL fluid was spun down and the pellet was resuspended in 0.25% NaCl to lyse residual erythrocytes. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended again in 0.9% NaCl. After a total cell count, slides were prepared and stained. The cells were differentiated into eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes by counting a minimum of 200 cells and expressing the results as a percentage of total cells.</p>\n  Alternatively, OA sensitized Guinea Pigs (+ compound) were exposed to OA via inhalation 24 h after OA exposure and lungs were obtained as described above and assessed for eosinophil infiltration.</p>\n  The following examples are illustrative but not limiting of the embodiments of the present invention. \n\n Formulations for pharmaceutical use incorporating the present compound can be prepared in various forms and with numerous excipients.
