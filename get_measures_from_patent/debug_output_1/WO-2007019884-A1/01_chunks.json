    "lkyl\" means a non-aromatic, partially or completely saturated cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing 3 to 8 atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.</p>\n  \"Effective amount\" or \"Therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of at least one compound for formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, that significantly inhibits tumor growth.</p>\n  \"Halogen\" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably bromine, chlorine or fluorine.</p>\n  \"Hetero atom\" means an atom selected from N, O and S, preferably N. [ If the hetero atom is N, it can be present as -NH- or -N-lower alkyl-. If the hetero atom is S, it can be present as S, SO or SO<sub>2</sub>. \n\n \"Heteroaryl\" means an aromatic heterocyclic ring system containing up to two rings. Preferred heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, thienyl, furyl, indolyl, pyrrolyl, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, oxazolyl, thiaxolyl, quinolinyl, pyrimidinyl, imidazolyl and tetrazolyl.</p>\n  \"Heterocycle\" or \"heterocyclyl\" means a 3- to 10-membered saturated or partially unsaturated non-aromatic monovalent cyclic radical having from one to 3 hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur or a combination thereof. Examples of preferred heterocycles are piperidine, piperazine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine.</p>\n  \"IC<sub>5</sub>o\" refers to the concentration of a particular compound according to the invention required to inhibit 50% of a specific measured activity. IC50 can be measured, inter alia, as is described in Example 26, infra.</p>\n  \"Pharmaceutically acceptable ester\" refers to a conventionally esterified compound of formula I having a carboxyl group, which esters retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of formula I and are cleaved in vivo (in the organism) to the corresponding active carboxylic acid. Examples of ester groups which are cleaved (in this case hydrolyzed) in vivo to the corresponding carboxylic acids (R<sup>40</sup>C(=O)OH) are lower alkyl esters which may be substituted with NR<sup>41</sup>R<sup>42</sup> where R<sup>41</sup> and R<sup>42</sup> are lower alkyl, or where NR<sup>41</sup>R<sup>42</sup> taken together form a monocyclic aliphatic heterocycle, such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, N-methylpiperazine, etc.; acyloxyalkyl esters of the formula R<sup>40</sup>C(=O)OCHR<sup>43</sup>OC(=O)R<sup>44</sup> where R<sup>43</sup> is hydrogen or methyl, and R<sup>44</sup> is lower alkyl or cycloalkyl; carbonate esters of the formula R<sup>40</sup>C(=O)OCHR<sup>43</sup>OC(=O)OR<sup>45</sup> where R<sup>43</sup> is hydrogen or methyl, and R<sup>45</sup> is lower alkyl or cycloalkyl; or aminocarbonylmethyl esters of the formula R<sup>40</sup>C(=O)OCH<sub>2</sub>C(=O)NR<sup>41</sup>R<sup>42</sup> where R<sup>41</sup> and R<sup>42</sup> are hydrogen or lower alkyl, or where NR<sup>41</sup>R<sup>42</sup> taken together form a monocyclic aliphatic heterocycle, such as pyrrolidine, piperidi"
