Based on this calculation, receptor occupancy values for ADG106 at different dose levels were obtained and plotted. As shown in FIG. 5, the estimated receptor occupancy of ADG106 was 58% at 0.03mg/kg, 82% at 0.1mg/kg, 93% at 0.3mg/kg, and 98% at the 1mg/kg dose level. As shown in Table 8, receptor occupancy of Wu Ruilu mab at its maximum tolerated clinical dose (MTD, 0.1 mg/kg) was estimated to be 64%, while Wu Tuolu mab at its maximum clinically administered dose (MAD, 10 mg/kg) was estimated to be 98%. Thus, ADG106 can achieve high receptor occupancy at doses 10-fold lower than its DLT dose. </p><p id=\"p0561\" num=\"0556\">TABLE 8 receptor occupancy of ADG106 compared to Wu Ruilu and Wu Tuolu mAb.</p><p id=\"p0562\" num=\"0557\"></p><p id=\"p0563\" num=\"0558\">* MTD was used for Wu Tuolu monoclonal antibody, and MAD was used for Wu Tuolu monoclonal antibody.</p><p id=\"p0564\" num=\"0559\"><u>Pharmacokinetics (PK)</u></p><p id=\"p0565\" num=\"0560\">ADG106 pharmacokinetics in subjects at 0.03mg/kg, 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, 1mg/kg, 1.5mg/kg, 3mg/kg, 5mg/kg, and 10mg/kg dose levels were determined. Blood samples for PK analysis were collected on cycle 1 (day 1: 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours before dosing and after infusion; once on days 8, 15 and 22), on day 1 of the subsequent cycle before dosing and 2 hours after infusion and at the end of treatment. The concentration of ADG106 was determined from serum samples using a validated ELISA method in which anti-ADG 106 idiotypic mouse mono",

In all PK/TK studies, both men and women had a proportional increase in overall exposure and peak dose to ADG106 when evaluating PK/TK. In GLP toxicity studies, no adverse effects were observed in monkeys dosed repeatedly weekly for one month at doses up to 200 mg/kg. </p><p id=\"p0590\" num=\"0585\">Monkey serum samples were assayed for anti-ADG 106 drug antibody (ADA) levels using validated Electrochemiluminescence (ECL). All samples were first subjected to ADA screening analysis. Study samples with results below the screening cutoff reported ADA negative. If the screening test result is positive, the sample is analyzed in a validation test. All samples confirmed positive were reported as positive.</p><p id=\"p0591\" num=\"0586\">ADA is present in individual animals and is associated with increased clearance of ADG106 and decreased exposure. These ADA positive titers and higher ADG106 clearance rates were observed primarily in 50mg/kg (4/10 animals) and 100mg/kg (1/10 animals), but not in the 200mg/kg treated group of animals.</p><p id=\"p0592\" num=\"0587\">Example 4 biomarker Studies</p><p id=\"p0593\" num=\"0588\"><u>Immune effects of ADG106 treatment</u></p><p id=\"p0594\" num=\"0589\">To study the immune effects of ADG106 treatment, peripheral blood was collected prior to initiation of treatment and at each ADG106 treatment cycle. The expression of Ki-67 was analyzed by flow cytometry to detect T cell proliferation. Soluble CD137 (sCD 137) levels in plasma can be detected by a validated MSD-based electrochemiluminescence method.</p><p id=\"p0595\" num=\"0590\">As shown in figure 8A, a four to five fold increase in the frequency of CD8+ T cell proliferation was observed following ADG106 treatment in one patient (patient code R011). At 21 days post ADG106 infusion, CD8+ T cell frequency peaked at the first blood draw, with approximately 25% of CD8+ T cells expressing Ki-67. After ADG106 treatment, the frequency of Ki-67+ CD4+ T cells is increased by about one-fold. Approximately 40 days after treatment, the frequencies of Ki-67+ CD8+ T cells and Ki-67+ CD4+ T cells are reduced to baseline levels. This effect was similar to that observed in pembrolizumab-treated patients (fig. 8B). In some individuals treated with higher dose levels of ADG106, peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed increased Ki67 expression (fig. 9A-9B). Fig. 10A-10B show CD137+ CD4+ and CD137+ CD8+ T cell populations in certain individuals treated with different levels of ADG 106. </p><p id=\"p0596\" num=\"0591\"><u>Pharmacodynamic (PD)/prognostic biomarker for ADG106</u></p><p id=\"p0597\" num=\"0592\">Blood samples were collected at different time points before and after ADG106 treatment for exploratory biomarker studies. These biomarkers include serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF \u03b1, IFN \u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, etc.) and soluble CD 137. Peripheral blood immune cell profiles, such as absolute cell counts of circulating T cells, natural Killer (NK) cells, B cells, effector T cell subsets and memory T cell subsets, were analyzed with a flow cytometer using corresponding antibodies against the biomarkers. The dynamic changes of peripheral T cell clones were analyzed by TCR sequencing. The expression of CD137 and its ligands, PD-L1 and/or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, etc., in archived tumor tissues or fresh biopsies is analyzed using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method.</p><p id=\"p0598\" num=\"0593\">As shown in figure 11, ADG106 treatment significantly increased soluble CD137 (sCD 137) levels in the plasma of all tested patients, indicating t",

Increased CD137 expression following treatment with ADG106 indicates that ADG106 is involved in the activation of CD137 signaling pathways in CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that sCD137 and mCD137 may be prognostic biomarkers for ADG106 treatment. </p><p id=\"p0599\" num=\"0594\">As shown in figure 13, ki67+ CD8+ T cells tended to increase more after one cycle of ADG106 treatment in patients with stable disease than in patients with progressive disease.

Tumor growth and animal body weight were monitored every 2-3 days.</p><p id=\"p0603\" num=\"0598\">As shown in fig. 17A and 17C, ADG106 had anti-tumor activity in the L5178-S T lymphoma model, whereas the L5178-R T lymphoma model was resistant to ADG106 treatment. CD137 ligand expression was detected in two murine T-lymphomas, L5178-R and L5178-S cells. Lymphoma cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-CD 137 ligand antibody or isotype control antibody by incubation on ice for 30-60 minutes in the dark. After washing away unbound antibody, the sample was analyzed by flow cytometry. "
