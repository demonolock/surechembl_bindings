    "the other read mapped in two portions, spanning a putative insertion/ deletion. For both algorithms, an identical putative normal from the CGP panel of tumours was nominated that has been used in all cell lines studied without available matched normal tissue. Significant post processing filtering against various panels of normal was subsequently undertaken to eliminate as many germline single nucleotide polymorphisms as possible. These include the 1000 genomes database, DB SNP, and an internal panel of CGP normal. Following these steps missense variants were annotated using the FATHM algorithm (Cancer Genome Project) as to potential functional consequence of the variant.</p>Combination (genome-drug) therapeutic screen approachesManual \"single dose\" combination screening was undertaken using 96 well formats. Cells were plated on day 1 in previously optimized seeding densities in 180\u00b5l if media. On day 2 20 \u00b5l of a 10X concentration of media from a stock of drugs was added. Cells were then allowed to grow for 72hrs or 6 days and fixed at the end of the assay. Drug wells were compared to DMSO treated control wells.</p>Single agent high throughput 5 point viability screening was undertaken in 384 well formats [18] using robotic liquid handling with fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde and staining for viability with Syto60 nucleic acid dye (Invitrogen) (see below). Single agent dose response curves were derived for each library of 85-95 drugs according to the experiment used, and log IC50 or area under the curve (AUC) metrics were derived for each library compound in each cell line according to a previously derived formula [18]. Using this data various 2-drug synergy was measured with a Delta AUC metric.</p>A binary event matrix was compiled for the cell lines in the mesothelioma screen by aggregating copy number and exome data and this was used as input classifiers for genomic correlation. Data from this therapeutic screen was then analysed using a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) [18] to annotate the sensitizing effect of genotype on dose response. The results are presented as a volcano plot demonstrating significance of the interaction (above a Benjamin Hochberg false discovery threshold) and magnitude of effect size.</p>Analyses of TCGA dataFrequency of BAP1 truncating mutations in various cancer types is based upon data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/.</p>Cell culture293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate. Human mesothelioma cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% sodium pyruvate (H2369, H2373, H2461, H2591, H2595, H2722, H2731, H2795, H2803, H2804, H2869, H290, H513, IST-MES1, MPP-89, MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052, NCI-H2452, NCI-H226, NCI-H28) or Dulbecco's"
