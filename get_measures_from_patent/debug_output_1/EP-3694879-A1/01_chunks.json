Nos. 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et al). </p> A wide variety of antibody /immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds can be employed so long as the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically binds to PDL1. Such frameworks or scaffolds include the five main idiotypes of human immunoglobulins, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and include immunoglobulins of other animal species, preferably having humanized aspects. </p> In one aspect, the invention pertains to a method of generating non-immunoglobulin based antibodies using non-immunoglobulin scaffolds onto which CDRs of the invention can be grafted. Known or future non-immunoglobulin frameworks and scaffolds may be \n\n employed, as long as they comprise a binding region specific for the target PDLl protein. Known non-immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds include, but are not limited to, fibronectin (Compound Therapeutics, Inc., Waltham, Mass.), ankyrin (Molecular Partners AG, Zurich, Switzerland), lipocalin (Pieris Proteolab AG, Freising, Germany), small modular immuno -pharmaceuticals (Trubion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Seattle, Wash.), maxybodies (Avidia, Inc., Mountain View, Calif), Protein A (Affibody AG, Sweden), and affilin (gamma- crystallin or ubiquitin) (Scil Proteins GmbH, Halle, Germany). </p>Suitably, the antibodies of the invention specifically bind to PDLl and is characterized by one or more of the following parameters: </p> (i) binds to human PDLl with a dissociation constant (KD) of less thanlO nM, particularly less than 5 nM, particularly less than 1 nM, particularly less than 500 pM, more particularly less than 100 pM, preferably less than 50 pM, more preferably less than 10 pM, more preferably 5 pM, in particular as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), particularly wherein said antibody is an scFv; </p> (ii) binds to human PDLl with a K<sub>off</sub> rate of 10 <sup>3</sup> s<sup>_1</sup> or less, or 10 <sup>4</sup> s<sup>_1</sup> or less, or 10 <sup>5</sup> s<sup>_1</sup> or less as measured by SPR, particularly wherein said antibody is an scFv; </p> (iii) binds to human PDLl with a K<sub>&lt;</sub>,<sub>n</sub> rate of at least 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>_1</sup>s<sup>_1</sup> or greater, at least 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>^ 1</sup> or greater, at least 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>^ 1</sup> or greater, at least 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>^ 1</sup> or greater as measured by SPR, particularly wherein said antibody is an scFv;</p>(iv) is cross-reactive with Macaca fascicularis (Cynomolgus) PDLl, in partilular binds to Cynomolgus PDLl with a KD of less than 5 nM, particularly less than 1 nM, particularly less than 500 pM, more particularly less than 100 pM, preferably less than 10 pM as measured by surface plasmon resonance, particularly wherein said antibody is an scFv; is non-cross reactive to Mus musculus PDLl, in particular as measured by SPR; and/or </p> (v) does not bind to human PDL2, in particular as measured by SPR. \n\n As used herein, the term \"affinity\" refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody \"arm\" interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the stronger the affinity. </p> \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., of an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\", \"bind to\", \"binds to\" or \"binding to\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity that reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., an antibody fragment and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity, i.e. binding strength are described in the following. </p> The term \"Ka<sub>SS0C</sub>\", \"Ka\" or \"Ko<sub>n</sub>\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \"Kdi<sub>s</sub>\", \"Kd\" or \"Koff\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. In one embodiment, the term \"KD\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). The \"KD\" or \"KD value\" or \"K<sub>D</sub>\" or \"K<sub>D</sub> value\" according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by using surface-plasmon resonance assays using a MASS-1 SPR instrument (Sierra Sensors). To measure affinity, an antibody specific for the Fc region of rabbit IgGs (Bethyl Laboratories, Cat. No. A120-111A) is immobilized on a sensor chip (SPR-2 Affinity Sensor, High Capacity Amine, Sierra Sensors) using a standard amine-coupling procedure. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies in B-cell supematants are captured by the immobilized anti-rabbit IgG antibody. A minimal IgG concentration in the B-cell supematants is required to allow sufficient capture. After capturing \n\n of the monoclonal antibodies, human PDLl (Peprotech) is injected into the flow cells for 3 min at a concentration of 90 nM, and dissociation of the protein from the IgG captured on the sensor chip is allowed to proceed for 5 min. After each injection cycle, surfaces are regenerated with two injections of 10 mM Glycine-HCl. The apparent dissociation (kd) and association (ka) rate constants and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) are calculated with the MASS-1 analysis software (Analyzer, Sierra Sensors) using one-to-one Langmuir binding model and quality of the fits is monitored based on relative Chi<sup>2</sup> (Chi<sup>2</sup> normalized to the extrapolated maximal binding level of the analyte), which is a measure for the quality of the curve fitting. The smaller the value for the Chi<sup>2</sup> the more accurate is the fitting to the one-to-one Langmuir binding model. Results are deemed valid if the response units (RU) for ligand binding are at least 2% of the RUs for antibody capturing. Samples with RUs for ligand binding with less than 2% of the RUs for antibody capturing are considered to show no specific binding of PDLl to the captured antibody. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>0ff</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al, J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). </p> Suitably, the affinity of the antibody of the invention to PDLl may be higher than the affinity of PDLl to PD-1. It will be appreciated that a higher affinity of the PDLl antibody as compared to the affinity of PDLl to PD-1 may be particularly useful for dissociating or neutralizing the pre-formed PD-l/PDLl complexes. In one embodiment, the PDLl antibody of the present invention neutralizes PD-l/PDLl interaction. In another embodiment, the PDLl antibody of the present invention neutralizes B7-1/PDL1 interaction. Suitably, the affinity of the PDLl antibody of the present invention to PDLl may be comparable to or higher than the affinity of avelumab to PD-1. In one embodiment, the PDLl antibody of the present invention neutralizes PD-l/PDLl interaction with potency equal to or higher than avelumab. In a further embodiment, the PDLl antibody of the present invention neutralizes B7-1/PDL1 interaction with potency equal to or higher than avelumab. The binding affinity of an antibody may be determined, for example, by the dissociation constant (KD). A stronger affinity is represented by a lower KD, while a weaker affinity is represented by a higher KD. </p> Thus, in a suitable embodiment, the antibody of the invention may have a KD of between 1 to 50,000 pM, 1 to 40,000 pM, 1 to 30,000 pM, 1 to 20,000 pM, 1 to 10,000 pM, 1 \n\n to 5,000 pM, 1 to 2,500 pM, 1 to 1,000 pM, 1 to 750 pM, 1 to 500 pM, 1 to 250 pM, 1 to 100 pM, 1 to 50 pM, 1 to 10 pM.

    "ring between the void volume (VO) and the total permeation volume (VT) of a specific column. Measurements by SE-HPLC are performed on a Chromaster HPLC system (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) equipped with automated sample injection and a UV detector set to the detection wavelength of 280 nm. The equipment is controlled by the software EZChrom Elite (Agilent Technologies,</p>Version 3.3.2 SP2) which also supports analysis of resulting chromatograms. Protein samples are cleared by centrifugation and kept at a temperature of 4-6\u00b0C in the autosampler prior to injection. For the analysis of scFv samples the column Shodex KW403-4F (Showa Denko Inc., #F6989202) is employed with a standardized buffered saline mobile phase (50 mM sodium-phosphate pH 6.5, 300 mM sodium chloride) at the recommended flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The target sample load per injection was 5 \u03bcg. Samples are detected by an UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm and the data recorded by a suitable software suite. The resulting chromatograms are analyzed in the range of V0 to VT thereby excluding matrix associated peaks with &gt;10 min elution time. </p>The term \"recognize\" as used herein refers to an antibody that finds and interacts (e.g., binds) with its conformational epitope. </p> The terms \"compete\" or \"cross-compete\" and related terms are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody to interfere with the binding of other antibodies or binding agents to PDL1 in a standard competitive binding assay. </p> The ability or extent to which an antibody is able to interfere with the binding of another antibody or binding molecule to PDL1, and therefore whether it can be said to cross-compete according to the invention, can be determined using standard competition binding assays. One particularly suitable quantitative cross-competition assay uses a FACS- or an AlphaScreen- based approach to measure competition between the labelled (e.g. His tagged, biotinylated or radioactive labelled) an antibody or fragment thereof and the other an antibody or fragment thereof in terms of their binding to the target. In general, a cross-competing antibody or fragment thereof is for example one which will bind to the target in the cross-competition assay such that, during the assay and in the presence of a second antibody or fragment thereof, the recorded displacement of the immunoglobulin single variable domain or polypeptide \n\n according to the invention is up to 100% (e.g. in FACS based competition assay) of the maximum theoretical displacement (e.g. displacement by cold (e.g. unlabeled) antibody or fragment thereof that needs to be cross-blocked) by the to be tested potentially cross-blocking antibody or fragment thereof that is present in a given amount. Preferably, cross-competing antibodies or fragments thereof have a recorded displacement that is between 10% and 100%, more preferred between 50%&gt; and 100%. </p> The term \"epitope\" means a protein determinant capable of s",

Cells were washed twice with 100 \u03bc\u0390 PBS by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bc\u0390 of serial dilutions prepared in staining buffer (PBS, 2% BCS heat inactivated, 2 mM EDTA) of the tested rlgGs as well as of the control IgG avelumab and ranging from 2,000 to 0.128 ng/ml. After 1 h incubation at 4\u00b0C on a nutating mixer, cells were wash 3 times with 100 \u03bc\u0390 staining buffer and centrifugation steps of 5 min at 400 x g. Then, cells treated with rabbit IgGs were resuspended in 100 \u03bc\u0390 of staining buffer containing 2 \u03bcg/ml of goat anti-rabbit IgG APC labelled and cells treated with avelumab (human IgGl) were resuspended in 100 \u03bc\u0390 of staining buffer containing 2 \u03bcg/ml of goat anti-human IgG APC labelled. Plates were incubated 1 h at 4\u00b0C on a nutating mixer. Plates were washed 3 times with 100 \u03bc\u0390 of staining buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 50 \u03bc\u0390 of staining buffer. Finally, APC signal of 20,000 events per well was analyzed by flow cytometry using a Novocyte flow cytometer system (ACE A Bioscience).

Selectivity for PDLl versus PDL2 by SPR \n\n Humanized scFvs were tested for binding to PDL2 by SPR analysis on a T200 device (Biacore, GE Healthcare). In this experiment, Fc tagged human PDL2 was captured using the Human Antibody Capture kit from GE healthcare. After each analyte injection cycle the CM5 sensor chip was regenerated and new antigen was captured. The scFvs were injected as analyte at a concentration of 180 nM diluted in running buffer for 5 min and dissociation of the protein was allowed to proceed for 12 min.

An antibody specific for the Fc region of human IgGs was immobilized on a sensor chip (CM5 sensor chip, GE Healthcare) by amine- coupling. For all formats, with the exception of the Fc containing Morrison formats, PDLl-Fc chimeric protein from different species were captured by the immobilized antibody. Threefold serial dilutions of the molecules specific for PDL1 (0.12-90 nM) were injected into the flow cells for three minutes and dissociation was monitored for 10 minutes. After each injection cycle, surfaces were regenerated with one injection of a 3 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution. The apparent dissociation (k<sub>d</sub>) and association (k<sub>a</sub>) rate constants and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) were calculated using one-to-one Langmuir binding model. </p>Affinity to CD 137 of the different species was determined using the identical setup as for PDL1 with the exception that CD137-Fc chimeric proteins from different species were captured by the immobilized antibody. </p> The Fc containing formats were directly captured by the antibody specific for the Fc region of human IgGs. Two-fold serial dilutions of PDL1 extracellular domain or CD137 extracellular domain ranging from 90 to 0.35 nM were tested for binding to the IgG captured on the biosensor chip. After each injection cycle, surfaces were regenerated with one injection of a 3 M MgC12 solution. </p> Affinity of molecules to serum albumin (SA) of the different species was determined by SPR measurements using a Biacore T200 device (GE Healthcare). SA was directly coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using amine coupling chemistry. After performing a regeneration scouting and surface performance test to find best assay conditions, a dose response was measured and obtained binding curves were double- referenced (empty reference channel and zero analyte injection) and fitted using the 1 : 1 \n\n Langmuir model to retrieve kinetic parameters. The assay was run in a 1 X PBS-Tween buffer at pH 5.5. </p>Results: </p> The measurements of the binding kinetics for the humanized constructs show a difference in binding affinity for PDLl when comparing the CDR and structural grafts (STR) of clone 33-03-G02 the STR graft shows a 20-fold improvement in affinity compared to the CDR graft of the same clone (PR0885 versus PROl 126 in Table 26). The CDR graft derived from clone 37-20-B03 (PR0997) shows approximately two-fold higher affinity when compared to the STR graft of clone 33-03-G02. The binding affinities for the CDR graft of 33-03-G02 are similar to the binding affinity of the parental scFv when they are combined into different multispecific formats (compare PRO830 to PR0885, PR0951 , PROl 123, PROl 124, PR0963, PR0966, PRO1057, PRO1058, PRO1059 and PRO1060 in Table 26). The scFv derived from both clones show nearly identical affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey PDLl (see PR0977 and PRO830 in Table 26). \n\n</p>TABLE 26.

    "tively and CD 137 on T-cells. By applying anti-PDLlxCD137 molecules two T-cell regulatory signaling pathways were targeted concomitantly: inhibition of the inhibitory PD-1/PDL1 pathway as well as activation of the CD 137 pathway via formation of an immunological synapse mediated by the bispecific anti-PDLlxCD137 molecule (PR0885). The activation of T-cells was assessed by the secretion of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and compared to the effect mediated by PDLl inhibition mediated by the benchmarking reference antibody avelumab. In addition, the anti-PDLl scFv, PR0997, was tested and compared to avelumab in the same experimental setup. </p> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from fresh human whole blood by means of density gradient centrifugation. Then, PBMC were depleted for NK cells using anti-CD56 antibody and the MACS cell separation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Next, 100,000 PBMCs per well were added to the 96-well plate, followed by the addition of serial dilutions of PR0885, PR0997 and avelumab in assay buffer containing SEA at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. After 96 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C and 5% C0<sub>2</sub>, cell supernatants were harvested and human Interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in the culture supernatants were quantified using the IL-2 human ELISA MAX assay from BioLegend according to kit instructions. IL-2 concentrations were interpolated from a IL-2 standard curve, back-calculated and plotted against avelumab and PR0885 concentrations for calculation of EC50 values. </p> As shown in FIG. 9, IL-2 was secreted by T-cells following concomitant blockade of</p>PD-1 /PDLl interaction and stimulation of CD 137 by the addition of the bispecific molecule PR0885. When compared to avelumab, PR0885 showed higher T cell activation and better potency (PR0885, EC<sub>50</sub> = 39.92 ng/ml; avelumab, EC<sub>50</sub> = 69.89 ng/ml, Table 29). This finding demonstrates that the bispecific anti-PDLlxCD137 scDb PR0885 is able to induce stronger T cell stimulation than mere PDLl blockade by avelumab. Moreover, the high-</p>122 \n\n affinity anti-PDLl scFv PR0997 was found to be more potent in stimulation of T-cells than avelumab (PR0997, EC<sub>50</sub> = 40.86 ng/ml; avelumab, EC<sub>50</sub> = 90.18 ng/ml, Table 29). </p>TABLE 29.
