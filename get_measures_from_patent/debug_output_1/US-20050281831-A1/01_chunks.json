    "insertions, and substitutions in particular, are not expected to produce radical changes in the characteristics of the Ig-like domain or domains of the chimeric VEGF receptor protein. However, when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of the substitution, deletion, or insertion in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect will be evaluated by routine screening assays. For example, an Ig-like domain variant typically is made by site-specific mutagenesis of the nucleic acid encoding the intact chimeric VEGF receptor protein, expression of the variant nucleic acid in recombinant cell culture, purification of the variant chimeric VEGF receptor protein from the cell culture and detecting the ability of the variant chimeric VEGF receptor protein to specifically bind to a VEGF ligand. Binding assays which can be routinely employed to determine if a particular alteration or alterations in an Ig-like domain or domains affects the capability of the chimeric VEGF receptor protein to bind to and inhibit the activity of VEGF are described both in the Examples below and in the article by Park et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:25646-25654 (1994) which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. </p> Thus, the activity of a variant chimeric VEGF receptor protein may be screened in a suitable screening assay for the desired characteristic. For example, a change in the ability to specifically bind to a VEGF ligand can be measured by a competitive-type VEGF binding assay. Modifications of such protein properties as redox or thermal stability, hydrophobicity, susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, or the tendency to aggregate with carriers or into multimers are assayed by methods well known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. </p> 2. Recombinant Expression </p> The chimeric VEGF receptor proteins of the present invention are prepared by any technique, including by well known recombinant methods. Likewise, an isolated DNA is understood herein to mean chemically synthesized DNA, cDNA, chromosomal, or extrachromosomal DNA with or without the 3\u2032- and/or 5\u2032-flanking regions. Preferably, the desired chimeric VEGF receptor protein herein is made by synthesis in recombinant cell culture. </p> For such synthesis, it is first necessary to secure nucleic acid that encodes a chimeric VEGF receptor protein of the present invention. DNA encoding a flt-1 or KDR receptor may be obtained from vascular endothelial cells by (a) preparing a cDNA library from these cells, (b) conducting hybridization analysis with labeled DNA encoding the flt-1 or KDR receptor or fragments thereof (up to or more than 100 base pairs in length) to detect clones in the library containing homologous sequences, and (c) analyzing the clones by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleic acid sequencing to identify full-length clones. If full-length clones are not present in a cDNA library, then appropriate fragments may be recovered from the various clones using the nucleic",
    "flt-1 PCR products into the mutagenized FLT4 encoding construct resulted in flt-1/FLT4 chimeric receptor constructs. Specifically, constructs were prepared which possessed the entire FLT4 receptor sequences except that the FLT4 Ig-like domains 1-3 were replaced with the Ig-like domains 1-3 of the flt-1 receptor (construct flt-1 (1,2,3)/FLT4) or that the FLT4 Ig-like domain 2 was replaced with the Ig-like domain 2 of the flt-1 receptor (construct flt-1 (2)/FLT4). For flt-1 (1,2,3)/FLT4, FLT4 sequence encoding amino acids N33 through E324 was replaced by flt-1 sequences encoding S35 through S325. Creation of the cloning sites resulted in a change of I325 of FLT4 to R. For flt-1 (2)/FLT4, FLT4 sequence encoding S128 through I224 was replaced by flt-1 sequence encoding I124 through R224. This also changes FLT4 amino acids N33 and I326 to S and R, respectively and added T36. Sequencing confirmed the authenticity of these chimeras. FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 show the entire amino acid sequences of the intact FLT4 receptor, the entire amino acid sequence of the chimeric receptor encoded by the flt-1 (1,2,3)/FLT4 construct and the entire amino acid sequence of the chimeric receptor encoded by the fit-1 (2)/FLT4 construct, respectively. </p> After preparation of these expression constructs, 293 cells were transfected with the constructs via DEAE-Dextran and transiently-expressing cells were analyzed for the ability to bind to the VEGF ligand. To detect binding of the VEGF ligand, a saturation binding assay was performed on transiently-expressing 293 cells expressing the intact FLT4 receptor, the flt-1 domain 2/FLT4 chimeric receptor, the flt-1 domains 1-3/FLT4 chimeric receptor, or the intact flt-1 receptor. Specifically, 2.5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells were incubated with increasing amounts of <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF (specific activity of 56.9\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cpm/\u03bcg) in a final volume of 0.2 mls of buffer C (50/50 media with 0.1% BSA and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.3) or 4 hrs at 4\u00b0 C. with slight agitation. The cell mixture was then layered over a 0.75 ml cushion of 30% sucrose, centrifuged for 10 minutes at maximum speed, and the pellet was recovered and counted in a gamma counter. Because 293 cells possess some flt-1-like VEGF binding, non-transfected cells were also used and the background counts were subtracted out from the counts recovered for the transfected cells. The amount of counts added and the recovered counts bound were then subjected to scatchard analysis. </p> The results of these experiments demonstrated that, as expected, the cells expressing the intact FLT4 receptor did not specifically bind the VEGF ligand. However, cells expressing the flt-1 domain 2/FLT4 chimeric receptor or the flt-1 domains 1-3/FLT4 chimeric receptor did specifically bind the VEGF ligand specifically and tightly. The Kds are approximately 10.2 pM+/\u22121.1 pM and 10.4 pM+/\u22123.4 pM, respectively, for the flt-1 domain 2/FLT4 chimeric receptor and the flt-1 domains 1-3/FLT4 chimeric receptor. These val",
    " transiently expressing these chimeric receptors 60-72 hours post-transfection. Tyrosine phosphorylation assays were performed essentially as described in Park et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:25646-25654 (1994). The transiently expressing 293 cells were deprived of serum 16-18 hrs prior to stimulation by a given factor. Cells were stimulated with FLT4 ligand (VH1.4.5; VEGF-CNRP) at a concentration of 400 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml VEGF, or 0.5 nM PLGF for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Following removal of the stimulation media, the cells were twice washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer. The lysate was cleared of cellular debris and the receptors were immunoprecipitated using JTL.1, a polyclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the FLT4 receptor (see Lee et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 93:1988-1992 (1996)). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to western gel/blot analysis using the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, N.Y.). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with an ABC kit according to manufacturers directions (Vector Laboratories). </p> To establish stable cell lines, each of the chimeric constructs was co-transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene via calcium phosphate precipitation into NIH 3T3 cells. Clones proliferating in the presence of G418 were screened for their ability to bind to VEGF. Clones expressing either the flt-1 (1,2,3)/FLT4 or flt-1 (2)/FLT4 chimera were analyzed in a cell binding assay to determine the Kd for VEGF by titrating a trace amount of <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF<sub>165 </sub>(approx. 5000 cpm/ml final) with increasing amounts of cold VEGF<sub>165</sub>. First the adherent cells were washed with cold binding buffer C (DMEM/F12 media with 0.2% BSA and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), then <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF<sub>165 </sub>and the cold competitor, each in 0.5 mls buffer C, were added simultaneously. The cells were then placed at 4\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. After aspirating off the binding buffer, the cells were washed with cold PBS and then twice with cold PBS containing 2M NaCl. Finally, the cells were lysed with 0.25M NaOH and the entire lysate was counted in a gamma counter. Results were analyzed and the Kds calculated using the Scatchard analysis program New Ligand (Genentech, Inc.). </p> NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing either the fit-1 (1,2,3)/FLT4 or the fit-1 (2)/FLT4 chimeric receptors were plated in 12-well format at 50,000 cells/well in low glucose DMEM media containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco BRL), 2 mM Glutamine, 2.5 microgram/ml Fungizone (Gibco BRL), and 200 micrograms/ml G418 (Gibco BRL). Following 18-24 hours of serum starvation in media containing 0.5% FBS, growth factors or 10% FBS were added. The concentration of VEGF<sub>165 </sub>added ranged from 5 pg/ml to 300 ng/ml; PIGF<sub>152 </sub>concentrations were between 5.12 ng/ml and 3.2 micrograms/ml; the concentration of VEGF-C was 40 ng/ml and 4 micrograms/ml. Following stimulation for 12-16 h"
