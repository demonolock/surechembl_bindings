    "al compositions comprising the compounds are useful for treating short bowel syndrome. The methods for treating short bowel syndrome provide administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the benzamide-containing peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formula (I), (II) or (III)) or one or more of the constrained alkene peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formulat (IV), (V) or (VI)) described herein to treat short bowel syndrome in the patient. The methods for treating short bowel syndrome provide administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the benzamide-containing peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formula (I), (II) or (III)) or one or more of the constrained alkene peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formula (IV), (V) or (VI)) described herein to treat short bowel syndrome in the patient. In one embodiment, the methods provide administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of the benzamide-containing peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formula (I), (II) or (III)) or one or more of the constrained alkene peptide compounds (e.g., a peptide compound of Formula (IV), (V) or (VI)) described herein.</p>The compounds described herein may be tested in a variety of receptor binding assays using methodologies generally known to those skilled in the art. Such assays include those described herein.</p>GLP-1 receptor binding assay. GLP-1 receptor binding activity and affinity may be measured using a binding displacement assay in which the receptor source is RINm5F cell membranes, and the ligand is [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-1. Homogenized RINm5F cell membranes can be incubated in 20 mM HEPES buffer with 40,000 cpm e25I]GLP-1 tracer, and varying concentrations of test compound for 2 hours at 23\u00b0 C. with constant mixing. Reaction mixtures can be filtered through glass filter pads presoaked with 0.3% PE1 solution and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Bound counts can be determined using a. scintillation counter. Binding affinities can be calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.).</p>GLP-1 adenylate cyclase assay (Functional Assay). The GLP-1 receptor mediated adenylate cyclase activation can be measured using, for example, an HTRF (Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence) cell-based cAMP assay kit (CisBio) as known in the art.</p>Glucose lowering assay. Suitable test animals (e.g., NIH/Swiss mice) can be fasted (e.g., 2-hr) prior to the assay. Pre-treatment glucose blood concentration can be determined. Compound or vehicle can be injected at zero time, and samples can be withdrawn at fixed intervals (e.g., 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min) for blood glucose determination. A suitable blood glucose measurement device is the One Touch\u00ae Ultra\u00ae (LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, Calif.). Results can be presented as the integrated area under the curve (\u201cAUC\u201d)"
