    "rker gene can be placed in tandem with a sequence encoding OXTR under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of OXTR polynucleotide.</p>Alternatively, host cells which contain a OXTR polynucleotide and which express OXTR can be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip-based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein. For example, the presence of a polynucleotide sequence encoding OXTR can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding OXTR. Nucleic acid amplification-based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides selected from sequences encoding OXTR to detect transformants which contain a OXTR polynucleotide.</p>A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of OXTR, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radio-immunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on OXTR can be used, or a competitive binding assay can be employed.</p>A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and can be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding OXTR include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, sequences encoding OXTR can be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and can be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of labeled nucleotides and an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6. These procedures can be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega, and US Biochemical). Suitable reporter molecules or labels which can be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, and fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like.</p>Expression and Purification of PolypeptidesHost cells transformed with OXTR polynucleotides can be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the protein from cell culture. The polypeptide produced by a transformed cell can be secreted or contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. As will be understood by those of skill in th",
    "dy.</p>The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as \u201cscreening assays\u201d) for identifying compounds which can be used for the treatment of hematological and cardiovascular diseases, disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, COPD, asthma, genito-urological disorders and inflammation diseases. The methods entail the identification of candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules or other molecules) which bind to OXTR and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the biological activity of OXTR or its expression and then determining which of these compounds have an effect on symtoms or diseases regarding the hematological and cardiovascular diseases, disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, COPD, asthma, genito-urological disorders and inflammation diseases in an in vivo assay.</p>Candidate or test compounds or agents which bind to OXTR and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the activity or the expression of OXTR are identified either in assays that employ cells which express OXTR on the cell surface (cell-based assays) or in assays with isolated OXTR (cell-free assays). The various assays can employ a variety of variants of OXTR (e.g., full-length OXTR, a biologically active fragment of OXTR, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of OXTR). Moreover, OXTR can be derived from any suitable mammalian species (e.g., human OXTR, rat OXTR or murine OXTR). The assay can be a binding assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the binding of a test compound or a known OXTR ligand to OXTR. The assay can also be an activity assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the activity of OXTR. The assay can also be an expression assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the expression of OXTR mRNA or OXTR protein. The various screening assays are combined with an in vivo assay entailing measuring the effect of the test compound on the symtoms of hematological and cardiovascular diseases, disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, COPD, asthma, genito-urological disorders and inflammation diseases.</p>In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which bind to or modulate the activity of a membrane-bound (cell surface expressed) form of OXTR. Such assays can employ full-length OXTR, a biologically active fragment of OXTR, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of OXTR. As described in greater detail below, the test compound can be obtained by any suitable means, e.g., from conventional compound libraries. Determining the ability of the test compound to bind to a membrane-bound form of OXTR can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the test compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the test compound to the OXTR expressing cell can be measured by detecting the labeled compound in a complex. For example, the test compound can be labelled ",
    "c Test Using OXTR Specific AntibodiesParticular OXTR antibodies are useful for investigating signal transduction and the diagnosis of infectious or hereditary conditions which are characterized by differences in the amount or distribution of OXTR or downstream products of an active signaling cascade.</p>Diagnostic tests for OXTR include methods utilizing antibody and a label to detect OXTR in human body fluids, membranes, cells, tissues or extracts of such. The polypeptides and antibodies of the present invention are used with or without modification. Frequently, the polypeptides and antibodies are labeled by joining them, either covalently or noncovalently, with a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and have been reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent agents, chemiluminescent agents, chromogenic agents, magnetic particles and the like.</p>A variety of protocols for measuring soluble or membrane-bound OXTR, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on OXTR is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed.</p>Example 9Purification of Native OXTR Using Specific AntibodiesNative or recombinant OXTR is purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for OXTR. In general, an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the anti-TRH antibody to an activated chromatographic resin.</p>Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway N.J.). Likewise, monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The antibody is coupled to the resin, the resin is blocked, and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>Such immunoaffinity columns are utilized in the purification of OXTR by preparing a fraction from cells containing OXTR in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of whole cells or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation (with or without addition of detergent) or by other methods well known in the art.
