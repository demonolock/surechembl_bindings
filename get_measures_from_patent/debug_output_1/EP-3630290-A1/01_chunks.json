    "us with \"antigen\" and \"epitope\", and refers to a site (e.g. a contiguous stretch of amino acids or a conformational configuration made up of different regions of non-contiguous amino acids) on a polypeptide macromolecule to which an antigen binding moiety binds, forming an antigen binding moiety- antigen complex. Useful antigenic determinants can be found, for example, on the surfaces of tumor cells, on the surfaces of virus-infected cells, on the surfaces of other diseased cells, on the surface of immune cells, free in blood serum, and/or in the extracellular matrix (ECM). </p>By \"specific binding\" is meant that the binding is selective for the antigen and can be discriminated from unwanted or non-specific interactions. The ability of an antigen binding moiety to bind to a specific antigenic determinant can be measured either through an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other techniques familiar to one of skill in the art, e.g. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique (analyzed e.g. on a BIAcore instrument) (Liljeblad et al., Glyco J 17, 323-329 (2000)), and traditional binding assays (Heeley, Endocr Res 28, 217- 229 (2002)). In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antigen binding moiety to an unrelated protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antigen binding moiety to the antigen as measured, e.g., by SPR. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding moiety that binds to the antigen, or an antibody comprising that antigen binding moiety, has a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of &lt; 1 \u03bc\u039c, &lt; 100 nM, &lt; 10 nM, &lt; 1 nM, &lt; 0.1 nM, &lt; 0.01 nM, or &lt; 0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\"8</sup> M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\"8</sup> M to 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, e.g., from 10<sup>\"9</sup> M to 10<sup>\"13</sup> M). </p>\"Affinity\" refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., a receptor) and its binding partner (e.g., a ligand). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1: 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., an antigen binding moiety and an antigen, or a receptor and its ligand). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), which is the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants (k<sub>Qff</sub> and k<sub>on</sub>, respectively). Thus, equivalent affinities may comprise different rate constants, as long as the ratio of the rate constants remains the same. Affinity can be measured by well established methods known in the art, including those described herein. A particular method for measuring affinity is Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). \n\n \"Reduced binding\", for example reduced binding to an Fc receptor, refers to a decrease in affinity for the respective interaction, as measured for example by SPR. For clarity, the term includes also reduction of the affinity to zero (or below the detection limit of the analytic method), i.e. complete abolishment of the interaction. Conversely, \"increased binding\" refers to an increase in binding affinity for the respective interaction. </p>\"CD3\" refers to any native CD3 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans), non-human primates (e.g. cynomolgus monkeys) and rodents (e.g. mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses \"full-length,\" unprocessed CD3 as well as any form of CD3 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of CD3, e.g., splice variants or allelic variants. In one embodiment, CD3 is human CD3, particularly the epsilon subunit of human CD3 (CD3s). The amino acid sequence of human CD3s is shown in "
