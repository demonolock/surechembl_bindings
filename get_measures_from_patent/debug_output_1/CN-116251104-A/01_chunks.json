    "delegated Selleck biotechnology company has customized a drug library containing 129 molecules (which have been demonstrated or potentially induce mitochondrial autophagy activation). An in vitro OA model was constructed with IL-1\u03b2 stimulated SW1353 cell line for 48 hours as a positive control, cells without any treatment applied as a negative control, while various drugs were added at a concentration of 10 \u03bcm in each group, the negative control, the positive control and the cell supernatants of each drug-treated group were collected after 48 hours, the concentration of OA marker Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 in each group of cell supernatants was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the lowest 10 groups with MMP3 concentration in the range between the negative control and the positive control were used as a rescreen range (as shown in fig. 2A).</p>2. And (3) re-screening: also, an in vitro OA model was constructed by stimulating SW1353 cell line with IL-1. Beta. For 48 hours as a positive control, and cells without any treatment were used as a negative control, while 10 drugs determined by preliminary screening were added at a concentration of 10. Mu.M in each group, RNA of the negative control, positive control and cells of each drug-treated group was collected after 48 hours, and the expression levels of MMP3, MMP13, proteoglycan (ACAN) of each group of cells was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. As shown in FIG. 2B, belumosudil (KD 025, catalog number: S7936) is the only drug capable of simultaneously and effectively reducing MMP3 and MMP13 and improving ACAN expression level in 10 drugs.</p>3. Determination of optimal concentration in vitro experiments: KD025 was diluted with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40. Mu.M gradient concentration, and cells were treated separately, and the SW1353 cell line was stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 for 48 hours to construct an in vitro OA model as a positive control, and cells without any treatment were used as a negative control, RNA from the negative control, positive control and KD025 treatment groups of cells were collected after 48 hours, and the expression levels of MMP3, MMP13, proteoglycan (ACAN) were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR for each group of cells, and the KD025 treatment SW1353 cells of 2.5. Mu.M was determined to be effective in reducing MMP3, MMP13 expression levels while increasing ACAN expression levels (as shown in FIG. 2B). As shown in fig. 2C and fig. 2D, as demonstrated by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western Blot, KD025 of 2.5 \u03bc\u039c can significantly inhibit OA-related markers MMP3, MMP13, thrombospondin-specific metallopeptidase 5 (ADAMTS 5), increase ACAN expression, promote the increase of expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker LC3B, and induce mitochondrial autophagy.</p>Example 3 animal experiments demonstrate the effect of oral feeding KD025 on alleviation of OA progression in mice</p>1. Experimental grouping: (1) group of sham operations: sham (Sram); (2) simple surgery group: a DMM; (3) group of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) as gastric lavage solvent after DMM surgery: CMC-Na; (4) DMM post-operative lavage KD025 (100 mg/kg in CMC-Na) group: KD025. Left knee OA models of 8-week old mice were first constructed by medial meniscal Destabilization (DMM) (4 groups, n=5), while Sham groups were similarly subjected to skin and joint capsule dissection followed by suturing, except for medial meniscal tibial ligaments.</p>2. The experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) mice were respectively perfused with KD025 (100 mg/kg) at 4 weeks after surgery, and gait analysis was performed on the 4 groups of mice after 4 weeks; all mice were sacrificed and left knee joints of 4 groups of mice were dissected, collected, analyzed for micro-CT, paraffin embedded, sectioned and HE, safranin O-fast green stained and immunofluorescent stained, respectively.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 3. DMM procedure resulted in a relatively increased swing period of the left hind limb in mice, while lavage KD025 significantly alleviated this change, and lavage CMC-Na did not have this effect (as shown in FIG. 3F); DMM surgery significantly increased the knee joint osteophyte in mice (as shown in FIG. 3A, B), narrowed the joint space (as shown in FIG. 3C), increased bone volume fraction BV/TV and bone trabecular thickness, decreased bone trabecular space (as shown in FIG. 3A, D, E, G), meaning that subchondral bone osteogenesis was enhanced, and tissue section staining also showed increased cartilage degeneration; MMP3 and MMP13 expression in cartilage is increased and ACAN is obviously reduced (as shown in FIG. 3H); whereas KD025 lavage significantly alleviates the above OA performance caused by DMM compared to CMC-Na. From the above, oral KD025 (100 mg/kg) significantly alleviates DMM-induced cartilage degeneration and OA progression in mice.</p>Example 4KD025 animal toxicity assay</p>Experimental grouping: group of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) as gastric lavage solvent after DMM surgery: CMC-Na; DMM post-operative lavage KD025 (100 mg/kg in CMC-Na) group: KD025. Left knee OA models of 8 week old mice were first constructed by medial meniscal Destabilization (DMM) (4 groups, n=5).</p>2. Starting to perfuse the mice in the experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) with the stomach KD025 (100 mg/kg) respectively after 4 weeks after the operation, and recording the weight changes of the mice in the experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) after 4 weeks of the stomach respectively; collecting a mouse blood sample by taking blood from eyeballs, and taking upper serum for liver and kidney function detection; after the mice were sacrificed, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen organs of both groups of mice were dissected and collected, and the general morphology of the organs of both groups of mice was observed.</p>The experimental results are shown in FIG. 4. As shown in fig. 4B, there was no significant difference in body weight change between the two groups of mice; as shown in fig. 4C, D, there was no significant difference between the liver and kidney function indexes of the mice in the experimental group and the control group; as shown in fig. 4A, the general morphology of the organs of the two groups of mice was not significantly different, and the tissue of each organ was embedded and sliced and then HE stained, and the tissue and cytopathological characteristics of each organ of the two groups of mice were observed to be not significantly different.</p>Finally, it should be noted that the above embodiments are only for illustrating the technical solution of the present invention and not for limiting the scope of the present invention, and although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that modifications or equivalent substitutions can be made to the technical s"
