Mu.M gradient concentration, and cells were treated separately, and the SW1353 cell line was stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 for 48 hours to construct an in vitro OA model as a positive control, and cells without any treatment were used as a negative control, RNA from the negative control, positive control and KD025 treatment groups of cells were collected after 48 hours, and the expression levels of MMP3, MMP13, proteoglycan (ACAN) were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR for each group of cells, and the KD025 treatment SW1353 cells of 2.5. Mu.M was determined to be effective in reducing MMP3, MMP13 expression levels while increasing ACAN expression levels (as shown in FIG. 2B).\n* As shown in fig. 2C and fig. 2D, as demonstrated by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western Blot, KD025 of 2.5 \u03bc\u039c can significantly inhibit OA-related markers MMP3, MMP13, thrombospondin-specific metallopeptidase 5 (ADAMTS 5), increase ACAN expression, promote the increase of expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker LC3B, and induce mitochondrial autophagy.\n* The experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) mice were respectively perfused with KD025 (100 mg/kg) at 4 weeks after surgery, and gait analysis was performed on the 4 groups of mice after 4 weeks; all mice were sacrificed and left knee joints of 4 groups of mice were dissected, collected, analyzed for micro-CT, paraffin embedded, sectioned and HE, safranin O-fast green stained and immunofluorescent stained, respectively.\n* Starting to perfuse the mice in the experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) with the stomach KD025 (100 mg/kg) respectively after 4 weeks after the operation, and recording the weight changes of the mice in the experimental group (KD 025) and the control group (CMC-Na) after 4 weeks of the stomach respectively; collecting a mouse blood sample by taking blood from eyeballs, and taking upper serum for liver and kidney function detection; after the mice were sacrificed, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen organs of both groups of mice were dissected and collected, and the general morphology of the organs of both groups of mice was observed."}
