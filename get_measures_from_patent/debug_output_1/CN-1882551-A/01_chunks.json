    "f the present invention or compound of the present invention.</p>Compound of the present invention is measured as the method for available this area of application of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV activity inhibitor.It is as follows to suppress constant measuring: connect the fluorescence measurement test and adopt substrate Gly-Pro-AMC, it is ruptured to discharge fluorescence AMC leavings group by DPP-IV.The kinetic parameter of describing this reaction is as follows: K\n          <sub>m</sub>=50 \u03bc M; k\n          <sub>Cat</sub>=75s\n          <sup>-1</sup>k\n          <sub>Cat</sub>/ K\n          <sub>m</sub>=1.5 * 10\n          <sup>6</sup>M\n          <sup>-1</sup>s\n          <sup>-1</sup>In the reaction volume of 1000 \u03bc L altogether, typical reaction contains the 50pM enzyme of having an appointment, and (100mM HEPES, pH 7.5,0.1mg/mlBSA) for 50 \u03bc MGly-Pro-AMC and damping fluid.Being released in the 96 orifice plate photofluorometers of AMC monitored continuously with the excitation wavelength of 360nm and the emission wavelength of 460nm.Under these conditions, in 30 minutes, producing about 0.8 \u03bc M AMC under 25 \u2103.Employed enzyme is soluble (diaphragm area is striden in eliminating and the tenuigenin extends) human body protein that produces in baculovirus expression system (Bac-To-Bac, Gibco BRL) in this research.The kinetic constant that is used for hydrolysis Gly-Pro-AMC and GLP-1 is found out according to the literature value that is used for the nature enzyme.For measuring the dissociation constant of compound, the solution of inhibitor in DMSO is added in the reaction that contains enzyme and substrate (final DMSO concentration is 1%), all experiments are at room temperature carried out with above-mentioned standard reaction condition.For measuring dissociation constant (K\n          <sub>i</sub>), speed of reaction is measured by non-linear decline to the Michaelis-Menton equation that is used to compete inhibition.Error in repeating dissociation constant is usually less than twice.\n        </p>The compound of following embodiment especially has the activity that suppresses the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme in above-mentioned test, have the IC that is lower than about 1 \u03bc M usually\n          <sub>50</sub>, this result indicates that compound is in the intrinsic activity aspect the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV activity inhibitor.\n        </p>The dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is a cell surface proteins, hinting many biological functions, it has tissue distribution (intestines, kidney, liver, pancreas, placenta, thymus gland, spleen, epithelial cell, blood vessel endothelium, lymph and medullary cell, serum) and clearly tissue and cell type expression level widely.DPP-IV is the same with T cell activation mark CD26, at external many immunomodulatorys of rupturing, internal secretion and neuroscience peptide.This has advised the useful effect of this peptase in the various diseases process in people or other species.</p>Therefore, target compound is used for various preventions or treats the method for following disease, symptom and situation.</p>Type ii diabetes and related symptoms: people determine that fully incretin GLP-1 and GIP are in vivo by the rapid inactivation of DPP-IV, research and preliminary clinical trial with the DPP-IV deficient mice show that DPP-IV suppresses to have increased the steady-state concentration of GLP-1 and GIP, causes the glucose tolerance of improving.Be similar to GLP-1 and G"
