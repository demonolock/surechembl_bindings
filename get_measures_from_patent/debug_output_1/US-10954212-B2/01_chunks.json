    "llowing oral administration in a rat.</p>As shown in FIG. 5 and Table 10, after 4.75 mg conjugate was intranasally administered to rats, plasma concentrations of d-methylphenidate released from the conjugate are substantially flat from about 0 to about 1 hour following intranasal administration in a rat. However, after 2.39 mg unconjugated d-methylphenidate was intranasally administered to rats, plasma concentrations of d-methylphenidate released from the conjugate are dramatically increased from about 0 to about 0.1 hour following intranasal administration in a rat. Conjugated d-methylphenidate was about 6% AUC and 5% C<sub>max </sub>of unconjugated d-methylphenidate.</p>Similar to FIG. 5, FIG. 6 and Table 10 show that after 4.75 mg conjugate was injected intravenously to rats, plasma concentrations of d-methylphenidate released from the conjugate are substantially flat from about 0 to about 2 hours following intravenous administration in a rat. However, after 2.39 mg unconjugated d-methylphenidate was injected intravenously to rats, plasma concentrations of d-methylphenidate released from the conjugate are dramatically increased from about 0 to about 0.1 hour following intravenous administration in a rat. Conjugated d-methylphenidate was about 17% AUC and 12% C<sub>max </sub>of unconjugated d-methylphenidate.</p>TABLE 10PK comparison of prodrugs of d-methylphenidate with unconjugatedd-methylphenidate dosed intranasally and intravenously in rats.Intranasal (N)Intravenous (N)PKd-MPH-CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-d-MPH-CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-Parameternicotinoyl-L-Serd-MPHnicotinoyl-L-Serd-MPHAUC<sub>0-1h</sub>\u200267.4 (8)1110.8 (9)\u200251.0 (8)\u2002312.6(h \u00d7 ng/\u2002(9)mL)AUC<sub>0-2h</sub>n/an/a93.5 (8)\u2002534.9(h \u00d7 ng/\u2002(9)mL)C<sub>max </sub>(ng/118.9 (10)2561.6 (10)62.8 (10)541.8mL)(10)T<sub>max </sub>(h)\u20030.1 (10)\u2002\u20030.1 (10)\u20020.9 (10)\u20030.4(10)</p>A study was conducted in humans to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 32 mg of d-MPH-CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-nicotinoyl-L-Ser (liquid, dissolved in water) compared with 36 mg of Concerta\u00ae (tablet) after oral administration under fasted conditions (the dose of 32 mg of d-MPH-CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-nicotinoyl-L-Ser contains about 13.9 mg of d-methylphenidate, which was about 10.9% lower compared to the about 15.6 mg of d-methylphenidate in 36 mg of Concerta\u00ae).
