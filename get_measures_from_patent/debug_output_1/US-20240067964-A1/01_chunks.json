Cells were plated at a density of 35,000 per well and transfected using electroporation with 0.0625 \u03bcM, 0.125 \u03bcM, 0.25 \u03bcM, 0.500 \u03bcM, or 1.000 \u03bcM concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and apo(a) mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Apo(a) primer probe set hAPO(a)12kB was used to measured mRNA levels. Apo(a) mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\u00ae. Results are presented as percent inhibition of apo(a), relative to untreated control cells.</p><p id=\"p-0390\" num=\"0390\">The results of each of the studies are depicted in the Tables presented below with each table representing a separate experiment. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of each oligonucleotide is also presented in the Tables. Apo(a) mRNA levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in antisense oligonucleotide treated cells. The potency of the newly designed oligos was compared with the benchmark oligonucleotide ISIS 144367.</p><p id=\"p-0391\" num=\"0000\"><tables id=\"TABLE-US-00014\" num=\"00014\"><table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"7\"><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"28pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"35pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"21pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"5\" colwidth=\"35pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"6\" colwidth=\"21pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"7\" colwidth=\"35pt\" align=\"center\"/><thead><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 14</entry></row><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"/></row><row><entry/><entry>0.0625</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>1.000</entry><entry>IC<sub>50</sub></entry></row><row><entry>ISIS No</entry><entry>\u03bcM</entry><entry>\u03bcM</entry><entry>\u03bcM</entry><entry>\u03bcM</entry><entry>\u03bcM</entry><entry>(\u03bcM)</entry></row><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"/></row></thead><tbody valign=\"top\"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"7\"><colspec colname=\"1\"",
