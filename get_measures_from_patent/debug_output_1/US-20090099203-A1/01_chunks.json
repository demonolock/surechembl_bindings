    "large bowel, breast and prostate.</p>Worldwide, the incidence and mortality rates of certain types of cancer (of stomach, breast, prostate, skin, and so on) have wide geographical differences which are attributed to racial, cultural, and especially environmental influences. There are over 200 different types of cancer but the four major types, lung, breast, prostate and colorectal, account for over half of all cases diagnosed in the UK and US. Prostate cancer is the fourth most common malignancy among men worldwide, with an estimated 400,000 new cases diagnosed annually, accounting for 3.9 percent of all new cancer cases.</p>Current options for treating cancers include surgical resection, external beam radiation therapy and/or systemic chemotherapy. These are partially successful in some forms of cancer, but are not successful in others. There is a clear need for new therapeutic treatments.</p>Compound (I) is exemplified and described in WO96/40681 as Example 36. WO96/40681 claims the endothelin receptors described therein for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The use of Compound (I) in the treatment of cancers and pain is described in WO04/018044.</p>Compound (I) has the following structure:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20090099203A1-20090416-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/92183006/US/20090416/A1/020090/09/92/03/US20090099203A1-20090416-C00001.TIF\"/></p>and is also known as zibotentan.</p>In WO04/018044 an endothelin human receptor binding assay is described. The pIC<sub>50 </sub>(negative log of the concentration of compound required to displace 50% of the ligand) for Compound (I) at the ET<sub>A </sub>receptor was 8.27 [8.23-8.32] (n=4). Compound (I) is thus an excellent endothelin antagonist.</p>WO96/40681 discloses in general terms, certain pharmaceutically compositions that may be used to formulate compounds of the invention described therein (for example see Example 71).</p>WO04/018044 describes a lactose formulation of Compound (I):</p>Compound (I);</p>Lactose monohydrate (filler);</p>Croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant);</p>Povidone (binder);</p>Magnesium stearate (lubricant);</p>Hypromellose (film coat component);</p>Polyethylene glycol 300 (film coat component); and</p>Titanium dioxide (film coat component).</p>This tablet formulation, based on a lactose monohydrate filler and with a white film coat, was developed for use in Phase I and II clinical studies, but proved unsuitable for use in late-stage development because:\nthe tablets were prone to capping and edge-damage;the active ingredient was subject to hydrolytic degradation;the active ingredient was subject to degradation on exposure to light; andstrict controls must be applied to lactose monohydrate to minimize the risk of TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy) transmission, as described in EMEA/410/01 Rev. 2 Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary M"
