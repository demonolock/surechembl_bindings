    "5151-9 (1998)], traumatic brain injury [P. G. Sullivan et al., Exp Neurol., February 2000; 161, 631-7 (2000)], and experimental dopamine neuron degeneration [K. Matsuura et al., Exp. Neurol., 146, 526-351 (1997)]. In order for CsA to exert a protective effect after neural insult, it must be available at the site of injury. However, due to the blood-brain barrier, CsA shows only very limited penetration into the brain when administered systemically, and its best beneficial effects are seen if the blood-brain barrier is compromised [H. Uchino et al., Brain Res., 812, pp. 216-26 (1998); P. G. Sullivan et al., Exp. Neurol., 161, pp. 631-7 (2000)].</p>While the present invention is not bound by any particular theory, it appears that at least some of the effects of CsA on cells of the nervous system occur independently of calcineurin inhibition. Some of the inventors have previously shown that non-immunosuppressive peptidic analogues of CsA, which lack a calcineurin-binding domain, display neurotrophic activity in neural cell culture which is equal to that of CsA [J. P. Steiner et al., Nat. Med., 3, pp. 421-8 (1997)].</p>A number of types of mammalian cyclophilins have been identified and cloned, cyclophilins A, B, C, D, and cyclophilin-40 [Snyder and Sabatini, Nat. Med. 1:32-37 (1995); Friedman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:6815-6819 (1993)].</p>Cyclophilin B possesses an N-terminal signal sequence that directs translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. The 23 kD cyclophilin C is found in the cytosol of the cell. Cyclophilin D, at 18 kD, appears to target its actions in the mitochondria, and cyclophilin-40 is a component of the inactivated form of a glucocorticoid receptor. Cyclophilin A is a 19 kD protein, which is abundantly expressed in a wide variety of cells. Like the other cyclophilins, cyclophilin A not only binds the immunosuppressive agent CsA, but it also possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and protein folding or \u201cchaperone\u201d activities. PPIase activity catalyzes the conversion of proline residues in a protein from the cis to the trans conformation [Fischer, et al., Biomed. Biochem. Acta 43:1101-1112 (1984)].</p>Since cyclophilin A was first identified as the receptor for CsA, the effects of the CsA:cyclophilin interaction have been well documented. Cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilin A with a dissociation constant in the range of 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>mol/L, a value representing a relatively high degree of affinity [Handschumacher et al., Science 226:544 (1984)]. Knowledge about the interaction between drug and protein spawned a number of drug discovery efforts. Initially, the focus was on identifying novel immunosuppressive drugs that would mimic the effects of CsA without displaying its dose-limiting side-effects.</p>The field, however, lacks appreciation of the usefulness of cyclophilin-binding compounds for treating disease states, injuries and other abnormal conditions involving the central nervous system and other parts of the body. For therapeutic application in disorders of the central nervous system, for example, cyclophilin-binding compounds would need to penetrate from the bloodstream into the brain to bind to cyclophilin and exert biological effects. Cyclosporin A, however, generally displays poor penetration into the central nervous system after systemic administration, and therefore possess only low therapeutic potential for CNS applications if the blood-brain barrier is intact. See Uchino et al.; Sullivan et al., supra. Therefore, there exists need for safe and effective compositions and methodologies for treating disease states, injuries and other abnormal conditions involving the central nervous system and other organs by use of cyclophilin-binding compounds. These needs have gone unresolved until the development of the present inventions.</p>Researcher",
