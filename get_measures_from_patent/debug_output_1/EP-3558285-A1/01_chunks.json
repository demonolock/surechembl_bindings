    "-4,4-diphenylimidazolidin-l- yl)methyl]-N-methyl-l,3-thiazole- \n\n 4-carboxamide 514.2 </p>Assay for Inhibition of Microbial Expressed HIV Protease </p> Inhibition of Escherichia coli expressed wild-type HIV-1 protease protein was carried out with a peptide substrate [Val-Ser-Gln-Asn-( naphtyl)Ala-Pro-Ile-Val]. The inhibitor compound was preincubated with HIV-1 protease enzyme in assay buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% BSA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Peptide substrate was added to 400 \u03bc\u039c in a total volume of 20 containing 20 pM HIV-1 protease (final) after which the reaction was incubated for 1 hour at 30\u00b0C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of formic acid and HIV protease inhibitor indinavir to 0.012% and 150 nM final concentrations, respectively. Product formation was determined after separation of product and substrate on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (Aligent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) connected to an API 4000\u2122 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Pte. Ltd., Concord Ontario, Canada) with multiple reaction monitoring (transitions were 644.5/428.9 and 615.4/422.2 (M1/M3) for product and indinavir respectively). The extent of inhibition of the reaction was determined from the peak area of the products. Analysis of the products, independently synthesized, provided quantitation standards and confirmation of the product composition. Representative compounds of the present invention exhibit inhibition of HIV-1 protease in this assay. Ic50's refer to the 50% inhibition of the cleavage of a peptide substrate by hiv protease. </p>Table 2 shows data obtained from the above described assays for the Compounds herein. Data shown in the table reflects the mean of at least two independent experiments. \n\n TABLE 2 </p>\n Example HIV Protease Example HIV Protease Example HIV Protease Number IC50 (nM) Number IC50 (nM) Number IC50 (nM)</p>32 19.30 64 86.89 </p> While the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present invention, with examples provided for the purpose of illustration, the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual variations, adaptations and/or modifications that come within the scope of the following claims. \n</p>"
