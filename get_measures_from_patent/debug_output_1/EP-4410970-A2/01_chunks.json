    "o-Fisher) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To test viability and fitness, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with RNA transcripts of a specific HCV recombinant using Lipofectomine 2000 (Thermo-Fisher)<sup>14</sup>. The transfection cultures were sub-cultured and viral passages were performed as described<sup>23</sup>. Supernatants from indicated time-points were collected, filtered and stored at -80\u00b0C. Viral infectivity titers were determined by focus forming unit (FFU) assays and reported as log<sub>10</sub>FFU/ml from triplicate dilutions, as described<sup>15</sup>.</p>ORF sequence obtained by Sanger or next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of viruses derived from cell culture supernatants was performed as reported previously, with minor modifications<sup>14,20,24</sup>, and by using 6a specific primers (see Table 6). To determine the viral UTR sequences, the inventors performed 5'RACE procedure on culture supernatants (5'UTR<sup>14</sup>) and on total cellular RNA or liver tissue (viral minus-strand RNA, 3'UTR<sup>14</sup>).</p>Viral stocks and treatment assaysFor antiviral concentration-response assays, the inventors used second-passage supernatant viral stocks of HK2(FL)-17m and HK6a(FL)-12m viruses (Table 1), and previously generated stocks of the TNcc virus<sup>15,18</sup>; antivirals were purchased from Acme Bioscience and diluted in DMSO<sup>16,18,25</sup>. All concentration-response treatment experiments were performed using established methods<sup>16,18,26</sup>. For half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) value calculations, a sigmoidal concentration-response curve was fitted using GraphPad Prism 6<sup>18,26</sup>.</p>For long-term DAA treatments, Huh7.5 cells were infected with second-passage supernatants of HK2(H77_3'XSLI)-17m or HK6a(FL)-12m viruses (Table 1, Figure 1F). Treatments were initiated when 90% of HCV-antigen positive cells were observed by immunostaining. Treatments were carried out in T25 flasks, and drugs were diluted in medium at the indicated concentration. Drugs were added every 2-3 days when cells were split. HCV RNA levels were determined using supernatants collected at indicated time points as described<sup>18</sup>. The percentage of HCV positive cells, at indicated time-points, was determined by immunostaining, and supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00b0C for further analysis. At day 25 after initiation of treatment, cultures with no detectable HCV positive cells were divided into 2 flasks, and one of the replicates was cultured without drug. These untreated cultures were followed for 2 weeks and if no HCV positive cells were detected by immunostaining, the infection was considered cleared.</p>Full-length ORF amplification and NGS analysisTotal RNA from cell culture supernatants were homogenized and lysed with TRIzol LS (Thermos Fisher Scientific)/Chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). An equal volume of colorless upper aqueous phase was transferred to 100% Ethanol, then the solution was loaded onto Zy",
    "K6acc (MG717930), respectively (Figure 1B; Table 1), were highly efficient, with fast spread after transfection, and peak titers of 4.6 and 4.7 log<sub>10</sub>FFU/ml (Figure 1E). The viruses were genetically stable after second passage with peak titers of 4.4 and 4.3 log<sub>10</sub>FFU/ml (Table 1).</p>Taken together, the inventors succeeded in generating highly efficient adapted full-length cell culture systems for two genotype 6a prototype strains, HK2 and HK6a.</p>Efficacy of NS5A and NS5B inhibitors against HCV genotype 6a virusesDAA-based treatment regimens for patients with genotype 6 include NS5A- and NS5B-inhibitors<sup>11</sup>. Since in vitro studies of DAA are limited for this genotype<sup>28</sup>, the efficient 6a full-length infectious systems provided valuable tools to evaluate the efficacy of inhibitors in the context of the complete viral life cycle, which the inventors compared to genotype 1a, strain TN<sup>15</sup>.</p>Efficacy of NS5A inhibitors.The inventors tested all six NS5A-inhibitors approved for the treatment of HCV11; however, only ledipasvir, velpatasvir and most recently pibrentasvir have been approved for genotype 611. Genotype 6a strains HK2 and HK6a responded similarly to each of the tested NS5A-inhibitors. Nevertheless, both strains were less sensitive to ledipasvir and ombitasvir compared to 1a-TN. In contrast, daclatasvir, elbasvir, velpatasvir, and pibrentasvir efficiently inhibited 1a and 6a viruses with relatively small differences in EC50 (Table 2; Figure 7).</p>Efficacy of NS5B inhibitors.Among nucleotide inhibitors (NI), only sofosbuvir is approved for clinical use for all HCV genotypes11. Another NI, MK-3682, has undergone clinical phase II studies7. The inventors found that sofosbuvir and MK-3682 similarly inhibited genotypes 1a and 6a (Table 2; Figure 8). Among non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNI), the thumb-domain-site-1 inhibitor beclabuvir was less potent against 6a strains than against 1a-TN. Thumb-domain-site-2 inhibitor lomibuvir, previously found to be ineffective against genotypes 2a, 2b and 3a<sup>16,18</sup> did not inhibit 6a viruses, at the highest concentration tested (~4000 nM). Clinically approved Palm-domain-site-1 inhibitor dasabuvir, recommended for treatment of genotype 111, was less effective against 6a viruses. Finally, Palm-domain-site-2 inhibitor HCV-796 similarly inhibited TN and HK2, but showed less efficacy against HK6a (Table 2; Figure 8).</p>Escape of HCV genotype 6a viruses from velpatasvir, pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir treatmentsThe inventors initially investigated the effect of combination treatment and the intrinsic barrier to resistance of 6a strains towards sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, a pan-genotypic regimen<sup>11</sup>.</p>Velpatasvir/sofosbuvir treatment of 6a strains induced viral clearance.Full-length viruses were cultured with velpatasvir (10 nM) and sofosbuvir (570 nM), individually, or combined (Figure 2A, Figure 9A). The combination treatment was highly efficient "
