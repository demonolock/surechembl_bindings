This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/663,147, filed on Sep. 15, 2000, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/800,593 filed Feb. 18, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,505, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/317,450 filed Oct. 4, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,982.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  Laminins are a family of basement membrane proteins which function in cell differentiation, adhesion, and migration, in addition to being true structural components (Tryggvason K, Curr. Opn. Cell Biol., 1993, 5:877-882, this and all following references are hereby incorporated by reference). The laminin molecule is a cross-shaped heterotrimer consisting of one heavy chain (\u2248400 kd) and two light chains, \u03b2 and \u03b3 (130-200 kd) (nomenclature according to Burgeson et al., Matrix Biol., 1994, 14:209-211). Laminins exist as several isoforms each having a unique combination of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 chains. Thus far, ten genetically distinct laminin chains, \u03b11-\u03b15, \u03b21-\u03b23 and \u03b31-\u03b32 are known. </p> In the laminin molecule the three chains are associated through a carboxyl terminal coiled coil (long arm), most of the chains having a free amino terminal short arm. Additionally, all the a chains have a large globular G domain at the carboxyl terminus. Laminin can contribute to the structural framework of the basement membrane, but it is also believed to have a role in cell differentiation, proliferation, adhesion and migration (Timpl, R. &amp; Brown, J. C. (1994) Matrix Biol. 14: 275-81, Yurchenco, P. D. &amp; O'Rear, J. J. (1994) Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 6: 674-81). Many of the laminin chains have tissue- and cell-specific distribution which may vary between different developmental stages, indicating specific functions for the various chains and isoforms. Evidence for tissue-specific roles of some of the laminin chains has come from identification of mutations in the \u03b12 chain gene in muscular dystrophies in mouse and man (Xu, H., Wu, X. R., Wewer, U. M. &amp; Engvall, E. (1994) Nature Genet. 8: 297-301; Heibling-Leclerc, A., Zhang, X., Topaloglu, H., Cruaud, C., Tesson, F., Weissenbach, J., Tome', F., Schwartz, K., Fardeau, M., Tryggvason, K. &amp; Guicheney, P. (1995) Nature Genet. 11: 216-218; Nissinen, M., Heiblin"
