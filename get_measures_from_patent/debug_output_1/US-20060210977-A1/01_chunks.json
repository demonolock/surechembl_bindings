    "uce the required DNA-binding domains for both Ga14 and LexA. Double Ga14-LexA DNA binding domain fusions, and modified pGDV1 target plasmids that contain recognition sequences for the Ga14 and LexA DNA binding domains are constructed using this same technique. The separate plasmids are then cut with restriction enzymes and ligated forming the complete construct as shown in FIG. 8. </p> Interplasmid transposition assays are performed using the DNA binding domain-transposase helpers, modified donor transposons and modified pGDV1 target plasmids to determine a) a general increase in transposition frequency and b) a specific targeting of transposon integration at or near the recognition sequences. </p> Genetic transformation experiments are performed in Drosophila melanogaster strains that contain Ga14 or LexA recognition sequences, using the modified helper and donor transposons to determine a) a general increase in germ-line transformation frequency and b) a specific targeting of integrations to the genomic copies of the recognition sequences. </p>5. Example 5 Chimeric Transposases  a) Plasmids. </p> PCR fragments of the ORFs encoding the transposase proteins of Tc1, Tc3, Himar1, and Mos1 were cloned into the Klenow-treated, 3.8-kb NotI fragment of pCMV\u03b2 (CLONTECH), resulting in, respectively, pRP1341, pRP1342, pRP1389, and pRP1353. </p> PCR fragments of the ORFs encoding the chimeric transposase proteins of Tc1, Tc3, Himar1, and Mos1, fused to the DNA binding domain of the 66 kD ALU-DNA repeat binding domain (Luk'yanov, et al. (1999) Biochemistry (Moscow) 64:25-33), the DNA binding domains from two proteins of 120 kDa and 35 kDa isolated from the HeLa cell proteins that specificaly bind to the Alu-element (Chiang Y and Vishwanatha J K (1996) Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry 155:131-138, 1996), or others contained herein and designed by methods provided by Kim, J S, et al. (Patent Application No. 20020061512) at the C-terminal domain of the transpoase, were cloned into the Klenow-treated, 3.8-kb NotI fragment of pCMV\u03b2 (CLONTECH), resulting in, respectively, pRP1341*, pRP1342*, pRP1389*, and pRP1353* plasmid groups. The template plasmids were, respectively, pRP470 (Vos J, et al (1993) Genes Development 7,:1244-1253), pRP716 (Van Luenen, HGAM et al (1993) EMBO J.12:2513-2520), pMar27fH (Lampe D J, et al (1999) PNAS 96:11428-11433), and pMos1 (Medhora M, et al (1991) Genetics 128:311-318). The mutations in the Tc3, Mos1, and Himar1 chimeric transposase ORFs are introduced either by site-directed mutagenesis using mutagenic primers or by a PCR-ligation-PCR method (Ali SA BioTechniques 18:746-750). The following cytomegalovirus (CMV) expression vectors are constructed: pRP2301* (Tc3 N225D/DBD), pRP2302* (Tc3 V41EN225D/DBD), pRP1390* (Mos1 F344L/DBD),pRP1398* (Himar1 H267R/DBD), pRP1399* (Himar1 Q131RE137K/DBD), and pRP2300* (Himar1 Q131R E137K H267R/DBD) plasmid groups. Also, the plasmids which contain site-directed mutagenesis to the transposases of"
