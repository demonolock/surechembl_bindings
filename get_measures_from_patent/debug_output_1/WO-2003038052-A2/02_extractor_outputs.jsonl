{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe K<sub>a</sub> determined for a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous in their affinities for multiple NAAP epitopes, represents the average affinity, or avidity, of the antibodies for NAAP, with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> L/mole.\nHigh-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> L/mole are prefe\u03c0ed for use in immunoassays in which the NAAP- antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations.\nLow-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> L/mole are preferred for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of NAAP, preferably in active form, from the antibody."}
