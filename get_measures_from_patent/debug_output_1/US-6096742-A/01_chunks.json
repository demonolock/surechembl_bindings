This activity may be demonstrated by the following assay.</p>A. Receptor Expression in COS</p>To express the cloned human neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) transiently in COS, the cDNA for the human NK1R was cloned into the expression vector pCDM9 which was derived from pCDM8 (INVITROGEN) by inserting the ampicillin resistance gene (nucleotide 1973 to 2964 from BLUESCRIPT SK+) into the Sac II site. Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into 10 million COS cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer (135 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM K<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.6 mM KH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) at 260 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (IBI, New Haven, Conn.). The cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 90% DMEM media (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00b0 C. for three days before the binding assay.</p>B. Stable Expression in CHO</p>To establish a stable cell line expressing the cloned human NK1R, the cDNA was subcloned into the vector pRcCMV (INVITROGEN). Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into CHO cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer suplemented with 0.625 mg/ml Herring sperm DNA at 300 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (IBI). The transfected cells were incubated in CHO media [10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml pennicilin-streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1/500 hypoxanthine-thymidine (ATCC), 90% IMDM media (JRH BIOSCIENCES, Lenexa, Kans.), 0.7 mg/ml G418 (GIBCO)] in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00b0 C. until colonies were visible. Each colony was separated and propagated. The cell clone with the highest number of human NK1R was selected for subsequent applications such as drug screening.</p>C. Assay Protocol using COS or CHO</p>The binding assay of human NK1R expressed in either COS or CHO cells is based on the use of <sup>125</sup> I-substance P (<sup>125</sup> I-Sp, from DU PONT, Boston, Mass.) as a radioactively labeled ligand which competes with unlabeled substance P or any other ligand for binding to the human NK1R. Monolayer cell cultures of COS or CHO were dissociated by the non-enzymatic solution (SPECIALTY MEDIA, Lavallette, N.J.) and resuspended in appropriate volume of the binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 0.04 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.004 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.01 mM phosphoramidon) such that 200 ul of the cell suspension would give rise to about 10,000 cpm of specific <sup>125</sup> I-SP binding (approximately 50,000 to 200,000 cells). In the binding assay, 200 ul of cells were added to a tube containing 20 ul of 1.5 to 2.5 nM of <sup>125</sup> I-SP and 20 ul of unlabeled substance P or any other test compound. The tubes were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. or at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking. The bound radioactivity was separated from unbound radioactivity by GF/C filter (BRANDEL, Gaithersburg, Md.) which was pre-wetted with 0.1% polyethylenimine. The filter was washed with 3 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl) three times and its radioactivity was determined by gamma counter.</p>The activation of phospholipase C by NK1R may also be measured in CHO cells expressing the human NK1R by determining the accumulation of inositol monophosphate which is a degradation product of IP<sub>3</sub>. CHO cells are seeded in 12-well plate at 250,000 cells per well. After incubating in CHO media for 4 days, cells are loaded with 0.025 uCi/ml of <sup>3</sup> H-myoinositol by overnight incubation. The extracellular radioactivity is removed by washing with phosphate buffered saline. LiCl is added to the well at final concentration of 0.1 mM with or without the test compound, and incubation is continued at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 min. Substance P is added to the well at final concentration of 0.3 nM to activate the human NK1R. After 30 min of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the media is removed and 0.1 N HCl is added. Each well is sonicated at 4\u00b0 C. and extracted with CHCl<sub>3</sub> /methanol (1:1). The aqueo"
