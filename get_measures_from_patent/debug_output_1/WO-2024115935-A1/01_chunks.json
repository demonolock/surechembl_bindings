    "4 and FR4-IMGT: 118 to 128) and of the complementarity determining regions: CDR1-IMGT: 27 to 38, CDR2-IMGT: 56 to 65 and CDR3-IMGT: 105 to 117. If the CDR3-IMGT length is less than 13 amino acids, gaps are created from the top of the loop, in the following order 111, 112, 110, 113, 109, 114, etc. If the CDR3-IMGT length is more than 13 amino acids, additional positions are created between positions 111 and 112 at the top of the CDR3-IMGT loop in the following order 112.1,111.1, 112.2, 111.2, 112.3, 111.3, etc. (http://www.imgt.org/IMGTScientificChart/Nomenclature/IMGT-FRCDRdefinition.html). As used herein, the term \u201cspecificity\u201d refers to the ability of an antibody to detectably bind an epitope presented on an antigen, such as CD39, while having relatively little detectable reactivity with non-CD39 proteins or structures (such as other proteins presented on B-cell lymphoma cells). Specificity can be relatively determined by binding or competitive binding assays, using, e.g., Biacore instruments, as described elsewhere herein. Specificity can be exhibited by, e.g., an about 10:1, about 20:1, about 50:1, about 100:1, 10.000:1 or greater ratio of affinity/avidity in binding to the specific antigen versus nonspecific binding to other irrelevant molecules (in this case the specific antigen is a CD39 polypeptide). \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"9\"/>-->\n The term affinity , as used herein, means the strength of the binding of an antibody to an epitope. The affinity of an antibody is given by the dissociation constant Kd, defined as [Ab] x [Ag] / [Ab-Ag], where [Ab-Ag] is the molar concentration of the antibody-antigen complex, [Ab] is the molar concentration of the unbound antibody and [Ag] is the molar concentration of the unbound antigen. The affinity constant Ka is defined by 1/Kd. Preferred methods for determining the affinity of mAbs can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988), Coligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1992, 1993), and Muller, Meth. Enzymol. 92:589-601 (1983), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference. One preferred and standard method well known in the art for determining the affinity of mAbs is the use of Biacore instruments. In natural antibodies, two heavy chains are linked to each other by disulfide bonds and each heavy chain is linked to a light chain by a disulfide bond. There are two types of light chain, lambda (l) and kappa (k). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. Each chain contains distinct sequence domains. The light chain includes two domains, a variable domain (VL) and a constant domain (CL). The heavy chain includes four domains, a variable domain (VH) and three constant domains (CH1, CH2 and CH3, collectively referred to as CH). The variable regions of both light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains determine binding recognition and specificity to the antigen. The constant region domains of the light (CL) and heavy (CH) chains confer important biological properties such as antibody chain association, secretion, trans-placental mobility, c"
