    "that are generated by differential splicing of the primary RNA transcript. cDNAs that are splice variants of the same gene will contain regions of sequence identity or complete homology (representing the presence of the same exon or portion of the same exon on both cDNAs) and regions of complete non-identity (for example, representing the presence of exon \u201cA\u201d on cDNA 1 wherein cDNA 2 contains exon \u201cB\u201d instead). Because the two cDNAs contain regions of sequence identity they will both hybridize to a probe derived from the entire gene or portions of the gene containing sequences found on both cDNAs; the two splice variants are therefore substantially homologous to such a probe and to each other.</p>When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d refers to any probe that can hybridize (i.e., it is the complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above.</p>As used herein, the term \u201ccompetes for binding\u201d is used in reference to a first polypeptide with an activity which binds to the same substrate as does a second polypeptide with an activity, where the second polypeptide is a variant of the first polypeptide or a related or dissimilar polypeptide. The efficiency (e.g., kinetics or thermodynamics) of binding by the first polypeptide may be the same as or greater than or less than the efficiency substrate binding by the second polypeptide. For example, the equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for binding to the substrate may be different for the two polypeptides. The term \u201cK<sub>m</sub>\u201d as used herein refers to the Michaelis-Menton constant for an enzyme and is defined as the concentration of the specific substrate at which a given enzyme yields one-half its maximum velocity in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.</p>As used herein, the term \u201chybridization\u201d is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the T<sub>m </sub>of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cT<sub>m</sub>\u201d is used in reference to the \u201cmelting temperature.\u201d The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the T<sub>m </sub>of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the T<sub>m </sub>value may be calculated by the equation: T<sub>m</sub>=81.5+0.41(% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization [1985]).
