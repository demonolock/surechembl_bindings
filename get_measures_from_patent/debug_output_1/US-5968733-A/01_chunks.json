Mycobacterium smegmatis is a nonpathogenic bacillus which shares antigenic and adjuvant properties with BCG. Both are also reasonably easy to grow in culture.</p>Because both mycobacteria have excellent adjuvant activity for induction of cell-mediated immunity, stimulate long-term memory (immunity) and have a low mortality associated with their use, they are excellent candidates as recombinant vaccines. That is, they are excellent candidates for use as vehicles (vaccine vehicles) into which genetic material (DNA) of interest (DNA from a source other than the mycobacterium into which it is being introduced) can be inserted and subsequently expressed.</p>DNA of interest can be of any origin and is: 1) DNA which is all or a portion of a gene or genes encoding protein(s) or polypeptide(s) of interest; 2) DNA encoding a selectable marker or markers; or 3) DNA encoding both a selectable marker (or selectable markers) at least one protein or polypeptide of interest. The term polypeptide of interest, used herein, includes all or a portion of a protein to be expressed. Such DNA of interest is expressed in the genetically recombinant mycobacteria, in which it ",
    "st. These temperate shuttle phasmids form turbid plaques on M. smegmatis and, upon lysogenization, confer resistance to superinfection and integrate within the mycobacterial chromosome. When an L1-shuttle phasmid containing a cloned gene conferring kanamycin-resistance in E. coli was introduced into M. smegmatis, stable kanamycin-resistant colonies (i.e., lysogens) were obtained.</p>Alternatively, a plasmid vector can be used to introduce DNA of interest into mycobacteria, in which the DNA is expressed extrachromosomally. For example, the shuttle plasmid M. fortuitum::E. coli hybrid plasmids were constructed from mycobacterial and E. coli replicons which contain kanamycin- and chloramphenicol-resistance genes. When introduced into M. smegmatis or BCG by electroporation, these shuttle plasmids conferred stable kanamycin- and chloramphenicol-resistance upon transformants. Thus, the vectors have made it possible to develop a transfection system which permits introduction of recombinant DNA molecules into mycobacteria.</p>It is also possible to introduce DNA of interest and cause it to integrate into host chromosomes without a phage. For example, this can be accomplished by homologous recombination, site specific recombination or nonhomologous recombination (e.g., by means of a transposon, which results in random insertion into host chromosomal material). Homologous recombination has been used, as described below, to integrate DNA of interest (e.g., kanamycin-resistance gene, 65 KD M. leprae gene).</p>In order to successfully introduce DNA of interest into a mycobacterium or into the mycobacterial genome by means of the shuttle vector or plasmid vector of the present invention or by homologous recombination, the following general approaches were followed. Although it is described in terms of M. smegmatis and M. bovis-BCG, it is to be understood that it can also be used to introduce DNA of interest into other mycobacteria and that these other genetically recombinant mycobacteria can also be expression or vaccine vehicles. Such other mycobacteria include: M. smegmatis, M. bovis-BCG, M. avium, M. phlei, M. fortuitum, M. lufu, M. paratuberculosis, M. habana, M. scrofulaceum, and M. intracellulare. In the case of slow growing mycobacteria (e.g., M. bovis-BCG and M. tuberculosis) to be used as vaccine vehicles, it is particularly valuable to go through (i.e., introduce DNA encoding an antigen or antigens of interest into) M. smegmatis and, subsequently, into M. bovis-BCG.</p>Development of a Shuttle Vector to Transfer DNA into MycobacteriaTransfection of Mycobacteriophage DNA into M. smegmatis</p>To develop a system that permits manipulation of DNA in mycobacteria, it was first necessary to develop an efficient means of transferring DNA into the bacillus. The technology used was a modification of that described by Okanishi and Hopwood in relation to the preparation of spheroplasts for Streptomyces. Streptomyces, like mycobacteria, are Actinomycetales. Okan",
    ". FIG. 8 outlines the construction of the pIJ666::pAL5000 library.</p>Transformation of this library into M. smegmatis spheroplasts has been difficult, possibly due to the problem of regenerating viable cells. DNA was therefore introduced directly into intact M. smegmatis cells by electroporation to obviate possible damage to mycobacterial cells which might result from use of protocols for producing spheroplasts. Conditions were developed for electroporation of lytic phage DNA that yielded more than 5\u00d710<sup>3</sup> pfu/ug. Electroporation of the pIJ666::pAL5000 library under these conditions into M. smegmatis yielded kanamycin- and chloramphenicol-resistance transformants. Plasmid DNA isolated from pools of M. smegmatis transformants in three separate experiments was transformed back into E. coli, selecting for kanamycin-resistance. Although pIJ666 was inserted at different sites within the pAL5000 genome in many of the isolated E. coli transformants, all plasmids were stable in both species (FIG. 9). These methods have made it possible to transform some BCG vaccine strains with the pIJ666::pAL5000 recombinant library, with expression of kanamycin-resistance, as described in Example 9 and shown in FIG. 10. Panel A of FIG. 10 shows kanamycin-resistant BCG colonies which arose after electroporation of BCG cells with shuttle plasmid DNA; panel B shows kanamycin-resistant BCG colonies that arose after electroporation without shuttle plasmid DNA. Using a similar approach, the 65 kD M. leprae gene has been introduced into BCG, in which it was expressed, as shown by results presented in FIG. 17.</p>Plasmid Vector for Integration of DNA of Interest into Mycobacterial Genomic DNA</p>A plasmid vector, which has been used to integrate DNA of nonmycobacterial origin (i.e., from a source other than the mycobacteria into which it was integrated) in mycobacterial genomic DNA, was constructed as represented in FIG. 11. Isolation of the M. bovis-BCG PyrF gene was carried out as follows and as described in Example 10. M. bovis-BCG DNA was partially digested with a restriction enzyme Sau3A, size selected and inserted into the vector pUC19. The resulting library was used to transform E. coli cells which had an insertion in the E. coli PyrF gene. Four independent colonies which had acquired the ability to grow in the absence of uracil were identified and plasmid DNA was isolated from them. This plasmid DNA was used to construct the recombinant plasmid vector. The PyrF gene of M. smegmatis was incorporated into the pUC19 plasmid vector at the BamHI site and the kanamycin resistance gene (Kan) was inserted into the PyrF gene at the BamHI site, using known techniques. PyrF<sup>+</sup>  cells are able to grow in medium without uracil and are fluoro-orotic acid sensitive (FOA<sup>S</sup>); PyrF<sup>-</sup>  cells need uracil for growth and are fluoro-orotic acid resistant (FOA<sup>R</sup>). Cells containing the kanamycin resistance gene are kamanycin resistant (KAN<sup>R",
    "/p>Thus, the Kan gene was stably integrated into the mycobacterial genome, using homologous recombination of adjacent PyrF sequences. An important advantage of the method of the present invention, which is illustrated in FIG. 12B, is that integration of the DNA of interest occurs without concomitant integration of plasmid or phage DNA into the genome. That is, the net effect is that the plasmid sequences are not present in the recombinant mycobacterial cells. Expression of the Kan gene was also demonstrated and cells in which both integration and resolution had occurred selected for on the basis of cell phenotype (in this case, KAN<sup>R</sup>, FOA<sup>R</sup>) In the work described above, DNA of nonmycobacterial origin (i.e., kanamycin resistance gene) was successfully introduced and stably integrated into M. smegmatis genomic DNA. The same techniques can be used to introduce DNA of nonmycobacterial origin into M. bovis-BCG or other mycobacterial genomic DNA.</p>Stable Integration of DNA Encoding an Antigen or Antigens into Mycobacterial Genomic DNAIntegration of an Interrupted PyrF Gene</p>In a similar manner, DNA encoding one or more antigens against which an immune response is desired can be integrated into mycobacterial genomic DNA. The method of the present invention, by which DNA of interest is integrated into mycobacterial genomic DNA, is represented schematically in FIG. 13. The method will be described with particular reference to integration of DNA which is the 65 KD M. leprae gene into M. smegmatis, which has been carried out (see Example 11). It is to be understood, however, that the same approach can be used to introduce the M. leprae 65 KD gene into other mycobacteria, as well as to integrate DNA encoding other polypeptides or proteins against which an immune response is sought into M. bovis-BCG, M. smegmatis or other mycobacteria.</p>Integration of DNA encoding a selected antigen (designated Fan, for foreign antigen) is represented in FIG. 13. An appropriate plasmid vector (e.g., one which can replicate in E. coli but not in mycobacteria), such as the recombinant pUC19 plasmid represented in FIG. 13, is used. The recombinant plasmid includes a mycobacterial gene or DNA sequences such as the PyrF gene represented in FIG. 13; sequences in this gene, which are homologous to those in the mycobacterial genome, provide the basis for homologous recombination between plasmid-borne mycobacterial sequences and genomic mycobacterial sequences to occur. The recombinant plasmid also includes DNA sequences necessary for replication and selection in E. coli and DNA sequences necessary for selection in mycobacteria. The sequences for use in selection confer a distinctive phenotype on the cell, thus making it possible to identify and isolate cells containing the gene. The gene can encode, for example, drug resistance. In FIG. 13, the recombinant plasmid includes a gene conferring kanamycin resistance, thus making it possible to select mycobacteria containing the gene simply by culturing on kanamycin-containing medium. The recombinant plasmid also contains DNA encoding one or more polypeptide or protein against which an immune response is desired (designated Fan), which is integrated into mycobacterial genomic DNA.</p>In one embodiment of the present invention, the 65 KD gene of M. leprae has been integrated into M. smegmatis genomic DNA through use of a recombinant plasmid as represented in FIG. 13, in which Fan is the M. leprae gene.</p>The recombinant plasmid (e.g., a plasmid containing the PyrF gene into which the 65 KD M. leprae gene and a Kan gene were inserted) was introduced into mycobacterial cells (M. smegmatis) using standard electroporation techniques. (See Example 11). Electroporated cells were then plated onto kanamycin-containing medium. Only kanamycin-resistant (KAN<sup>R</sup>) cells grew under these conditions; such cells had integrated into genomic DNA the KAN<sup>R</sup> gene and the M. leprae gene and were also FOA<sup>S</sup> (due to the disrupted PyrF genes from the recombinant plasmid and from the mycobacterium).</p>Cells were subsequently transferred to FOA-containing medium to identify those cells in which the Fan gene (here, the M. leprae gene) was stably integrated into genomic DNA. As indicated in the bottom panel of FIG. 13 (left side), integrated into genomic DNA of such cells (KAN<sup>R</sup>, FOA<sup>R</sup>) is the disrupted PyrF gene which contains the kanamycin resistance gene and the Fan gene. As indicated at the right side of the bottom panel, mycobacterial cells which have undergone looping out with the result that only a complete PyrF gene remains in the genome are both kanamycin sensitive and fluoro-orotic acid sensitive.</p>Thus, as described above and in Example 11, it has been possible to integrate into mycobacterial genomic DNA DNA encoding a protein antigen and to identify and select those cells which contain the stably integrated DNA of interest. In addition, such DNA of interest has been integrated into the mycobacterial genome at a selected sit",
    "creening additional L1::pHC79 recombinant phasmids, to determine the maximum amount of DNA that can be deleted from the L1 phage and to define additional non-essential regions of the phage genome into which DNA can be inserted.</p>Construction of Genetically Recombinant Mycobacteria Useful to Express DNA of Interest</p>The method of the present invention is useful to construct a genetically recombinant mycobacterial vehicle for the expression of the protein(s) or polypeptide(s) encoded by DNA of interest incorporated into the mycobacterium. Such genetically recombinant mycobacteria have many uses.</p>Vehicles of the present invention can be used, for example, as vaccines to induce immunity against the pathogenic antigen encoded by the DNA of interest. A pathogen is any virus, microorganism, or other organism or substance (e. g., toxins) which causes disease. A vaccine vehicle useful for immunizing against leprosy can be made. Because of the extraordinary adjuvant activity of mycobacteria, such as BCG, such a vaccine would be effective in producing cell-mediated immunity, particularly of a long-term or enduring nature. Genes encoding protein antigens of the leprosy parasite M. leprae have been isolated by Young and are described in detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 892,095, filed Jul. 31, 1986, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, genes encoding five immunogenic protein antigens (i. e., antigens of molecular weight 65 kD, 36 kD, 28 kD, 18 kD and 12 kD) have been isolated. In addition, 6 different epitopes encoded by the gene for the 65 kD antigen have been defined. At least one of these epitopes has been shown to be unique to M. leprae; the other epitopes have been shown to be shared with the 65 kD proteins of other mycobacteria.</p>Through use of the shuttle vectors and recombinant plasmid vectors of the present invention, it is possible to introduce into BCG one or more of the genes encoding M. leprae protein antigens, using methods described above and in the following examples. The gene encoding the 65 kD M. leprae protein has, in fact, been introduced into and expressed by recombinant BCG. Results of Western blot analysis (FIG. 17) demonstrated the presence of both the 65 kD M. leprae antigen and the selectable marker. For example, the gene encoding the 65 kD M. leprae antigen can be introduced into BCG, stably integrated into its genomic DNA and expressed at levels sufficient to stimulate or induce an immune response in a host to which it is administered. As described in detail in Example 11, monoclonal antibodies specific for the 65 kD M. leprae protein have been used to demonstrate expression of the 65 kD M. Ieprae gene in extracts of M. smegmatis into which the gene was introduced. In addition, the gene encoding the SIV1 envelope protein has been cloned into a similar plasmid vector, to be introduced into M. smegmatis using the techniques described for the Kan and M. leprae genes. A similar construct, for introduction into BCG, has also been made. In this way, it is possible to construct a vaccine which is close to ideal, in that it contains one or more protective antigens of M. leprae, does not have tolerogenic determinants and has an excellent adjuvant for inducing cell-mediated immunity.</p>In a similar fashion, it is possible to construct a vaccine, using a shuttle or plasmid vector and the method of the present invention, to provide specific protection against tuberculosis. Such a vaccine is particularly attractive because of the recently reported finding, described above, that presently-used vaccines are proving to be ineffective. Genes encoding immunogenic protein antigens of the tubercle bacillus M. tuberculosis have been isolated and are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/010,007, entitled \"Genes Encoding Protein Antigens of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and Uses Therefor\", by Robert N. Husson and Richard A. Young, filed Feb. 2, 1987 (now abandoned), and in the continuation-in-part application, Ser. No. 07/154,331, filed by the Express Mail procedure Feb. 10, 1988), entitled \"Genes Encoding Protein Antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Uses Therefor\", by Robert N. Husson, Richard A. Young and Thomas M. Shinnick, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>In this case, a gene encoding an immunogenic protein antigen of M. tuberculosis is introduced into BCG by means of a shuttle or plasmid vector, as described above. It is also possible to introduce more than one M. tuberculosis gene, each encoding a protein antigen, into BCG. For example, a gene encoding immunogenic M. tuberculosis antigens of molecular weight 12 kD, 14 kD, 19 kD, 65 kD and 71 kD, or a combination of two or more of these genes, can be inserted into BCG, stably integrated into genomic DNA and expressed. The result is a vaccine which is specific for immunization against tuberculosis and which induces long-lived immunity against the bacillus.</p>It is also possible, using the method of the present invention, to construct a multipurpose or multifunctional vaccine (i. e., a single vaccine vehicle which contains and expresses DNA of interest which includes more than one gene, each gene encoding a protein antigen for a different pathogen or toxin). For example, it is possible to introduce into BCG, using the shuttle vector phasmid or the plasmid vector described, a gene encoding a protein antigen for M. leprae, a gene encoding a protein antigen for M. tuberculosis, a gene encoding a protein antigen for Leishmania, and a gene encoding a protein antigen for malaria. Administration of this multi-valent vaccine would result in stimulation of an immune response to each antigen and provide long-term protection against leprosy, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and malaria.</p>The recombinant mycobacteria can also be used as an anti-fertility \"vaccine\" vehicle. For example, mycobacteria containing DNA encoding antigens such as human gonadotropic hormone (HGH) fragments can be used as an anti-fertility vaccine and administered as a birth control agent. Vaccine vehicles of the present invention can be used to treat human cancers, such as bladder cancers or melanomas (e",
    "ml ampicillin. The proportion of colonies containing recombinant plasmids was determined by plating onto indicator plates containing XGal and IPTG and determining the ratio of white colonies to total (white plus blue) colonies. Pooled plasmid DNA was obtained by scraping colonies from the plates, resuspending in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM glucose. The resulting suspension was processed by the alkaline lysis method for obtaining plasmid DNA. The M. smegmatis recombinant DNA library consists of 35,000 independent initial transformants, of which 85% were recombinant. The M. bovis-BCG recombinant DNA library consists of 64,000 independent initial transformants of which 55% were recombinant.</p>Isolation of Recombinant Plasmids Containing the Mycobacterial pyrF Gene</p>Y1103 and Y1107 were made competent by the method of Hanahan, transformed with the plasmid library DNA and plated on minimal agar plates. Of 180,000 transformants initially screened for the M. smegmatis library, 31 were able to grow on minimal medium.</p>Plasmid DNA Isolation, Restriction Mapping and DNA Sequencing</p>Plasmid DNA was isolated from liquid cultures by the alkaline lysis method. Restriction mapping of recombinant plasmid DNA was performed with multiple enzymes using standard methods. DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy method after subcloning into M13mp18 and M13mp19, using sequencing kits from New England Biolabs and U.S. Biochemicals.</p>EXAMPLE 11Integration of the M. leprae 65 KD Gene into M. smegmatis Genomic DNAConstruction of Recombinant Plasmids Expressing Kanamycin Resistance and the M. leprae 65 kD Antigen</p>pPP25, a recombinant plasmid containing DNA from M. smegmatis able to complement pyrF<sup>-</sup> E. coli, was digested with BamHI and ligated to the 1.3 kB BamHI fragment encoding aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of Tn903, isolated from pUC4kSAC. The Eco RI fragment of Y3178 containing the gene encoding the M. leprae 65 kD antigen as subsequently cloned into the unique XhoI and EcoRV sites in the mycobacterial DNA in this plasmid. In each case the transcriptional orientations of the mycobacterial open reading frame, the kanamycin resistance gene and the M. leprae 65 kD gene were determined to be in the same orientation.</p>Transformation of Mycobacteria by Electroporation</p>M. smegmatis and M. bovis-BCG were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with ADC enrichment and 0.05% Tween 80 (M-ADC-Tw) to an A<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.3 to 0.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 10 mM Hepes pH7.0, centrifuged and resuspended in 1/10 volume 10 mM Hepes pH7.0, 10% glycerol (M. smegmatis), or washed and resuspended in 1/10 volume 7 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 272 mM sucrose (BCG). DNA was added and the cells were exposed to a single pulse of 6.25 kV/cm at 25 microfarads using the Biorad Gene Pulser. Three to five volumes of M-ADC-Tw were then added, the cells were incubated for 2-3 hours at 37\u00b0 C., centrifuged, resuspended in a small volume of M-ADC-Tw and plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 1% glucose, containing 10 ug/ml kanamycin (M. smegmatis) or Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with ADC enrichment containing 10 ug/ml kanamycin.</p>Southern Blot Analysis</p>Genomic DNA from mycobacterial transformants was digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed in agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with DNA labelled with <sup>32</sup> P by nick translation, all using standard procedures.</p>Western Blot (Immunoblot) Analysis</p>Expression of the 65 kD M. leprae protein was demonstrated using Western blot techniques. Lysates of mycobacterial and E. coli transformants were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electro-transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the monoclonal antibody IIIE9 at a dilution of approximately 1:1000 using standard techniques. The Protoblot kit (Promega Biotec) was used to detect binding of the antibody and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. This resulted in detection of expression of the 65 kD protein in cells transformed with the plasmid containing the M. leprae gene.</p>Equivalents</p>Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described specifically herein.
