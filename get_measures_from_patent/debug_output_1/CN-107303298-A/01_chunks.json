    "tment to AMPK activation.</p>At present according to AMPK activation mechanism, AMPK activators can be divided into direct agonist and indirect activator again,\nAMPK direct agonists directly act on AMPK subunits, such as AMP, ADP, ATP and its analogue\uff1bAnd the indirect activators of AMPK\nThen by kinases LKB1, the CaMKK \u03b2 and Tak1 of upstream, or by raising AMP/ATP ratio activate AMPK.</p>In May, 2014, Boehringer Ingelheim (Boehringer Ingelheim) is announced, with biotech company of India\nConnexios Life Sciences endorsed an exclusive global development cooperation agreement, develop for treating diabetes B\nAMPK activators.CNX-012-570(\u300aCNX-012-570,a direct AMPK activator provides strong\nglycemic and lipid control along with significant reduction in body weight\uff1b\nstudies from both diet-induced obese mice and db/db mice models\u300b,\n\u300aCardiovascular Diabetology\u300b13rd phase, in January, 2014) it is from Connexios companies AMPK activators\nGuide's drug candidate in mesh, can directly activate the specific isomers of AMPK albumen, and in preclinical study, the medicine has been showed\nGo out the beneficial outcomes to liver, muscle, fat and other linked groups' Targeted-controls.Merk companies apply in 2012-2014\nMulti-section patent is used to protect the sugared cycle compound of Azabenzimidazole-based polyhydroxy base class, can be used for treating II as AMPK activator\nThe diseases such as patients with type \u2160 DM, obesity, high fat of blood, hypertension, such compound reaches 1- to the EC50 of recombination human source AMPK compounds 7\n7nM.Compound AdipoRon is the indirect activators of AMPK, AMPK is activated by acting on adiponectin receptors, so as to improve grape\nSugar tolerance and insulin resistance.The influence of marketed drug melbine, Rosiglitazone, jamaicin to organism metabolism also partly passes through\nAMPK approach works.</p>Jamaicin (Berberine) is the chief active alkaloid in the traditional Chinese medicine coptis, and the coptis is used as traditional Chinese medicine\nIt can be traced back to before 500 years Christian eras in treatment \" diabetes \" (diabetes), so far the existing history of 2000.In addition, barberry\nAlkali also has the physiological function of other very abundants, such as antibacterial, antimalarial, anticancer, anti-cardiovascular disease isoreactivity.It is small in the U.S.\nBark of a cork tree alkali can improve medicine as diabetes in Chinese jamaicin and be widely used, clinical dosage scheme is as nutriment\uff1a\n500mg~1.5g, takes once a day, or 300mg daily three times, is better than it has been reported that jamaicin improves glycemic control\nMelbine, because jamaicin can also reduce low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol.Can be with the treatment of fat cell Berberine\nIndependent of LKB1, CaMKK beta kinase of upstream, and AMPK is activated by the ratio for changing AMP/ATP.Mechanism of action shows\uff1aBarberry\nAlkali may act on mitochondrial complex I, suppress mitochondrial breathing, change AMP/ATP ratios to ac"
