    "ng administered; the route of administration; and the nature of the disease, disorder, condition or symptom thereof. The dosing regimen can also take into consideration the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse effects associated with the agent(s) being administered. Effective dosage amounts and dosage regimens can readily be determined from, for example, safety and dose-escalation trials, in vivo studies (e.g., animal models), and other methods known to the skilled artisan.</p>As discussed elsewhere herein, the present disclosure contemplates embodiments of the PEG-IL-10 and IL-12 agent combination therapy wherein a PEG-IL-10 is administered in an amount and frequency such that a desired serum trough concentration (e.g., \u226510 ng/mL) is maintained. Embodiments of the of the PEG-IL-10 and IL-12 agent combination therapy are also contemplated wherein an IL-12 agent is dosed such that the serum concentration achieves a peak and is then cleared to an unmeasurable level before it is administered again.</p>In general, dosing parameters dictate that the dosage amount be less than an amount that could be irreversibly toxic to the subject (i.e., the maximum tolerated dose, \u201cMTD\u201d) and not less than an amount required to produce a measurable effect on the subject. Such amounts are determined by, for example, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters associated with ADME, taking into consideration the route of administration and other factors.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cEC50\u201d and the phrase \u201chalf maximal effective concentration\u201d have their generally accepted meaning; that is, the EC50 is the concentration of a therapeutic agent (e.g., a PEG-IL-10) which induces a response halfway between the baseline and the maximum after some specified exposure time. The skilled artisan is familiar with means for determining the EC50 of a therapeutic agent. For example, the EC50 may be determined using commercially available software (e.g., Graphpad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, Calif.) after measuring certain concentration-related parameters of the therapeutic agent in a cell-based assay.</p>An effective dose (ED) is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in some fraction of the subjects taking it. The \u201cmedian effective dose\u201d or ED50 of an agent is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50% of the population to which it is administered. Although the ED50 is commonly used as a measure of reasonable expectance of an agent's effect, it is not necessarily the dose that a clinician might deem appropriate taking into consideration all relevant factors. Thus, in some situations the effective amount can be more than the calculated ED50, in other situations the effective amount can be less than the calculated ED50, and in still other situations the effective amount can be the same as the calculated ED50.</p>In addition, an effective dose of a PEG-IL-10 and an IL-12 agent of the present disclosure can be an amount that, when administered in one or more doses to a subject, produces a desired result relative to a healthy subject. For example, for a subject experiencing a particular disorder, an effective dose can be one that improves a diagnostic parameter, measure, marker and the like of that disorder by at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, a"
