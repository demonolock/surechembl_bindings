Among aryliodonium salt-based compounds, a particularly preferred example of the photoacid generator (C3) according to the present invention is an aryiodonium salt that produces, by a cleavage reaction, an acid having an acid dissociation constant in water at 25\u2032C of \u22123.0 or higher. From an aryliodonium salt, an acid (HX) is generated as represented by the following Formula (1) by a cleavage reaction by light irradiation.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20200069534A1-20200305-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/682740929/US/20200305/A1/020200/06/95/34/US20200069534A1-20200305-C00001.TIF\"/></p>In Formula (1), R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group.

For example, in Patent Document 7, an Example of using a diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate that generates an acid having high acidity is described. On the other hand, in a case of using an aryliodonium salt that generates an acid having high acidity, when an amine compound, particularly a tertiary amine compound, is present in the polymerization initiator, since the acid is likely to cause a polymerization reaction with the tertiary amine compound and produce a salt, it is considered that the polymerization activity may be damaged.
