    "ing at least type II diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis and heart disease. In view of the prior art knowledge, this is a very difficult task, since osmotin or osmotin-like proteins represent a very small fraction of the total protein content in plants and separation of osmotin or osmotin-like proteins from large amounts of protein impurities may to date only be achieved by means of a method based on narasimohan et al (1987) or an improvement thereof involving several steps: ammonium sulfate precipitation or centrifugation or both at 10,000g followed by gradient elution on carboxymethyl dextran (CM Sephadex) or SCX-polyamide HPLC; furthermore, a slight thin yield of 400. mu.g of 95% pure antifungal protein or 200. mu.g of 99% pure antifungal protein was also obtained from 400g of leaf material. However, in order to put it into practical use for therapeutic applications, the demand for osmotin production far exceeds the current 200-400 \u03bc g levels.</p>Savingikar &amp; savingikar (2014) (WO2014/195975) discloses a method for combating pathogenic effects using a plant juice soluble plant protein comprising heat-stabilizing; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this specification. The composition is normalized with respect to a parameter of the properties of the composition, which parameter is related to the anti-pathogenic properties or to the content of protein molecules having a molecular weight of 26 Kilodaltons (KD) or less. Also disclosed is an anti-pathogenic composition comprising a heat-stable plant juice soluble plant protein, wherein the heat-stable plant juice soluble plant protein is obtained as a juice soluble by heat-treating a plant or plant juice to precipitate the protein, a substantial amount of which is heat-coagulable together with a group of phytochemicals co-coagulated with the heat-precipitable protein in the plant, leaving other plant components in the juice which carry a minor amount of the heat-stable juice soluble protein, to produce a juice soluble, and wherein the composition is standardized for a parameter of a property of the composition which is related to the anti-pathogenic property or to the content of protein molecules having a molecular weight of 26 Kilodaltons (KD) or less. Also disclosed is a method/process for preparing a composition comprising a thermostable plant juice soluble plant protein, the process comprising the steps of: (a) heating the precipitated plant juice and separating macromolecules including proteins which coagulate upon heating from the soluble components to obtain juice solubles containing heat stable plant juice soluble plant proteins, (b) quantifying the heat stable plant juice soluble plant proteins by a method related to the content of anti-pathogenic properties or protein molecules having a molecular weight of 26 kilodaltons or less, (c) concentrating or diluting to a number (figure) of parameters determined/selected as a standard for the properties, and, further optionally adding an additive component selected from the group comprising: pharmaceutically active substances, pharmaceutical excipients, cosmeceutical active substances, cosmeceutical excipients, nutraceutical active substances, nutraceutical excipients, plant protection active substances, food additives or other food ingredients. Also disclosed is a plant material composition free of heat stable proteins; wherein the composition is prepared by: pulping the plant material, removing juice from the solid residue, heating the juice to remove coagulable proteins and non-proteinaceous matter as coagulum, removing coagulum, followed by removing heat stable proteins from the resulting composition, optionally treating the resulting composition to obtain",
