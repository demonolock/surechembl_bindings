(FIG. 5A) Yeast-displayed DR-IL-18 variants hCS1-hCS4 and A8 are capable of binding hIL-18R\u03b1 with comparable binding isotherms as WT human IL-18 (left). By contrast, very little binding is observed with the same variants and hIL-18BP (right). (FIG. 5B) Representative surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams between immobilized biotinylated hIL-18BP and the DR-IL-18 variants. Recombinant hIL-18 (left) binds IL-18BP with exquisitely high affinity, K<sub>D</sub>=2.0 pM, whereas hCS1 (right) shows greatly attenuated binding, with a much faster off-rate and K<sub>D</sub>=15.2 nM. This data is summarized in Tables 6 and 7.</p>FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B depict results from example experiments, demonstrating human DR-IL-18 variants are not inhibited by IL-18BP. (FIG. 6A) Recombinant IL-18BP inhibits biotinylated IL-18R\u03b1 from binding yeast-displayed WT IL-18, but does not affect the DR-IL-18 variants hCS1-4 and A8 (left). By contrast, IL-18BP effectively neutralizes the IL-18 E42A, K89A and E42A/K89A previously described (Kim et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 98(6):3304-3309) (right) [E42 and K89 of Kim et al. are E6 and K53 of SEQ ID NO: 30, respectively]. Biotinylated IL-18R\u03b1 was kept at a fixed concentration of 100 nM for all samples. (FIG. 6B) WT IL-18 and hCS1, hCS3, and hCS4 stimulate IL-18 HEK-Blue\u2122 reporter cells with comparable potency and efficacy (left). Wild-type IL-18 is highly sensitive to application of recombinant IL-18BP in this assay (IC50=3 nM), whereas hCS1 and hCS3 are not inhibited by recombinant IL-18BP, even at IL-18BP concentrations of 1 \u03bcM (Right). hIL-18 was kept at a fixed concentration of 5 nM and hCS1 and hCS3 at 2.5 nM.</p>FIG. 7A through FIG. 7C depict results from example experiments demonstrating engineering additional human IL-18 variants for independence to IL-18BP (version 2 variants) using yeast display.

These cytokine variants were displayed on yeast and IL-18BP inhibition of IL-18R\u03b1 binding was assessed by flow cytometry. As seen in FIG. 6A, while the DR-hIL-18 variants were impervious to inhibition of hIL-18R\u03b1 binding by hIL-18BP, the Kim et al variants showed roughly equivalent hIL-18BP neutralization as compared to WT hIL-18. These results indicate that the DR-hIL-18 variants are IL-18BP independent, whereas the Kim et al variants are highly sensitive to IL-18BP inhibition, similar to WT hIL-18.</p>To confirm that the DR-hIL-18 could yield productive signaling through the IL-18 receptor in a cellular context, concentration-response experiments were performed using the HEK-Blue\u2122 IL-18 reporter cell line. In this system, IL-18R signaling is read-out by expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) downstream of a NFxb/AP1 promotor. In the absence of IL-18BP, DR-hIL-18 variants yielded signaling EC50 values commensurate with WT hIL-18. However, the DR-hIL-18 variants demonstrated virtually no inhibition by hIL-18BP, with no detectable inhibition at 1 \u03bcM IL-18BP (FIG. 6B). Taken together, these studies establish that the DR-hIL-18 variants are biologically active and impervious to IL-18BP neutralization in a cell signaling context.</p>Engineering and Characterization of Second-Generation Human IL-18 Variants that are Resistant to IL-18BP Inhibition (Human v2.0 DR-IL-18 Variants)</p>To obtain additional, potentially enhanced human DR-IL-18 variants, a second library of human IL-18 randomized at 11 positions (FIG. 7A) was designed and yeast was transformed as described above. The resulting library of 6\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>transformants was selected as outlined in (FIG. 7B), yielding a robust preference for IL-18R\u03b1 compared to IL-18BP with successive selection steps (FIG. 7C). 17 unique sequences were recovered after 5-6 rounds of selection (FIG. 8). (FIG. 9A) Compared to WT IL-18, clones 6-12, 6-27, 6-29, and 6-31 had equal or somewhat stronger binding to IL18R\u03b1 as measured by yeast-binding isotherms with biotinylated IL18R\u03b1. (FIG. 9B) However, these clones did not show any appreciable binding to IL-18BP. (FIG. 9C) Measurement of thermal stability by applying a range of temperatures to the yeast-displayed clones showed that they were more thermal stable than WT IL-18 by 7-13\u00b0 C. These results are summarized in (FIG. 9D).</p>Engineering IL-18 Variants that are Resistant to IL-18BP Inhibition (Murine DR-IL-18 Variants)</p>As the human and mouse interspecies cross-reactivity of IL-18 for IL-18R\u03b1 is poor, murine equivalents of the DR-IL-18 variants that could be used for studies in mice were created. Similar to the approach taken for hIL-18 above, a combinatorial library of mIL-18 variants randomizing a similar set of mIL-18R\u03b1/mIL-18BP contact residues (Table 3) was created, yielding a library of 4\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>transformants. Directed evolution was performed on this library similar to how it was performed with the human IL-18 library; the selection strategy is summarized in FIG. 10A. After the completion of six rounds of selection, the remaining clones had a near-complete preference for mIL-18R\u03b1 over mIL-18BP (FIG. 10B). Analysis of 96 clones revealed 11 unique sequences, from which were derived two consensus sequences mCS1 and mCS2 (FIG. 10C). Yeast binding isotherms and surface plasmon resonance experiments confirmed these DR-IL-18 clones had an even greater independence for IL-18BP than the human IL-18 variants described herein, with the mIL-18BP binding KD's being well above 1 \u03bcM, with mIL-18R\u03b1\u02dcbinding remaining roughly equal to WI mIL-18 (FIG. 1A, FIG. 11B, Tables 8 and 9).</p>TABLE 8IL-18R\u03b1 and IL-18BP binding affinities ofmouse IL-18 variants by on-yeast binding isothermsDissociationK<sub>D </sub>ratio:Constant RatioIL-18K<sub>D </sub>IL-18R\u03b1K<sub>D </sub>IL-18BPIL-18BP/IL-normalized toVariant(M)(M)18R\u03b1WT IL-18mIL-18 WT1.13E\u2212082.13E\u221209\u20021.88E\u2212011mA71.35E\u221208NBD&gt;7.41E+02&gt;3.93E+03mB11.79E\u221208NBD&gt;5.59E+02&gt;2.96E+03mE84.20E\u221208NBD&gt;2.38E+02&gt;1.26E+03mC14.30E\u221208NBD&gt;2.33E+02&gt;1.23E+03mCS11.07E\u221208NBD&gt;9.35E+02&gt;4.96E+03mCS21.13E\u221208NBD&gt;8.85E+02&gt;4.69E+03NBD, no binding detected (10 \u03bcM used for ratio calculations)</p>TABLE 9IL-18R\u03b1 and IL-18BP binding affinitiesof mouse IL-18 variants by SPRDissociationK<sub>D </sub>ratio:Constant RatioIL-18K<sub>D </sub>IL-18R\u03b1K<sub>D </sub>IL-18BPIL-18BP/IL-normalized toVariant(M)(M)18R\u03b1WT IL-18mIL-18 WT6.00E\u2212101.10E\u2212121.83E\u2212031mA72.20E\u2212101.39E\u2212056.32E+043.45E+07mB17.00E\u2212101.47E\u2212052.10E+041.15E+07mE81.69E\u221209NBD&gt;1.78E+04\u2002&gt;9.68E+06\u2002mC11.09E\u2212092.87E\u2212052.63E+041.44E+07mCS15.40E\u2212103.80E\u2212067.04E+033.84E+06mCS27.90E\u2212111.05E\u2212051.33E+057.25E+07NBD, no binding detected (30 \u03bcM used for ratio calculations)</p>In Vivo Pharmacodynamic Studies of DR-IL-18 VariantsTo assess the biologic effects of administration of the DR-IL-18 variants in vivo, pharmacodynamics studies were performed in mice, comparing WI mIL-18 to mCS2.

    "t positions for IL-18R\u03b1 (FIG. 20A) and a yeast-displayed library was prepared as described previously for human and mouse DR-IL-18. The resulting library of 3.9\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>transformants was selected for 3 rounds as indicated in (FIG. 20B), selecting for retained IL-18BP binding, while counterselecting against IL-18R\u03b1. As seen in (FIG. 20C), each round of selection conferred enrichment for binding to IL-18BP (human and mouse), but without acquisition of IL-18R\u03b1 binding. 96 clones were sequenced, yielding 31 unique sequences, from which three consensus sequences hD2D-CS1, hD2D-CS2, and hD2D-CS3 were derived (FIG. 21). Biophysical characterization of the resulting clones indicated that they showed similar binding isotherms to IL-18BP as WT IL-18 (FIG. 22A), but with greatly decreased/absent binding to IL-18R\u03b1 (FIG. 22B). These data are summarized in (FIG. 22C). An identical selection process was performed for murine IL-18, creating a library of 2.0\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>transformants, which we selected to obtain 51 unique sequences (summarized in FIG. 23).</p>Example 2: Binding Affinity Measurements of Second Generation VariantsSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to perform biophysical affinity measurements of second generation DR-IL-18 variants (binding to IL-18R vs IL-18BP).
