    "he present invention relates to novel alkylacetylene substituted acyltryptophanols with FSH-receptor antagonist activity. The present invention also relates to a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds according to the invention, and the use thereof for fertility control in men or women, for the treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis.</p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are together responsible for the control of male and female fertility and of the production of sex steroids.</p>In the female mammal, FSH controls the early ripening of ovarian primary follicles and the biosynthesis of sex steroids. In the advanced stage of differentiation (preantral follicles), the influence of LH becomes increasingly important for further development of the follicles until ovulation occurs.</p>In male mammals, FSH is primarily responsible for the differentiation and stimulation of Sertoli cells. Their function consists of assisting spermatogenesis on many levels. LH is primarily responsible for stimulating the Leydig cells and thus androgen production. FSH, LH and TSH (thyrotropic hormone) together form the group of glycoprotein hormones which are formed in the pituitary and are secreted from there. Whereas the alpha subunit is common to the three hormones, their specificity of action is determined by the beta chain which is unique in each case. The molecular weight of FSH including the sugar portion is about 30 kD.</p>FSH and the other glycoprotein hormones act specifically via their selectively expressed G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). FSH stimulates, through binding to its receptor, the association thereof with a stimulating G protein (G<sub>s</sub>) which is thereby stimulated to hydrolyse guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and to activate the membrane-associated adenylate cyclase. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is accordingly an important and readily quantifiable secondary messenger substance of FSH (G. Vassart, L. Pardo, S. Costagliola, Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004, 29, 119-126).</p>The importance of FSH for male fertility is the subject of intensive research. It has been possible to show that FSH influences several processes of spermatogenesis such as the proliferation of spermatogonia, the antiapoptotic effect on spermatogonia and spermatocytes and the stimulation of sperm maturation including motility thereof.</p>The following arguments are also in favour of the FSH receptor as target for male fertility control:\n1. The FSH receptor is exclusively expressed on Sertoli cells (high specificity).2. Contraceptive vaccination against FSH beta chain or the FSH receptor induces infertility in male primates (N. R. Mougdal, M. Jeyakumar, H. N. Krishnamurthy, S. Sridhar, H. Krishnamurthy, F. Martin, Human Reproduction Update 1997, 3, 335-346).3. Naturally occurring mutations in the FSH receptor or the FSH beta chain may lead to sub- or infertility in men (I. Huhtaniemi, Journal of Rep"
