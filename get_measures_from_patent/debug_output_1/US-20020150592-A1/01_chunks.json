    "atography or other purification methodology and conventional formulation techniques. </p>[0039] For example, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the target pathogen is M. tuberculosis and the majorly abundant products released extracellularly by M. tuberculosis into broth culture are separated from other bacterial components and used to elicit an immune response in mammalian hosts. Individual proteins or groups of proteins are then utilized in animal based challenge experiments to identify those which induce protective immunity making them suitable for use as vaccines in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. More specifically, following the growth and harvesting of the bacteria, by virtue of their physical abundance the principal extracellular products are separated from intrabacterial and other components through centrifugation and filtration. If desired, the resultant bulk filtrate is then subjected to fractionation using ammonium sulfate precipitation with subsequent dialysis to give a mixture of extracellular products, commonly termed EP. Solubilized extracellular products in the dialyzed fractions are then purified to substantial homogeneity using suitable chromatographic techniques as known in the art and as described more fully below. </p>[0040] These exemplary procedures result in the production of fourteen individual proteinaceous major extracellular products of M. tuberculosis having molecular weights ranging from 110 kilo Daltons (KD) to 12 KD. Following purification each individual majorly abundant extracellular product exhibits one band corresponding to its respective molecular weight when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis thereby allowing individual products or groups of products corresponding to the majorly abundant extracellular products to be identified and prepared for use as vaccines in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The purified majorly abundant extracellular products may further be characterized and distinguished by determining all or part of their respective amino acid sequences using techniques common in the art. Sequencing may also provide information regarding possible structural relationships between the majorly abundant extracellular products. </p>[0041] Subsequently, immunization and the stimulation of acquired immunity in a mammalian host system may be accomplished through the teachings of the present invention utilizing a series of subcutaneous or intradermal injections of these purified extracellular products over a course of time. For example, injection with a purified majorly abundant bacterial extracellular product or products in incomplete Freund's adjuvant followed by a second injection in the same adjuvant approximately three weeks later can be used to elicit a protective response upon subsequent challenge with the virulent pathogen. Other exemplary immunization protocols within the scope and teachings of the present invention may include a series ",
    "compared with the animals immunized with the combination of the majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis. Moreover, half of the control animals died during the observation period while none of the immunized animals succumbed to tuberculosis. Autopsies conducted after this experiment revealed that the non-immunized control animals had significantly more colony forming units (CFU) and corresponding damage in their lungs and spleens than the protected animals. Seventeen additional combinations of purified majorly abundant extracellular products provided immunoprophylaxis when tested, thereby demonstrating the scope of the present invention and broad range of vaccines which may be formulated in accordance with the teachings thereof. </p>[0043] However, it should be emphasized that the present invention is not restricted to combinations of secretory or extracellular products. For example, several alternative experimental protocols demonstrate the capacity of a single abundant extracellular product to induce mammalian protective immunity in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In each experiment guinea pigs were immunized with a single majorly abundant extracellular product purified from M. tuberculosis EP using the chromatography protocols detailed herein. In one example the animals were vaccinated in multiple experiments with an adjuvant composition containing a purified abundant secretory product having a molecular weight corresponding to 30 KD. In another example of the present invention, different guinea pigs were vaccinated with an adjuvant composition containing an abundant extracellular product isolated from M. tuberculosis having a molecular weight corresponding to 71 KD. Following their respective immunizations both sets of animals and the appropriate controls were exposed to lethal doses of aerosolized M. tuberculosis to determine vaccine effectiveness. </p>[0044] More particularly, in one experiment six guinea pigs were immunized with 100 \u03bcg of 30 KD protein in SAF on three occasions spread over a period of six weeks. Control animals were simultaneously vaccinated with corresponding amounts of a bulk preparation of extracellular proteins (EP) or buffer. Three weeks after the final vaccination, the animals were challenged with an aerosolized lethal dose of M. tuberculosis and monitored for a period of 14 weeks. The 30 KD immunized guinea pigs and those immunized with the bulk extracellular preparation had survival rates of 67% and 50% respectively (illustrating the unexpectedly superior performance of the majorly abundant extracellular product versus EP), while the sham-immunized animals had a survival rate of only 17%. Upon termination of the experiment the animals were sacrificed and examined for viable tubercle bacilli. Unsurprisingly, the non-immunized animal showed markedly higher concentrations of M. tuberculosis in the lungs and spleen. </p>[0045] Similar experiments were performed on those animals vaccinated with 71 KD protein. In one experiment six guinea pigs were vaccinated with an SAF adjuvant composition containing 100 \u03bcg purified 71 KD protein two times over a period of three weeks. Other animals were similarly immunized with a bulk preparation of unpurified extracellular proteins or EP for use as a positive control and with buffer for use as a negative control. Following exposure to lethal doses of aerosolized tubercle bacilli the weight of the guinea pigs was monitored for a period of 6 months. Once again the animals immunized with the purified form of the abundant extracellular product developed protective immunity with respect to the virulent M. tuberculosis. By the end of that period the buffer immunized animals showed a significant loss in weight when compared with the immunized animals. Further, while the positive controls and 71 KD immunized animals had survival rates of 63% and 50% respectively, the non-immunized animals all died before the end of the observation period. </p>[0046] It is important to note that the formulation of the vaccine is not critical to the present invention and may be optimized to facilitate administration. Solutions of the purified immunogenic determinants derived from the majorly abundant pathogenic extracellular products may be administered alone or in combination in any manner designed to generate a protective immune response. The purified protein solutions may be delivered alone, or formulated with an adjuvant before being administered. Specific exemplary adjuvants used in the instant invention to enhance the activity of the selected immunogenic determinants are SAF, adjuvants containing Monophosphoryl Lipid A, Freund's incomplete adjuvant and Freund's complete adjuvant containing killed bacteria. Additional adjuvants that may be useful in the present invention are water-in-oil emulsions, mineral salts (for example, alum), nucleic acids, block polymer surfactants, and microbial cell walls (peptido glycolipids). While not limiting the scope of the invention it is believed that adjuvants may magnify immune responses due to the slow release of antigens from the site of injection. </p>[0047] Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the following detailed description of preferred exemplary embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the figures which will first be described briefly. </p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0048]FIG. 1 is a representation of 4 coomassie blue stained gels, labeled 1A to 1D, illustrating the purification of exemplary majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis as identified by sodium deodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). </p>[0049]FIG. 2 is a tabular representation identifying the five N-terminal amino acids of twelve exemplary majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis and the apparent molecular weight for fourteen such products. </p>[0050]FIG. 3 is a tabular representation of the extended N-terminal amino acid sequence of three exemplary majorly abundant secretory products of M. tuberculosis which were not distinguished by the five N-terminal amino acids shown in FIG. 2. </p>[0051]FIG. 4 is a graphical comparison of the survival rate of guinea pigs immunized with exemplary purified majorly abundant 30 KD secretory product of M. tuberculosis versus positive controls immunized with a prior art bulk preparation of extracellular proteins and non-immunized negative controls following exposure to an aerosolized lethal dose of M. tuberculosis. </p>[0052]FIG. 5 is a graphical comparison of mean guinea pig body weight of animals immunized with purified majorly abundant 71 KD extracellular product versus positive controls immunized with a prior art bulk preparation of extracellular proteins from M. tuberculosis and non-immunized negative controls following exposure to an aerosolized lethal dose of M. tuberculosis. </p>[0053]FIG. 6 is a graphical comparison of the survival rate of guinea pigs immunized in FIG. 5 with exemplary majorly abundant purified 71 KD extracellular product of M. tuberculosis versus positive controls immunized with a prior art bulk preparation of extracellular proteins from M. tuberculosis and non-immunized negative controls following exposure to an aerosolized lethal dose of M. tuberculosis. </p>[0054]FIG. 7 is a graphical comparison of mean guinea pig body weight of animals immunized with exemplary purified majorly abundant 71 KD extracellular product and non-immunized negative controls following exposure to an aerosolized lethal dose of M. tuberculosis in a second, separate experiment. </p>[0055]FIGS. 8A and 8B are graphical comparisons of lymphocyte proliferative responses to exemplary purified majorly abundant 71 KD extracellular product in PPD+ (indicative of infection with M. tuberculosis) and PPD\u2212 human subjects.

    "de as above. Following reconstitution, 150 ml aliquots of the broth were autoclaved for 15 min at 121\u00b0 C. and dispensed into vented Co-star 225 cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks. M. tuberculosis cells stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. as described in the previous paragraph were thawed and used to inoculate 7H11 agar plates. After culture for 7 days, the colonies were scraped from the plates, suspended in a few ml of 7H9 broth, and sonicated in a water bath to form a single cell suspension. The M. tuberculosis cells were suspended in the sterile 150 ml aliquots at an initial optical density of 0.05, as determined by a Perkin-Elmer Junior model 35 spectrophotometer (Norwalk, Conn). The cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air for 3 weeks until the suspension showed an optical density of 0.4 to 0.5. These cultures were used as stock bottles for subsequent cultures also in 7H9 broth. The stock bottles were sonicated in a water bath to form a single cell suspension. The M. tuberculosis cells were then diluted in 7H9 broth to an initial optical density of 0.05 and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sup>2</sup>-95% air for 2\u00bd to 3 weeks until the suspension showed an optical density of 0.4 to 0.5. Culture supernatant was then decanted and filter sterilized sequentially through 0.8 \u03bcm and 0.2 \u03bcm low-protein-binding filters. (Gelman Sciences Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.). The filtrate was then concentrated approximately 35 fold in a Filtron Minisette with an Omega membrane having a 10 KD cutoff and stored at 4\u00b0 C. Analysis of the bulk extracellular protein preparation by sodium deodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed a protein composition with multiple bands. Bulk extracellular protein mixture (EP) was prepared by obtaining a 40-95% ammonium sulfate cut of the culture filtrate. </p>EXAMPLE 2 Purification of Principal Majorly Abundant Extracellular Products of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [0067] Ammonium sulfate (grade I, Sigma) was added to the sterile culture filtrate of Example 1 in concentrations ranging from 10% to 95% at 0\u00b0 C. and gently stirred to fractionate the proteins. The suspension was then transferred to plastic bottles and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 3,000 rpm on a RC3B Sorvall Centrifuge to pellet the resulting precipitate. The supernatant fluid was decanted and, depending on the product of interest, the supernatant fluid or pellet was subjected to further purification. When the product of interest was contained in the supernatant fluid a second ammonium sulfate cut was executed by increasing the salt concentration above that of the first cut. After a period of gentle stirring the solution was then centrifuged as previously described to precipitate the desired product and the second supernatant fluid was subjected to further purification. </p>[0068] Following centrifugation, the precipitated proteins were resolubilized in the appropriate cold buffer and dialyzed extensively in a Spectrapor dialysis membrane (Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles, Calif.) with a 6,000 to 8,000 molecular weight cut-off to remove the salt. Extracellular protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.) and fraction components were determined using SDS-PAGE. The fractions were then applied to chromatography columns for further purification. </p>[0069] Using the general scheme outlined immediately above fourteen extracellular products were purified from the bulk extracellular protein filtrate obtained by the process detailed in Example 1. The exact ammonium sulfate precipitation procedure and chromatography protocol is detailed below for each extracellular product isolated. </p>[0070] A. 110 KD Extracellular Product </p>[0071] 1.

Fractions containing two homogeneous proteins having molecular weights of approximately 12 KD eluted at approximately 300-350 mM NaCl and were collected. The proteins were labeled 12A and 12B and purified as a doublet shown in FIG. 1D, col. 2. </p>[0219] As illustrated in the SDS-PAGE profile of FIG. 1, the principal or majorly abundant extracellular proteins of M. tuberculosis were purified to homogeneity through the use of the protocols detailed in Examples 2A-2N above. More particularly, FIG. 1 illustrates four exemplary 12.5% acrylamide gels developed using SDS-PAGE and labeled 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D. The standard in lane 1 of gels 1A-1C has proteins with molecular weights of 66, 45, 36, 29, 24, 20, and 14 KD. In gel 1D the standard in lane 1 contains proteins with molecular weights of 68, 45, 31, 29, 20, and 14 KD. The lanes containing the respective purified extracellular products show essentially one band at the reported molecular weight of the individual protein. It should be noted that in gel 1D the 12 KD protein runs as a doublet visible in lane 2. Sequence analysis shows that the lower 12 KD (or 12B KD band) is equivalent to the upper 12 KD (or 12A KD) band except that it lacks the first 3 N-terminal amino acids. </p>[0220] Further analysis of these individual exemplary majorly abundant extracellular products is provided in FIG. 2. More particularly FIG. 2 is a tabular compilation of N-terminal sequence data obtained from these purified extracellular products showing that the majority of the isolated products are indeed distinct. Proteins 32A, 32B and 30 all had the same 5 N-terminal amino acids therefore further sequencing was necessary to fully characterize and differentiate them. FIG. 3 shows the extended N-terminal amino acid sequences for these three purified secretory products. Different amino acids at positions 16, 31 and 36 demonstrate that these isolated proteins are distinct from one another despite their similarity in molecular weight. </p>[0221] In addition to proteins 30, 32A and 32B, extended N-terminal amino acid sequences of other majorly abundant extracellular products were determined to provide primary structural data and to uncover possible relationships between the proteins. Sequencing was performed on the extracellular products purified according to Example 2 using techniques well known in the art. Varying lengths of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, determined for each individual extracellular product, are shown below identified by the apparent molecular weight of the intact protein, and represented using standard one letter abbreviations for the naturally occurring amino acids.

The analysis described indicates that these proteins constitute the majority of the extracellular products of M. tuberculosis, with the 71 KD, 30 KD, 32A KD, 23 KD and 16 KD products comprising approximately 60% by weight of the total available extracellular product. It is further estimated that the 30 KD protein may constitute up to 25% by weight of the total products released by M. tuberculosis. Thus, individual exemplary majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis useful in the practice of the present invention may range anywhere from approximately 0.5% up to approximately 25% of the total weight of the extracellular products. </p>[0223] As previously discussed, following the inability of traditional Western blot analysis to consistently identify the most immunogenically specific extracellular products, the present inventor decided to analyze the immunogenicity of the majorly abundant extracellular products based upon their abundance and consequent ease of identification and isolation. Surprisingly, it was found that these majorly abundant extracellular products induce unexpectedly effective immune responses leading this inventor to conclude that they may function as vaccines. This surprising discovery led to the development of the non-limiting functional theory of this invention discussed above. </p>[0224] To demonstrate the efficacy of the present invention, additional experiments were conducted using individual majorly abundant extracellular products and combinations thereof at various exemplary dosages to induce protective immunity in art accepted laboratory models. More specifically, purified individual majorly abundant extracellular products were used to induce protective immunity in guinea pigs which were then challenged with M. tuberculosis. Upon showing that these proteins were capable of inducing protective immunity, combinations of five purified majorly abundant extracellular products was similarly tested using differing routes of administration. In particular the 30 KD abundant extracellular product was used to induce protective immunity in the accepted animal model as was the purified form of the 71 KD extracellular product. As with the individual exemplary majorly abundant extracellular products the combination vaccines of five majorly abundant extracellular products conferred protection against challenge with lethal doses of M. tuberculosis as well. Results of the various studies of these exemplary vaccines of the present invention follow. </p>[0225] Specific pathogen-free male Hartley strain guinea pigs (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, North Wilmington, Mass.) were used in all experiments involving immunogenic or aerosol challenges with M. tuberculosis. The animals were housed two or three to a stainless steel cage and allowed free access to standard guinea pig chow and water. After arrival at the animal facility, the guinea pigs were observed for at least one week prior to the start of each experiment to ensure that they were healthy. </p>[0226] Initial experiments were conducted using individual majorly abundant extracellular products believed to comprise between 3% to 25% of the total extracellular proteins normally present. These experiments demonstrate that majorly abundant extracellular products elicit an effective immune response. More particularly, isolated 30 KD and 71 KD extracellular products were shown to be individually capable of generating a cell-mediated immune response that protected guinea pigs upon exposure to lethal doses of M. tuberculosis as follows. </p>EXAMPLE 3 Purified 30 KD Protein Skin Testing for Cell-Mediated Immunity of 30 KD Immunized Guinea Pigs [0227] To illustrate that a measurable immune response can be induced by purified forms of abundant extracellular products, a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay was performed. Guinea pigs were immunized with the exemplary majorly abundant M. tuberculosis 30 KD secretory product purified according to Example 2 and believed to comprise approximately 25% of the total extracellular product of M. tuberculosis. In three independent experiments, guinea pigs were immunized three times three weeks apart with 100 \u03bcg of substantially purified 30 KD protein in SAF adjuvant. Control animals were similarly injected with buffer in SAF. Three weeks after the last immunization the guinea pigs were challenged with the exemplary 30 KD protein in a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay. </p>[0228] Guinea pigs were shaved over the back and injections of 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcg of 30 KD protein were administered intradermally with resulting erythema (redness of the skin) and induration measured after 24 hours as shown in Table A below. Data are reported in terms of mean measurement values for the group\u00b1standard error (SE) as determined using traditional methods.

In contrast, the control animals exhibited minimal response. </p>[0230] To confirm the immunoreactivity of the 30 KD secretory product and show its applicability to infectious tuberculosis, non-immunized guinea pigs were infected with M. tuberculosis and challenged with this protein as follows. </p>EXAMPLE 4 Purified 30 KD Protein Testing for Cell-Mediated Immune Responses of Guinea Pigs Infected With M. tuberculosis [0231] To obtain bacteria for use in experiments requiring the infection of guinea pigs, M. tuberculosis was first cultured on 7H11 agar and passaged once through a guinea pig lung to insure that they were virulent. For this purpose, guinea pigs were challenged by aerosol with a 10 ml suspension of bacteria in 7H9 broth containing approximately 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>bacteria/ml. After the guinea pigs became ill, the animals were sacrificed and the lungs, containing prominent M. tuberculosis lesions, were removed. Each lung was ground up and cultured on 7H11 agar for 7 days to 10 days. The bacteria were scraped from the plates, diluted in 7H9 broth containing 10% glycerol, sonicated in a water bath to obtain a single cell suspension, and frozen slowly at \u221270\u00b0 C. at a concentration of approximately 2\u00d710<sup>7 </sup>viable bacteria/ml. Viability of the frozen cells was measured by thawing the bacterial suspension and culturing serial dilutions of the suspension on 7H11 agar. Just before a challenge, a vial of bacterial cells was thawed and diluted to the desired concentration in 7H9 broth. </p>[0232] The guinea pigs were exposed to aerosols of the viable M. tuberculosis in a specially designed lucite aerosol chamber. The aerosol chamber measured 14 by 13 by 24 in. and contained two 6 inch diameter portals on opposite sides for introducing or removing guinea pigs. The aerosol inlet was located at the center of the chamber ceiling. A vacuum pump (Gast Mfg. Co., Benton Harbor, Mich.) delivered air at 30 lb/in<sup>2 </sup>to a nebulizer-venturi unit (Mes Inc., Burbank, Calif.), and an aerosol was generated from a 10-ml suspension of bacilli. A 0.2 \u03bcm breathing circuit filter unit (Pall Biomedical Inc., Fajardo, Puerto Rico) was located at one end of the chamber to equilibrate the pressure inside and outside of the assembly. Due to safety considerations, the aerosol challenges were conducted with the chamber placed completely within a laminar flow hood. </p>[0233] The animals were exposed to pathogenic aerosol for 30 minutes during which time the suspension of bacilli in the nebulizer was completely exhausted. Each aerosol was generated from the 10 ml suspension containing approximately 5.0\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>bacterial particles per ml. Previous studies have shown that guinea pig exposure to this concentration of bacteria consistently produces infections in non-protected animals. Following aerosol infection, the guinea pigs were housed in stainless steel cages contained within a laminar flow biohazard safety enclosure (Airo Clean Engineering Inc., Edgemont, Pa.) and observed for signs of illness. The animals were allowed free access to standard guinea pig chow and water throughout the experiment. </p>[0234] In this experiment, the infected guinea pigs were sacrificed and splenic lymphocyte proliferation was measured in response to various concentrations of the 30 KD protein. More specifically, splenic lymphocytes were obtained and purified as described by Brieman and Horwitz (J. Exp. Med. 164:799-811) which is incorporated herein by reference. The lymphocytes were adjusted to a final concentration of 10<sup>7</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.) containing penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO) and incubated with various concentrations of purified 30 KD secretory product in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl in microtest wells (96-well round-bottom tissue culture plate; Falcon Labware, Oxnard, Calif.) for 2 days at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air and 100% humidity. Noninfected animals were used as negative controls. At the end of the incubation period, 0.25 \u03bcCi of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) was added to each well and the cells were further incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air at 100% humidity. A multisample automated cell harvester (Skatron Inc., Sterling, Va.) was used to wash each well, and the effluent was passed through a filtermat (Skatron). Filtermat sections representing separate microtest wells were placed in scintillation vials, and 2 ml of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail (National Diagnostics, Manville, N.J.) was added. Beta particle emission was measured in a beta scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). </p>[0235] Tissue samples from the infected and noninfected guinea pigs were assayed against 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml of isolated 30 KD secretory protein. Samples were then monitored for their ability to incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine. The results of these assays were tabulated and presented in Table B below. </p>[0236] Data are reported as a stimulation index which, for the purposes of this disclosure, is defined as: mean [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation of lymphocytes incubated with antigen/mean [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation of lymphocytes incubated without antigen.  \nTABLE BStimulation Indices to 30 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Guinea PigStatusn1.0 \u03bcg10.0 \u03bcgInfected62.2 \u00b1 0.29.7 \u00b1 4.6Controls61.5 \u00b1 0.32.0 \u00b1 0.8\n</p>[0237] As shown in Table B, the cells of the infected animals exhibited a strong response to the exemplary 30 KD protein as manifested by dose dependant splenic lymphocyte proliferation in response to exposure to this majorly abundant secretory product. Conversely, the uninfected control animals showed little lymphocyte proliferation. Accordingly, the 30 KD secretory product clearly induces a cell-mediated immune response in mammals infected with M. tuberculosis. </p>[0238] To illustrate the protective aspects of the vaccines of the present invention, guinea pigs were immunized with purified 30 KD protein and exposed to M. tuberculosis as follows. </p>EXAMPLE 5 Challenge of 30 KD Immunized Guinea Pig with Aerosolized M. tuberculosis [0239] As before, the animals were immunized three times at three week intervals with 100 \u03bcg of the exemplary 30 KD secretory protein in SAF. Control guinea pigs were immunized with 120 \u03bcg of bulk EP in SAF or sham-immunized with buffer in the same adjuvant. Three weeks after the last immunization, the animals were challenged with aerosolized M. tuberculosis as described in Example 4. The survival rates for the three groups of animals were monitored and are graphically presented in FIG. 4. Absolute mortality was determined 14 weeks after challenge as presented in Table C below.  \nTABLE CSurvivors/PercentStatus of Guinea PigsChallengedSurvival30 KD Immunized4/667%EP Immunized3/650%Sham Immunized1/617%\n</p>[0240] As shown in FIG. 4 guinea pigs immunized three times with the exemplary 30 KD protein were protected against death. Approximately 67% of the guinea pigs immunized with the 30 KD protein survived whereas only 17% of the control sham-immunized guinea pigs survived. </p>[0241] Weight retention of the immunized animals was also monitored (data not shown) and further illustrates the prophylactic capacity of vaccines incorporating majorly abundant extracellular products produced by pathogenic bacteria as taught by the present invention. While the immunized animals appeared to maintain their weight, the high mortality rate of the sham-immunized animals precluded the graphical comparison between the immunized animals and the control animals. </p>[0242] Following conclusion of the weight monitoring study, the surviving animals were sacrificed and the right lung and spleen of each animal was assayed for viable M. tuberculosis. The animals were soaked in 2% amphyl solution (National Laboratories, Montvale, N.J.), and the lungs and spleen were removed aseptically. The number of macroscopic primary surface lesions in the lungs were enumerated by visual inspection. Colony forming units (CFU) of M. tuberculosis in the right lung and spleen were determined by homogenizing each organ in 10 ml of 7H9 with a mortar and pestle and 90-mesh Norton Alundum (Fisher), serially diluting the tissue homogenate in 7H9, and culturing the dilutions on duplicate plates of 7H11 agar by using drops of 0.1 ml/drop. All plates were kept in modular incubator chambers and incubated 12 to 14 days at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% air at 100% humidity. The assay was conducted using this protocol and the results of the counts are presented in Table D below in terms of mean colony forming units (CFU)\u00b1standard error (SE).  \nTABLE DMean CFU \u00b1 SEGuinea PigStatusnRight LungSpleen30 KD Immunized43.4 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>7.7 \u00b1 3.9 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>Sham-immunized11.8 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup>8.5 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>Log-Difference0.731.04\n</p>[0243] As shown in Table D, immunization with the exemplary 30 KD secretory protein limited the growth of M. tuberculosis in the lung and the spleen. Although only data from the one surviving sham-immunized animal was available for comparative purposes, the four surviving 30 KD immunized animals had 0.7 log fewer CFU in their lungs and 1 log fewer CFU in their spleen than the surviving sham-immunized animal. Based on previous demonstrations of a high correlation between CFU counts and mortality, the surviving animal likely had fewer CFU in the lungs and spleen than the animals who died before a CFU analysis could be performed. Again this reduction of CFU in the lungs and spleens of the immunized animals conclusively demonstrates the scope and operability of the present invention. </p>[0244] The immunoprotective potential of another majorly abundant extracellular product from M. tuberculosis, the 71 KD extracellular product, was tested in its isolated form to demonstrate its immunoprotective capacity. </p>EXAMPLE 6 Purified 71 KD Protein Skin Test of Guinea Pigs Immunized with a Bulk Preparation of EP [0245] To demonstrate the potential of 71 KD protein to provoke an effective immune response in animals, this isolated majorly abundant extracellular product was used to skin test guinea pigs immunized with a bulk preparation of M. tuberculosis extracellular proteins (EP) in a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay. As discussed above, bulk EP will impart acquired immunity against infection by M. tuberculosis but to a lesser extent than the vaccines of the present invention. </p>[0246] Guinea pigs were immunized on two occasions spaced three weeks apart, with 120 \u03bcg of a bulk preparation of EP prepared as detailed in Example 1. The vaccination was prepared in incomplete Freunds adjuvant with sham-immunized animals receiving buffer in place of EP. Three weeks after the last vaccination the guinea pigs from each group were shaved over the back and skin tested with an intradermal injection of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 \u03bcg of 71 KD protein. 10.0 \u03bcg of buffer was used as a control and all injections were performed using a total volume of 0.1 ml. The diameters of erythema and induration were measured after 24 hours with the results as shown in Table E below. Data are reported in terms of mean measurement values for the group\u00b1standard error (SE) as determined using traditional methods.  \nTABLE EGuinea PigStatusn0.1 \u03bcg1.0 \u03bcg10.0 \u03bcgErythema (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized46.5 \u00b1 0.711.9 \u00b1 1.4\u200218.9 \u00b1 2.2\u2002Controls32.5 \u00b1 1.45.0 \u00b1 2.911.8 \u00b1 2.1\u2002Induration (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized43.6 \u00b1 1.16.8 \u00b1 1.111.6 \u00b1 0.8\u2002Controls30.7 \u00b1 0.73.7 \u00b1 0.97.8 \u00b1 1.0\n</p>[0247] The responses of the immunized animals were almost twice the response of the guinea pigs challenged with buffer alone and were comparable to those challenged with bulk EP identical to that used to immunize the animals (data not shown). </p>[0248] To further confirm that the purified exemplary 71 KD majorly abundant extracellular product elicits cell-mediated immune responses, the bulk EP immunized guinea pigs were sacrificed and splenic lymphocyte proliferation was measured in response to various concentrations of the 71 KD protein. Nonimmunized animals were used as controls. Following the protocol of Example 4, the lymphocytes were incubated with and without 71 KD protein for 2 days and then assayed for their capacity to incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine. </p>[0249] Data is reported in terms of stimulation indices calculated as in Example 4. The results of this 71 KD challenge are shown in Table F below.  \nTABLE FGuinea PigStatusn0.01 \u03bcg/ml0.1 \u03bcg/ml1.0 \u03bcg/mlStimulation Indices to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized41.5 \u00b1 0.12.3 \u00b1 0.58.1 \u00b1 2.2Controls21.7 \u00b1 0.61.6 \u00b1 0.42.5 \u00b1 0.6Stimulation Indices to EP (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized41.5 \u00b1 0.12.2 \u00b1 0.35.3 \u00b1 1.4Controls21.4 \u00b1 0.21.5 \u00b1 0.21.2 \u00b1 0.1\n</p>[0250] As shown in Table F, stimulation indices for the lymphocyte proliferation assay were comparable to the results obtained in the cutaneous hypersensitivity assay. Both the 71 KD and bulk EP tested samples showed responses between two and three times higher than those obtained with the controls indicating that isolated exemplary 71 KD majorly abundant extracellular product is capable of provoking a cell-mediated immune response in animals immunized with M. tuberculosis extracts. However, it should again be emphasized that the purified majorly abundant or principal extracellular product is free of the problems associated with prior art or bulk compositions and is more readily adaptable to synthetic and commercial production making the vaccines of the present invention superior to the prior art. </p>[0251] More particularly the bulk preparation cannot be manufactured easily on a large scale through modern biomolecular techniques. Any commercial production of these unrefined bulk preparations containing all extracellular products would involve culturing vast amounts of the target pathogen or a closely related species and harvesting the resultant supernatant fluid. Such production methodology is highly susceptible to contamination by the target pathogen, toxic byproducts or other parasitic agents. Further, the large number of immunogenic determinants in such a preparation is far more likely to provoke a toxic immune reaction in a susceptible segment of the immunized population. Using these unrefined bulk preparations also negates the use of the most popular skin tests currently used for tuberculosis screening and control. </p>[0252] In direct contrast, the vaccines of the present invention can be mass-produced in relative safety using high yield transformed hosts. Similarly, the vaccines of the present invention can be produced in identical, easy to standardize batches as opposed to the wider variable production of bulk extracellular products. Moreover, as the number of immunogenic determinants presented to the host immune system is relatively small, toxic reactions and the chance of invalidating popular screening tests are greatly reduced. </p>EXAMPLE 7 Purified 71 KD Protein Skin Test of 71 KD Immunized Guinea Pigs [0253] Following demonstration that the isolated exemplary 71 KD majorly abundant extracellular product generates a cell-mediated immune response in bulk EP immunized animals, it was shown that the purified form of this majorly abundant product was able to induce a cell-mediated immune response in animals immunized with 71 KD. </p>[0254] Guinea pigs were twice vaccinated with 100 \u03bcg of purified 71 KD protein in SAF three weeks apart. Control animals were sham-immunized with buffer in SAF on the same schedule. Three weeks after the last immunization both sets of animals were intradermally challenged with 1 and 10 \u03bcg of isolated 71 KD protein. The resulting erythema and indurations were measured after 24 hours with the results shown in Table G below.  \nTABLE GGuinea PigStatusn0 \u03bcg1.0 \u03bcg10.0 \u03bcgErythema (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized30 \u00b1 06.5 \u00b1 1.515.0 \u00b1 1.5\u2002Controls30 \u00b1 02.7 \u00b1 1.36.7 \u00b1 1.3Induration (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Immunized30 \u00b1 03.0 \u00b1 1.09.3 \u00b1 0.3Controls30 \u00b1 00 \u00b1 01.3 \u00b1 1.3\n</p>[0255] The extent of induration and erythema was much greater in the immunized animals than in the non-immunized control animals demonstrating that a strong cell-mediated immune response to 71 KD protein had been initiated by the vaccination protocol of the present invention. </p>[0256] To further confirm the capacity of this abundant extracellular product to induce an effective immune response on its own in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, lymphocyte proliferation assays were performed. Animals immunized as in Table G were sacrificed and splenic lymphocyte proliferative assays were run using the protocol established in Example 4. The tissue samples from the 71 KD immunized guinea pigs and those from the control guinea pigs were challenged with 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml of isolated 71 KD protein and monitored for their ability to incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine. Stimulation indices were calculated as previously described. The results of these assays are presented in Table H below.  \nTABLE HStimulation Indices to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Guinea PigStatusn0.1 \u03bcg/ml1.0 \u03bcg/ml10.0 \u03bcg/mlImmunized34.0 \u00b1 1.35.6 \u00b1 2.512.2 \u00b1 5.1\u2002Controls31.3 \u00b1 0.31.3 \u00b1 0.33.2 \u00b1 1.5\n</p>[0257] As with the cutaneous hypersensitivity assay, the 71 KD immunized animals showed a much higher response to purified 71 KD than did the sham-immunized controls. Though expected of a foreign protein, such results clearly show that a majorly abundant extracellular product has the capacity to induce an cell-mediated immune response. </p>[0258] After establishing that an isolated majorly abundant extracellular protein will induce an effective cell-mediated immune response, further experiments were conducted to confirm that any such response is cross-reactive against tubercle bacilli as follows. </p>EXAMPLE 8 Purified 71 KD Protein Challenge of Guinea Pigs Infected with M. tuberculosis [0259] Non-immunized guinea pigs were infected with aerosolized M. tuberculosis as reported in Example 4. Purified protein derivative (PPD-CT68; Connaught Laboratories Ltd.) was employed as the positive control to ensure that the infected animals were demonstrating a cell-mediated immune response indicative of M. tuberculosis. Widely used in the Mantoux test for tuberculosis exposure, PPD is generally prepared by ammonium sulfate fractionation and comprises a mixture of small proteins having an average molecular weight of approximately 10 KD. Immune responses to PPD are substantially analogous to those provoked by the bulk EP fractions isolated in Example 1. </p>[0260] Three weeks after infection the guinea pigs were challenged intradermally with 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcg of the exemplary purified majorly abundant 71 KD extracellular protein. Uninfected animals used as controls were similarly challenged with the isolated protein. The extent of erythema and induration were measured 24 hours later with the results reported in Table I below.  \nTABLE IGuinea PigStatusn0.1 \u03bcg1.0 \u03bcg10.0 \u03bcgErythema (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Infected79.5 \u00b1 1.713.4 \u00b1 1.3\u200219.7 \u00b1 1.3\u2002Controls62.3 \u00b1 2.33.5 \u00b1 2.27.8 \u00b1 1.9Induration (mm) to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Infected75.3 \u00b1 1.88.7 \u00b1 1.613.4 \u00b1 1.1\u2002Controls60 \u00b1 00.8 \u00b1 0.80 \u00b1 0\n</p>[0261] As shown in Table I, strong immune responses are present in the infected animals challenged with the exemplary purified majorly abundant extracellular protein of the present invention. These responses are on the order of three to four times greater for erythema and more than 10 times greater for induration than those of the uninfected animals, confirming that the prominent 71 KD extracellular protein induces a strong cell-mediated immune response in M. tuberculosis-infected animals. </p>[0262] To further corroborate these results the infected animals and uninfected animals were sacrificed and subjected to a lymphocyte proliferative assay according to the protocol of Example 4. The tissue samples from both sets of guinea pigs were assayed against 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml of isolated 71 KD protein and PPD. The samples were then monitored for their ability to incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine as previously described with the results of these assays presented in Table J below.  \nTABLE JGuinea PigStatusn0.1 \u03bcg/ml1.0 \u03bcg/ml10.0 \u03bcg/mlStimulation Indices to 71 KD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Infected32.4 \u00b1 0.56.2 \u00b1 1.829.1 \u00b1 16.2Controls31.1 \u00b1 0.12.6 \u00b1 0.818.2 \u00b1 6.1\u2002Stimulation Indices to PPD (Mean \u00b1 SE)Infected31.0 \u00b1 0.14.0 \u00b1 1.511.4 \u00b1 3.4\u2002Controls30.9 \u00b1 0.2\u20020.9 \u00b1 0.031.5 \u00b1 0.3\n</p>[0263] As with the results of the cutaneous sensitivity assay, Table J shows that the stimulation indices were much higher for the infected tissue than for the uninfected samples. More specifically, the mean peak stimulation index of infected animals was 2-fold higher to the exemplary 71 KD protein and 3-fold higher to PPD than it was to uninfected controls confirming that a strong cell-mediated immune response is induced in animals infected with M. tuberculosis by the exemplary majorly abundant extracellular protein vaccines of the present invention. </p>[0264] Following this demonstration of cross-reactivity between the exemplary purified 71 KD majorly abundant protein and M. tuberculosis, additional experiments were performed to demonstrate that an effective immune response could be stimulated by these exemplary purified samples of the majorly abundant extracellular products as disclosed by the present invention. </p>EXAMPLE 9 Challenge of 71 KD Immunized Guinea Pigs with Aerosolized M. tuberculosis [0265] To demonstrate the immunoprotective capacity of exemplary majorly abundant or principal extracellular protein vaccines, guinea pigs were immunized twice, 3 weeks apart, with 100 \u03bcg of the exemplary majorly abundant 71 KD protein purified according to Example 2. Control animals were immunized with 120 \u03bcg bulk EP from Example 1 or buffer. All animals were immunized using the adjuvant SAF. Three weeks after the last immunization, guinea pigs immunized with the exemplary 71 KD protein were skin-tested with 10 \u03bcg of the material to evaluate whether a cell-mediated immune response had developed. The control animals and 71 KD immunized guinea pigs were then infected with aerosolized M. tuberculosis as detailed in Example 4. Following infection the animals were monitored and weighed for six months. </p>[0266] The graph of FIG. 5 contrasts the weight loss experienced by the sham-immunized group to the relatively normal weight gain shown by the 71 KD and bulk EP immunized animals. Data are the mean weights\u00b1SE for each group. Mortality curves for the same animals are shown in the graph of FIG. 6. The absolute mortality rates for the study are reported in Table K below.  \nTABLE KSurvivors/PercentStatus of Guinea PigsChallengedSurvival71 KD Immunized3/650%EP Immunized5/8\u2009\u200262.5%Sham Immunized0/6\u20020%\n</p>[0267] Both the weight loss curves and the mortality rates clearly show that the majorly abundant extracellular proteins of the present invention confer a prophylactic immune response. This is emphasized by the fact that 100% of the non-immunized animals died before the end of the monitoring period. </p>EXAMPLE 10 Challenge of 71 KD Immunized Guinea Pigs with Aerosolized M. tuberculosis [0268] A similar experiment was conducted to verify the results of the previous Example and show that the administration of an exemplary principal extracellular protein can confer a protective immune response in animals. In this experiment, guinea pigs were again immunized three times, 3 weeks apart, with 100 \u03bcg of the 71 KD extracellular protein in SAF. Control guinea pigs were sham-immunized with buffer in SAF. Three weeks after the last immunization, the animals were challenged with aerosolized M. tuberculosis and weighed weekly for 13 weeks. Mean weights\u00b1SE for each group of 6 guinea pigs were calculated and are graphically represented in FIG. 7. This curve shows that the sham-immunized animals lost a considerable amount of weight over the monitoring period while the immunized animals maintained a fairly consistent body weight. As loss of body mass or \u201cconsumption\u201d is one of the classical side effects of tuberculosis, these results indicate that the growth and proliferation of tubercle bacilli in the immunized animals was inhibited by the exemplary vaccine of the present invention. </p>[0269] Protective immunity having been developed in guinea pigs through vaccination with an abundant extracellular product in an isolated form, experiments were run to demonstrate the inter-species immunoreactivity of the vaccines of the present invention and to further confirm the validity and applicability of the guinea pig model. </p>EXAMPLE 11 Testing Cell-Mediated Immunity of PPD Positive Humans with Purified 71 KD Protein [0270] To assess the cell-mediated component of a human immune response to the exemplary 71 KD majorly abundant protein, the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from PPD-positive and PPD-negative individuals to the protein were studied in the standard lymphocyte proliferation assay as reported in Example 4 above. A positive PPD, or tuberculin, response is well known in the art as being indicative of previous exposure to M. tuberculosis. The proliferative response and corresponding incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine were measured at two and four days. Data for these studies is shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B. FIG. 8A shows the response to various levels of 71 KD after two days while FIG. 8B shows the same responses at four days. </p>[0271] As illustrated in FIGS. 8A and 8B, the mean peak stimulation index of PPD-positive individuals was twofold higher to the 71 KD protein and threefold higher to PPD than that of PPD negative individuals. Among PPD-positive individuals, there was a linear correlation between the peak stimulation indices to the exemplary 71 KD protein and to PPD demonstrating that a strong cell-mediated response is stimulated by the most prominent or majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis in humans previously exposed to M. tuberculosis. This data corresponds to the reactivity profile seen in guinea pigs and confirms the applicability of the guinea pig model to other mammals subject to infection. </p>[0272] Thus, as with the previously discussed 30 KD exemplary protein, the development of a strong immune response to the majorly abundant 71 KD extracellular product demonstrates the broad scope of the present invention as evidenced by the fact that the 71 KD product is also effective at stimulating cell-mediated immunity in humans. </p>[0273] Again, it should be emphasized that the present invention is not limited to the extracellular products of M. tuberculosis or to the use of the exemplary 71 KD protein. Rather the teachings of the present invention are applicable to any majorly abundant extracellular product as demonstrated in the examples. </p>[0274] Additional studies were performed in order to ascertain whether combinations of majorly abundant extracellular products of M. tuberculosis would provide protective immunity as well. In general, these studies utilized guinea pigs which were immunized either intradermally or subcutaneously with various dosages of vaccines comprising combinations of 5 purified extracellular proteins of M. tuberculosis in SAF three times, 3 or 4 weeks apart. </p>[0275] The first protein combination used for the immunization procedure, labeled Combination I, was comprised of 71 KD, 32A KD, 30 KD, 23 KD, and 16 KD proteins purified according to the protocols described in Example 2. This combination is believed to comprise up to 60% of the total extracellular protein normally present in M. tuberculosis culture supernatants. These proteins selected for use in Combination I, are identified with an asterisk in FIG. 2. Combination I vaccine containing 100 \u03bcg, 20 \u03bcg, or 2 \u03bcg of each protein was administered intradermally with the adjuvant SAF. Combination I vaccine containing 20 \u03bcg of each protein was also administered subcutaneously in similar experiments. Negative control guinea pigs were sham-immunized with equivalent volumes of SAF and buffer on the same schedule while positive controls were immunized using 120 \u03bcg of the bulk extracellular protein preparation from Example 1 in SAF. All injection volumes were standardized using buffer. </p>EXAMPLE 12 Response of Combination I Immunized Guinea Pigs to a Challenge with Combination I Vaccine [0276] To determine if the animals had developed a measurable immune response following vaccination with the Combination I mixture of principal extracellular products, a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay was performed. Guinea pigs were shaved over the back and injected intradermally with 1.0 \u03bcg and 10.0 \u03bcg of the same combination of the five purified extracellular proteins. 10.0 \u03bcg of buffer was used as a control and all injections were performed using a total volume of 0.1 ml. The diameters of erythema and induration at skin tests sites were measured ",

In particular, combinations IV and VII proved to be especially effective, reducing the average number of colony forming units by roughly a factor of ten. Animals immunized with Combinations V and VIII had 0.3 and 0.1 log fewer colony forming units (CFU), respectively, in their spleens on average, than sham-immunized controls. This dramatic reduction in colony forming units in the animals immunized in accordance with the teachings of the present invention once again illustrates the immunoprotective operability of the present invention. </p>EXAMPLE 19 Response of Guinea Pigs Immunized with 3 Different Dosages of Combination XIII to a Challenge with Combination XIII [0305] To further define the operability and scope of the present invention as well as to demonstrate the efficacy of additional combinations of purified extracellular products, guinea pigs were immunized as before using alternative vaccination dosages. Specifically, 50 \u03bcg, 100 \u03bcg and 200 \u03bcg of an alternative combination of 3 majorly abundant extracellular products identified as Combination XIII and comprising the 30 KD, 32(A) KD, and 16 KD proteins. As with the preceding examples, groups of animals were immunized intradermally 4 times, 3 weeks apart with the alternative dosages of Combination XIII in SAF. </p>[0306] A cutaneous hypersensitivity assay was performed to determine if the animals had developed a measurable immune response following vaccination. The animals were shaved over the back and injected intradermally with Combination XIII containing 10.0 \u03bcg of each of the purified extracellular products. All injections were performed using a total volume of 0.1 ml. Sham-immunized controls were also skin-tested with the same dosage of Combination XIII. The diameters of erythema and induration at skin- test sites were measured 24 hours after injection. </p>[0307] The results are presented in Table S below in terms of mean measurement values for the group\u00b1standard error (SE) as determined using traditional methods  \nTABLE SVaccineVaccineDiameter of Skin Reaction (mm)CombinationDose (\u03bcg)ErythemaIndurationXIII5017.8 \u00b1 1.313.2 \u00b1 1.0\u2002XIII10011.2 \u00b1 0.97.3 \u00b1 0.4XIII20010.0 \u00b1 0.77.0 \u00b1 0.4Sham0\u20025.7 \u00b1 0.50.2 \u00b1 0.2\n</p>[0308] Once again, these results clearly demonstrate that a strong cell-mediated immune response to Combination XIII was generated in animals immunized with each of the three dosages of Combination XIII. The immunized animals exhibited erythema about two to three times that of controls. Even more strikingly, the immunized animals exhibited induration at least 35 fold that of control animals which exhibi",

Sham-immunized animals lost approximately 22% of their total combined body weight. In contrast the prophylactic effect of the combination vaccines resulted in actual weight gain for one of the test groups and a reduced amount of weight loss in the others. Specifically, animals immunized with Combination XIV evidenced a 3% weight gain while those animals immunized with the other combinations lost only 4% to 15% of their total combined weight. </p>[0321] These results are shown graphically in FIG. 11 which plots weekly weight determinations in terms of net weight gain or loss for each group of animals following aerosolized challenge . This statistically significant difference between the net weight loss for the immunized animals and the sham-immunized controls shown in FIG. 11 provides further evidence for the immunoprophylactic response generated by the combination vaccines of the present invention. </p>EXAMPLE 23 Cell-Mediated Immunity in Guinea Pigs Immunized with Three Different Adjuvants [0322] In order to further demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of the vaccine formulations of the present invention, immunogenic studies were conducted using different adjuvants. Specifically three different immunogens, purified 30 KD protein, Combination I (30, 32A, 16, 23, 71) and Combination XIII (30, 32A, 16) were each formulated using three different adjuvants, Syntex Adjuvant Formulation I (SAF), incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA) and Monophosphoryl Lipid A containing adjuvant (MPL). Such adjuvants are generally known to enhance the immune response of an organism when administered with an immunogen. </p>[0323] Guinea pigs were immunized intradermally with 100 \u03bcg of each protein comprising Combinations I and XIII and approximately 100 \u03bcg of purified 30 KD protein in each of the three different adjuvant formulations. The guinea pigs were immunized with each formulation a total of three times with injections three weeks apart. </p>[0324] Following immunization, a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay was performed to determine if the guinea pigs had developed a measurable immune response. Guinea pigs were shaved over the back and injected intradermally with the same immunogen to which they had been immunized. For the challenge, 10 \u03bcg of each protein in Combinations I and XIII or 10 \u03bcg of purified 30 KD protein was injected in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. Sham-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated with one of the three adjuvants, were skin-tested with each of the immunogen formulations containing the same adjuvant. The diameters of erythema and induration at skin test sites were measured 24 hours after challenge as described in Example 3. </p>[0325] The results of these measurements are presented in Table X below. As previously discussed data are reported in terms of mean measurement values for the group\u00b1standard error as determined using accepted statistical techniques.  \nTABLE XSkinDiameter of SkinTestReaction (mm)VaccineAdjuvantReagentErythemaInduration30SAF3010.7 \u00b1 1.6\u20025.8 \u00b1 1.530IFA308.8 \u00b1 0.74.6 \u00b1 0.730MPL3010.2 \u00b1 1.7\u20025.3 \u00b1 1.5XIIISAFXIII7.3 \u00b1 0.54.1 \u00b1 0.5XIIIIFAXIII6.8 \u00b1 0.93.5 \u00b1 0.5XIIIMPLXIII6.3 \u00b1 0.43.4 \u00b1 0.3ISAFI6.9 \u00b1 0.64.0 \u00b1 0.3IIFAI6.8 \u00b1 0.23.6 \u00b1 0.3IMPLI7.4 \u00b1 0.43.9 \u00b1 0.5ShamSAF300.7 \u00b1 0.71.0 \u00b1 0\u2002\u2009ShamIFA300 \u00b1 00 \u00b1 0ShamMPL300 \u00b1 00 \u00b1 0ShamSAFXIII1.0 \u00b1 1.01.0 \u00b1 0\u2002\u2009ShamIFAXIII0 \u00b1 00.3 \u00b1 0.3ShamMPLXIII0 \u00b1 00 \u00b1 0ShamSAFI4.7 \u00b1 0.31.0 \u00b1 0\u2002\u2009ShamIFAI2.0 \u00b1 1.00.7 \u00b1 0.3ShamMPLI1.0 \u00b1 1.00.7 \u00b1 0.3\n</p>[0326] As shown in the data presented in Table X, the combination vaccines and purified extracellular products of the present invention provide a strong cell-mediated immunogenic response when formulated with different adjuvants.
