Exp. Med., 183, 2437-2448 (1996) and Uguccioni et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100, 11371143 (1997). Cell lines for expressing the receptor of interest include those naturally expressing the chemokine receptor, such as EOL-3 or THP-1, those induced to express the chemokine receptor by the addition of chemical or protein agents, such as HL-60 or AML14.3D10 cells treated with, for example, butyric acid with interleukin-5 present, or a cell engineered to express a recombinant chemokine receptor, such as CHO or HEK-293. Finally, blood or tissue cells, for example human peripheral blood eosinophils, isolated using methods as described by Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 145, 105-110 (1991), can be utilized in such assays. In particular, the compound of the present invention have activity in binding to the CCR-3 receptor in the aforementioned assays. As used herein, \u201cactivity\u201d is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an IC50 of 10 mM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity. A general binding protocol is described below.</p>CCR3-Receptor Binding ProtocolThe CCR3 receptor binding test is based on a K562 cell line (leukemia myelogenic blast cells) transfected with the human chemokine receptor CCR3 (hCCR3-C1). The cell membranes were prepared by disrupting the hCCR3 transfected K562 cells by nitrogen decomposition and centrifugation at 40000 g, 4\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The membranes were resuspendet in the SPA incubation buffer (see below) without bovine serum albumin for storage in aliquots at \u221280 degrees C.</p>The CCR3 receptor binding assay with the radioligand <sup>125</sup>Jodine-eotaxin-1 was performed in a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) design. Cell membranes of hCCR3 C1 cells were diluted in suitable concentrations (0.5-5 ug protein/well) in 96 well microtiter plates (1450-401, Wallac).</p>The test incubation mixture comprising 60 \u03bcl of the membrane suspension, 80 \u03bcl of the Wheat Germ Agglutinin coated PVT beads (organic scintillator, Amersham Pharmacia biotech) in a concentration of 0.4 mg and 40 \u03bcl of radiolabelled <sup>125</sup>J rheotaxin (Amersham, IM290) were incubated with 20 \u03bcl of the test compound (dissolved in DMSO dilutions) for 2 hours. The SPA incubation buffer contained 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>6\u00d7H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>2\u00d7H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Included were controls for specific binding (no displacer added) and non-specific binding by adding unlabelled rheotaxin (R&amp;D Systems) or a test compound. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counter (Micro Beta \u201cTrilux\u201d, Wallac).</p>Determination of affinity of test compounds (dissociation constant K<sub>i</sub>) was calculated by iterative fitting of experimental data using the law of mass action based program \u201ceasy sys\u201d (Schittkowski, Num Math 68, 129-142 (1994)).</p>The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of the migration of eosinophils or cell lines expressing the chemokine receptors may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the chemotaxis assay disclosed by Bacon et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol., 95, 966-974 (1988). In particular, the compound of the present invention have activity in inhibition of the migration of eosinophils in the aforementioned assays. As used herein, \u201cactivity\u201d is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an K<sub>i </sub>of 10 \u03bcM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.</p>Mammalian chemokine receptors provide a target for interfering with or promoting immune cell function in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds that inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function are particularly useful for modulating immune cell function for therapeutic purposes.</p>Accordingly, the present invention is directed to compounds which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, infection by pathogenic microbe"
