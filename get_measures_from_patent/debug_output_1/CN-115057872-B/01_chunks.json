    "549 cells, with significant selective inhibitory activity.</p>Test example 2 cell p-ERK assay</p>MIA PaCa2 is a Kras G12C mutant human pancreatic cancer cell strain, and is cultured in 10%FBS+2.5%Horse serum DMEM culture medium, cells in logarithmic phase are taken, cells in logarithmic phase are digested by enzyme EDTA, collected and counted, 2.5E4 cells are inoculated in a 96-well cell culture plate, and the cells are cultured overnight. Compound stock solution of 1000X was prepared 3.16-fold gradient using DMSO, diluted 200-fold to 5X compound stock solution using medium, and 5X compound stock solution was added to each cell culture well the next day after cell inoculation at a final concentration of 1X and DMSO content of 0.1%. DMSO was used as experimental control (control). After two hours of incubation with the compound, the residual medium was removed. 50ul cell lysis buffer were added to each well, incubated for 30 minutes, and 16ul of the mixture was transferred to a white bottom, impermeable 96 well plate, and 16ul cell lysis buffer was added to the blank well. After transfer, 4ul of p-ERK HTRF antibody mixture was added to each well, and after incubation for 4 hours, fluorescence was read. The inhibition ratio IR (%) = (RLU control-RLU compound)/(RLU control-RLU blank) \u00d7100% of the compound was calculated, and the compound gradient dilution concentration and the corresponding cell proliferation inhibition ratio were fitted using Prism 8 four-parameter method, and IC50 values were calculated. From the results, it can be seen that the exemplary compounds of the present invention have better inhibitory activity against the level of phosphorylated ERK downstream of the cell channel mutated by Kras G12C protein, with IC50 of less than 10 \u03bcm, or less than 1000nM, or less than 100nM. The results of the example compounds are shown in table 2 below.</p>Inhibitory Activity of the compounds of Table 2 on p-ERK</p></p></p>Test example 3 cell proliferation inhibition experiment</p>MIA PaCa-2 was a Kras G12C mutant human pancreatic cancer cell line, which was cultured in 10%FBS+2.5%Horse Serum DMEM medium, and A549 was a Kras G12S mutant human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, which was cultured in 10% FBS F-12K medium.
