{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* The N-desmethyl metabolite of STI571 is an active metabolite that is present in human plasma at concentrations from 30 to 50% of STI571 and the half-life is somewhat longer than that of STI571.\n* Specific drug marker substrate assays according to Tucker et al., Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 70, 103-114 (2001) can be used to determine the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of a compound of formula I for the principal drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes such as e.g. CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 and CP4A9/11.\n* Inhibition constants Ki or IC50 values derived by these in vitro assays provide a measure for the inhibition capacity of the tested drug compound according to the ratio of drug concentration in plasma to the respective inhibition constant Ki, where a ratio of >1.0 results in a high risk, 1.0-0.1 in a medium risk, and <0.1 in a low risk of metabolic drug interaction. \n\nNote that the third sentence does not contain a specific numeric value for the metric, but it does contain a range of values for the ratio of drug concentration to inhibition constant Ki. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that there are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. \n\nTherefore, the corrected output is:\n\n* None"}
