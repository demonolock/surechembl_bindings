    " EP 0 564 409 and, in the form of the methane sulfonate salt, in WO 99/03854. The N-desmethyl metabolite of STI571 is an active metabolite that is present in human plasma at concentrations from 30 to 50% of STI571 and the half-life is somewhat longer than that of STI571. Moreover, the N-desmethyl metabolite exhibits less inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (see following paragraph), when compared with STI571. Cytochromes P450 are the principal, hepatic xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and less inhibition of cytochromes P450 reduces the potential of a compound for clinical drug-drug interactions. Among the compounds of formula I, preference above all is therefore given for the N-desmethyl metabolite of STI571, namely N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-4-piperazin-1-ylmethyl-benzamide.</p>In order to evaluate the effect of the compounds of formula I on cytochromes P450 (CYPs), e.g. enzyme inhibition is routinely assessed by performing in vitro inhibition studies using cDNA-expressed enzymes or human liver microsomes (Parkinson, A., Toxicol. Pathol. 24, 45-57 [1996]). Specific drug marker substrate assays according to Tucker et al., Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 70, 103-114 (2001) can be used to determine the 50% inhibition concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of a compound of formula I for the principal drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes such as e.g. CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 and CP4A9/11.</p>Inhibition constants Ki or IC<sub>50 </sub>values derived by these in vitro assays provide a measure for the inhibition capacity of the tested drug compound according to the ratio of drug concentration in plasma to the respective inhibition constant Ki, where a ratio of &gt;1.0 results in a high risk, 1.0-0.1 in a medium risk, and &lt;0.1 in a low risk of metabolic drug interaction. Based on this, N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridine-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-4-piperazin-1-ylmethyl-benzamide possesses a much lower risk of drug-drug interactions with the 2 most important P450 enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5, in human drug metabolism (see guidance document of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) when compared with STI571.</p>Preference is given to compounds of formula I, wherein</p>R<sub>1 </sub>is unsubstituted or lower alkyl-substituted pyridyl bonded at a ring carbon atom and unsubstituted or substituted at the nitrogen atom by oxygen,</p>R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>are each independently of the other hydrogen or lower alkyl, one of the radicals R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>6</sub>, R<sub>7 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>is a radical of formula II, wherein</p>R<sub>9 </sub>is hydrogen or lower alkyl,</p>X is oxo, thio, imino, N-lower alkyl-imino, hydroximino or O-lower alkyl-hydroximino,</p>n is 0 and</p>R<sub>10 </sub>is phenyl which is</p>a) substituted by a radical selected from the group consisting of amino; mono- or di-lower alkylamino; lower alkanoylamino; formyl; lower alkoxy-carbonyl; and lower alkyl which is substituted by amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino or lower alkanoylamino, orb) substituted by an unsubstituted or substituted radical selected from the group consisting of benzylamino; benzoylamino; pyrrol"
