    "ytes. All experimental protocols were approved by the animal ethics committee of the Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Australia and the local animal ethics committee at the University of Freiburg. All procedures were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines.</p>An antibody specific for a peptide corresponding to Mac-1 I-domain sequence V160-S172 was obtained by immunizing mice with the peptide C-VMEQLKKSKTLFS-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:17) coupled to diphtheria toxoid (Monash Antibody Technologies Facility, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). Solid phase binding assays was employed to screen binding of sera to the immobilized peptide M7. Among different clones binding with high affinity to M7, the preferred clone RC3 (termed anti-M7) was further characterized.</p>Example 2A mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the CD40L binding site within human Mac-1, anti-M7, is effective in targeting the human integrin.</p>It has previously been shown that CD40L selectively binds to the EQLKKSKTL (SEQ ID NO:9) motif within the major Mac-1 ligand-binding domain. To obtain a specific inhibitor of the human binding site, mice were immunized with the human peptide V160-S172 containing the binding peptide M7. Interestingly, the M7 sequence was highly conserved between the human and murine protein sequence (Fig. 1A). Among several hybridoma clones with high-affinity binding of the according supernatant to the immobilized peptide M7 in a solid-phase binding assay, clone RC3 (mouse IgG2b\u03ba) showed specific inhibition of Mac-1-CD40L binding, but not of the interaction to other ligands. This antibody clone, subsequently termed anti-M7, bound to a CHO cell line over-expressing native (WT) and permanently activated Mac-1 (del), but not to control CHO cells in western blot (Fig. 1B), confirming successful binding to the target protein.</p>Moreover, anti-M7 bound to the immobilized peptides M7 (EQLKKSKTL) (SEQ ID NO:9), but not to the control peptides scrambled sM7 (KLSLEKQTK) (SEQ ID NO:12) or the peptide M8 (EEFRIHFT) (SEQ ID NO:13) in a solid phase binding (Fig. 1C), indicating that anti-M7 specifically binds to the immunized peptide. To test binding of anti-M7 to Mac-1 expressing human cells, we coupled the antibody with the fluorochrome Alexa647 and quantified binding to human leukocyte subsets in flow cytometry. Interestingly anti-M7 showed concentration-dependent binding to human leukocytes expressing Mac-1, such as monocytes and neutrophils, but not to lymphocytes as expected (Fig. 1 D). Binding of anti-Mac-1 clone M1/70 served as control and showed the same binding properties with highest binding to myeloid cells. These findings demonstrate that the binding sequence M7 within the human Mac-1 I-domain is accessible to binding with the monoclonal antibody anti-M7. Further DNA sequencing revealed CDRs and exact protein sequence of anti-M7 variable regions of heavy and light chain. This is shown in Table 1:\nTable 1: Protein"
