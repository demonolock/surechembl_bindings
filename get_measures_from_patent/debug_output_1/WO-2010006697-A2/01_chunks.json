    "bout 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water-soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxypropyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. A \n\n preferred HPMC is hypromellose 2910 15 mPa.s or hypromellose 2910 5mPa.s, especially hypromellose 2910 15 mPa.s. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is the United States Adopted Name for hypromellose (see Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th edition, page 1435). In the four digit number \"2910\", the first two digits represent the approximate percentage of methoxy groups and the third and fourth digits the approximate percentage composition of hydroxypropoxyl groups; 15 mPa.s or 5 mPa.s is a value indicative of the apparent viscosity of a 2 % aqueous solution at 20<sup>0</sup>C.</p>Copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate that may be used include those copolymers wherein the molecular ratio of the monomers vinylpyrrolidone to vinyl acetate is about 1.2 or wherein the mass ratio of the monomers vinylpyrrolidone to vinyl acetate is about 3 : 2. Such copolymers are commercially available and are known as copovidone or copolyvidone, sold under trademarks Kolima\u2122 or Kollidon VA 64\u2122. The molecular weight of these polymers may be in the range of about 45 to about 70 kD. The K- value, obtained from viscosity measurements may be in the range of about 25 to about 35, in particular the K value may be about 28.</p>Polyvinylpyrrolidine polymers that may be used are known as povidone (PVP) and are commercially available. They may have a molecular weight that is in the range of about 30 kD to about 360 kD. Examples are PVP K12 (BASF, MW 2000-3000), PVP K17 (BASF, MW=7000-l 1000) PVP K25 (BASF, MW=28000-34000), PVP K30 (BASF, MW=44000-54000), and PVP K90 (BASF, MW=1000000-1500000), available under the tradename Kollidon\u2122.</p>The active ingredient TMC 125 may be used as such, i.e. as the base form, but may also be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salt form. The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic salt forms. The acid addition salt forms can be obtained by treating the base form with appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy- 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2- hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Of interest are the hydrohalic acid salts, in particular the hydrobromic acid salt. \n\n The TMC 125 in the dosage forms of the invention is present in the form of a solid dispersion in a water-soluble polymer. Different types of solid dispersions exist. One type of solid dispersion is where the pharmaceutical agent is molecularly dispersed, substantially homogeneously, throughout the polymer."
