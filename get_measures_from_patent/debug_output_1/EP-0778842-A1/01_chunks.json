    "m a bank or library of agents, candidate agents which modulate telomerase activity by modulating the non-covalent binding of a mammalian telomerase RNA component with a telomerase protein component. The telomerase RNA component can be produced from a recombinant template in a host cell or chemically synthesized, if desired. Typically, a mammalian telomerase protein component, such as may be purified from telomerase-expressing cells, and which may have a naturally occurring telomerase RNA component removed (e.g., by RNAse treatment) , is contacted with a mammalian telomerase RNA component under suitable aqueous binding conditions to permit non-covalent binding between the RNA and protein components in the absence of an added agent (i.e., in a control binding reaction) . The magnitude of noncovalent interaction between the telomerase RNA component and protein component in the presence of one or more agents selected from a library or bank of agents is compared to the magnitude of noncovalent interaction in a control binding reaction comprising telomerase RNA and protein components and lacking the agent(s); agents which produce a statistically significant increase in the magnitude of noncovalent binding between the telomerase RNA and protein components is thereby determined as a candidate telomerase modulating agent. The relative magnitude of noncovalent binding can be determined by any suitable method, including determination of specific binding affinity, such as by competitive binding assay, determination of telomerase catalytic activity on a suitable telomere repeat template, or other suitable assay of functional noncovalent interaction between the RNA and protein components of mammalian telomerase, such as a gel shift or EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) .</p>In an embodiment of a noncovalent binding assay for detecting candidate telomerase modulating agents, one or both \n\nof the telomerase RNA component or protein component are labeled with a suitable detectable label and noncovalent binding is separately determined in the presence and absence of an agent selected from a library or bank of agents. The determination of noncovalent binding comprises measuring the extent to which a labeled telomerase component (RNA component or protein component) is bound to its cognate telomerase component (protein component or RNA component, respectively) , whether said cognate telomerase component is separately labeled or is unlabeled, such as by capturing (e.g., immobilizing) bound complexes comprising said labeled telomerase component and said cognate telomerase component, and separating (e.g., by washing) unbound labeled telomerase component from a said bound complexes thereby generating a separated bound fraction and detecting the bound complexes in the separated bound fraction by determining the presence of detectable label. Agents which produce a statistically significant reduction or enhancement of noncovalent binding of telomerase RNA and protein components are thereby identified as candidate telomerase modulating agents. Agents which reduce noncovalent binding are candidate telomerase inhibitors (or antagonists) , whereas agents which enhance noncovalent binding of telomerase components are candidate telomerase agonists. In an embodiment, candidate telomerase modulating "
