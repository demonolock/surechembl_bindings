    "bjected to immunofluorescence analysis. Anti-Myelin Basic Protein monoclonal antibody (a.a. 129-138, clone 1 monoclonal antibody, Millipore) (1:1000 dilution) in blocking buffere solution (3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) was added to fixed and washed cells and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The primary antibody solution was removed and cells were washed with PBS prior to incubation with a blocking buffer solution containing goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) and DAPI (2 ug/mL) for 1 hr at 25\u00b0 C. The secondary antibody solution was washed with PBS and plates were imaged using an OPERA high content screening system (Perkin Elmer). A cell scoring based image analysis algorithm was used to identify and score MBP positive cells. Hits were identified as compounds that induced &gt;400 cells/field and &gt;5% MBP positive cells/field. The average values for DMSO negative controls were consistently &lt;0.5% MBP positive. A total of 6058 compounds comprised of commercially available small molecule screening collections (LOPAC, Tocris, Enzo) were screened. A total of 104 primary hits were identified. These consisted of a number of known OPC differentiating inducing agents (e.g., retenoids, sterols, nucleoside analogues, Rho kinase inhibitors), as well as a number of previously unidentified OPC differentiation inducing agents (e.g., neurotransmitter modulating agents).</p>Identified primary hits were subsequently evaluated by determining EC50 values in multiple replicate experiments using the primary assay format for determining OPC differentiation. Cells were treated with compounds serially diluted in DMSO (10 dilutions of 1:3 across a range of 71 \u03bcM to 4 nM). Staining and imaging was performed as described for the primary screen. EC<sub>50 </sub>values were determined using appropriate curve fitting equations in Graphpad Prism 5.0. FIG. 1A shows the EC50 for six identified hits (carbetapentane, clemastine, benztropine, trifluoperazine, salmeterol, and GBR12935), all of which are FDA-approved blood-brain barrier-penetrating drugs. FIG. 1 also shows the ability of these six identified hits to induce differentiation of OPCs (as measured by the percentage of myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive cells) at varying concentrations (FIG. 1B). For each of these agents, when the OPC sample was cultured with an agent at maximum potency, the percentage of resulting MBP-positive cells was at least 10% (FIG. 1C). For GBT12935, the percentage of resulting MBP-positive cells was over 15%. These results show that carbetapentane, clemastine, benztropine, trifluoperazine, salmeterol, and GBR12935 all promote OPC differentiation.</p>Example 2Validation of Hits from Small Molecule ScreenSeveral classes of neurotransmitter receptor modulating agents that were identified by the primary screen were selected based on FDA approval status, known toxicity, and brain pharmacokinetics for evaluation in subsequent in vitro and in vivo validation assays. The ability of compounds to induce robust differentiation of OPCs to a fully mature myelinating oligodendrocyte cell fate was evaluated in vitro using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis techniques. The ability of compounds to induce remyelination in vivo (in the presence of inflammatory insult) was evaluated using a proteolipid protein (PLP) induced Experimental Autoimm"
