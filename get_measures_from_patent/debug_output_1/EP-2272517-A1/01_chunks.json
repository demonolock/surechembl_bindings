    "s of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.</p>Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.</p>The compounds of the inventions will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain from 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient, more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example, 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams.</p>The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.</p>Protein Kinase Inhibitory ActivityThe activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of protein kinase A and protein kinase B can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC50 value. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC<sub>50</sub> value of less than 1 \u00b5M, more preferably less than 0.1 \u00b5M, against protein kinase B.</p>Some of the compounds of the formula (I) are selective inhibitors of PKB relative to PKA, i.e. the IC<sub>50</sub> values against PKB are from 5 to 10 times lower, and more preferably greater than 10 times lower, than the IC<sub>50</sub> values against PKA.</p>Therapeutic UsesPrevention or Treatment of Proliferative DisordersThe compounds of the formula (I) are inhibitors of protein kinase A and protein kinase B. As such, they are expected to be useful in providing a means of preventing the growth of or inducing apoptosis of neoplasias. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. In particular tumours with deletions or inactivating mutations in PTEN or loss of PTEN expression or rearrangements in the (T-cell lytmphocyte) TCL-1 gene may be particularly sensitive to PKB inhibitors. Tumours which have other abnormalities leading to an upregulated PKB pathway signal may also be particularly sensitive to inhibitors of PKB. Examples of such abnormalities include but are not limited to overexpression of one or more PI3K subunits, over-expression of one or more PKB isoforms, or mutations in PI3K, PDK1, or PKB which lead to an increase in the basal activity of the enzyme in question, or upregulation or overexpression"
