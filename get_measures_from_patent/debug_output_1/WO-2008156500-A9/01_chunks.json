    " alignment-was accomplished with NALIGN, (both PCGENE and Omiga 1.0; Intelligenetics). Over-lapping sequences constituted nearly the entire 717 base-pair region (Example 17) with 100% homology. Joining of the aligned sequences was accomplished with SEQIN. EXAMPLE 23: Construction of LIM Protein Expression Vector</p>The construction of pHIS-5ATG LMP-Is expression vector was carried out with the sequences described in Examples 17 and 18. The 717 base-pair clone (Example 17; SEQ. ID NO: 7) was digested with CIaI and EcoRV. A small fragment (-250 base-pairs) was gel purified. Clone 7 (Example 18; SEQ. ID NO: 8) was digested with CIaI and Xbal and a 1400 base-pair fragment was gel purified. The isolated 250 base-pair and 1400 base-pair restriction fragments were ligated to form a fragment of -1650 base-pairs. Due to the single nucleotide substitution in Clone 7 (relative to the 717 base-pair PCR sequence and the original rat sequence) a stop codon at translated base-pair 672 resulted. Because of this stop codon, a truncated (short) protein was encoded, hence the name LMP- Is. This was the construct used in the expression vector (SEQ. ID NO: 32). The full length cDNA sequence with 5' UTR (SEQ. ID NO: 33) was created by alignment of SEQ. ID NO: 32 with the 5' RACE sequence (SEQ. ID NO: 21). The amino acid sequence of LMP-Is (SEQ. ID NO: 34) was then deduced as a 223 amino acid protein and confirmed by Western blot (as in Example 15) to run at the predicted molecular weight of- 23.7 kD. The pHis-ATG vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was digested with EcoRV and Xbal. The vector was recovered and the 650 base-pair restriction fragment ent was then hgated into the linearized pHis-ATG. The ligated product was cloned and amplified. The pHis- ATG-LMP-Is Expression vector, also designated pHIS-A with insert HLMP-Is, was purified by standard methods. EXAMPLE 24: Induction of Bone Nodule Formation and Mineralization In vitro with LMP Expression Vector</p>Rat Calvarial cells were isolated and grown in secondary culture according to Example 1. Cultures were either unstimulated or stimulated with glucocorticoid (GC) as described in Example 1. A modification of the Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) transfection protocol was used to trans feet 3 , \u03bcg/well of each vector into secondary rat calvarial osteoblast cultures according to Example 25. \n\n Mineralized nodules were visualized by Von Kossa staining, as described in Example 3. Human LMP-Is gene product over expression alone induced bone nodule formation (~ 203 nodules/well) in vitro. Levels of nodules were approximately 50% of those induced by the GC positive control (- 412 nodules/well). Other positive controls included the pHisA-LMP-Rat expression vector (~ 152 nodules/well) and the pCMV2/LMP-Rat-Fwd Expression vector (-206 nodules/well), whereas the negative controls included the pCMV2/LMP-Rat-Rev. expression vector (~ 2 nodules/well) and untreated (NT) plates (~ 4 nodules/well).
