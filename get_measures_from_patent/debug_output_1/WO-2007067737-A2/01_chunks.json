    " IFITl, which has been shown to be upregulated in a variety of viral infections including Hepatitis C (HCV) as well as in HIV infection of astrocytes. While the biological function \n\n of IFITl is unknown, it has been reported to be able to interact with Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and thus may help in the activation of Rho proteins. The idea that HIV may use an interferon-induced protein to help facilitate its replication is intriguing and worth further study. The other two genes with dual activity, the chaperone protein DnaJC14 and PITPN\u03b1 which is a lipid transport protein involved in vesicle trafficking, also promise to yield further insight into virus biology. </p> [0086] Because of its clear physiologic role and high potential as a therapeutic target, we next focused our efforts on the strong cDNA enhancer mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). This serine/threonine kinase is involved in the activation of downstream Map kinases, including JNK, p38, and ERK, and has been shown to play a critical role in neuronal apoptosis including that mediated by HIV gpl20. A compound inhibitor of MLK3, CEP- 1347, was in clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its role in neuronal cell death and its applicability as a drug target (Bodner et al, Experimental Neurology 188:246-53, 2004). To address whether the kinase activity of MLK3 was responsible for the enhancement of infection seen using the cDNA, we obtained a kinase-inactive mutant (MLK3 KI) and tested its effects on HIV infection. Unlike the wild type protein, MLK3 KI was unable to increase infection, suggesting that the function of MLK3 is critical for enhancement (Fig. 1). Because of its role in activating the AP-I complex through JNK activation, we hypothesized that MLK3 could be acting by enhancing HIV transcription via the AP-I site located in the HIV LTR. To test this, MLK3 was co-transfected with the LTR-luciferase construct either with a Tat expression vector or a control plasmid to assess both Tat-dependent and Tat-independent effects on LTR-mediated transcription. Expression of MLK3 enhanced Tat-dependent transcription by approximately 3-fold over control but had no significant effect on Tat-independent transcription (Fig. 2), suggesting that MLK3 enhances infection through viral specific transcription. </p> [0087] Considering the overexpression data, we finally investigated whether siRNA against MLK3 would inhibit HIV infection. We obtained three unique siRNA sequences targeting MLK3 and evaluated their efficacy against HIV in HeLa-CD4-\u03b2gal cells or Jurkat cells. Individual MLK3 siRNAs were transfected into HeLaCD4\u03b2gal cells or electroporated into Jurkat cells. After 24 hours, the cells were challenged with HIV- \n\n HIb. For HeLaCD4\u03b2gal cells, infection was assessed after 3 additional days by measuring the beta-galactosidase produced from the stable LTR-\u03b2gal reporter within the cells using a chemiluminescent substrate (Gal Screen). For Jurkat cells, input virus was removed 24 hours after infection, and supernatants were collec"
