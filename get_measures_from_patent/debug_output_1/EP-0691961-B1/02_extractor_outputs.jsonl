{"raw_mentions": "A compound is considered to be active if it has an IC50 or Ki value of less than 1 mM for the inhibition of HIV protease or HIV viral growth or infectivity. \nValues of Ki for inhibitor binding were determined from percent activity measurements in the presence and absence of known concentration of inhibitor, using a value of 0.07 mM for the Km of the substrate (Cheng et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 9660). \nThe Ki was calculated from the formula Ki = I/(((Km+S-FA*S)/(FA*Km))-1) where I = inhibitory concentration, S = substrate concentration, FA = fractional activity = cm peak height with inhibitor/cm peak height without inhibitor, and Km = Michaelis constant = 20 \u00b5M. \nProtease was stored as a stock preparation at 10 uM in refolding buffer. \nEnzyme reaction: In a 2 ml screw-cap centrifuge tube were added 50 \u00b5l protease (final concentration 0.25 nM) and 100 \u00b5l inhibitory compound (final concentration 0.1-12,500). \nStock solutions of 10 mM were prepared in DMSO. \nStock solutions of 2 mM substrate were prepared in DMSO. \nInhibitory compounds were dissolved in sufficient DMSO to make 3 mM stock solutions. \nInhibitory compounds were dissolved in sufficient DMSO to make 2.5 or 25 mM stock solutions. \nThe reaction was started with the addition of 50 \u00b5l substrate (final concentration 5 \u00b5M). \nThe mobile phases were pumped at 1 ml/min, with a gradient from 0 to 30% B in 5 min, 100 % B for 4 min to wash the column, and a re-equilibration for 4 min. \nThe retention time of the product was 3.6 min. \nDetection with a Shimadzu model RF535 fluorescence monitor was at 330 nm (excitation) and 430 (emission)."}
