The protease inhibitory\nactivity of the compounds of the present invention is\ndemonstrated using standard assays of protease activity,\nfor example, using the assay described below for\nassaying inhibitors of HIV protease activity. The\nability of the compounds of the present invention to\ninhibit viral growth or infectivity is demonstrated in\nstandard assay of viral growth or infectivity, for\nexample, using the assays described below.</p>\n  A compound is considered to be active if it has an\nIC<sub>50</sub> or Ki value of less than 1 mM for the\ninhibition of HIV protease or HIV viral growth or\ninfectivity.</p>\n  HIV Protease Inhibition Assay- Spectroscopic Method\n  Materials :\n  Protease: Inclusion bodies of E. coli harboring\nplasmid containing HIV protease under the control of an\ninducible T7 promoter were prepared according to Cheng\net. al (1990) Gene 87: 243. Inclusion bodies were\nsolubilized in 8 M urea, 50 mM tris pH 8.0. Protease\nactivity was recovered by dilution 20-fold into buffer\ncontaining 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10%\nglycerol and 5% ethylene glycol. Enzyme was used at a\nfinal concentration of 1.0-10 ug/ml (ug = microgram).</p>\n  Substrate: Peptide of sequence: Ala-Thr-His-Gln-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO<sub>2</sub>)-Val-Arg-Lys-Ala,\ncontaining\npara-nitrophenylalanine (Phe(NO<sub>2</sub>)), was prepared by\nsolid phase peptide synthesis as previously described by\nCheng et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 9660.\nStock solutions of 10 mM were prepared in DMSO.</p>\n  Inhibitory compounds were dissolved in sufficient\nDMSO to make 2.5 or 25 mM stock solutions. All further\ndilutions were done in DMSO.</p>\n  \n    Reactions :\n  \n  Compound (1-5 \u00b5l) and HIV\nprotease were mixed in buffer containing 50 mM MES, pH\n6.5, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10%\nglycerol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of\npeptide substrate to a final concentration of 240 \u00b5M\nand absorbance at 300nm monitored for 10\nmin. Values of Ki for inhibitor binding were\ndetermined from percent activity measurements in the\npresence and absence of known concentration of\ninhibitor, using a value of 0.07 mM for the Km of the\nsubstrate (Cheng et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.\nUSA 87: 9660).</p>\n  The HIV-1 protease inhibitory activity of\nrepresentative compounds of the invention is shown in\nTable 2 (below). </p>\n  \n    HIV Protease Inhibition Assay- HPLC Method\n  \n  \n    Materials:\n  \n  Protease: Inclusion bodies of E. coli harboring\nplasmid containing plasmid T1718R with a synthetic gene\ncoding for a single-chain tethered dimer of HIV protease\nwere prepared as described in Cheng et al. (Proc. Natl.\nAcad. Sci. USA, 87, 9660-9664, 1990). Active protease\nwas prepared as described therein by extraction with 67%\nacetic acid, dilution 33-fold with water, dialysis\nagainst water and then against a \"refolding buffer\"\nconsisting of 20 mM MES, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 10%\nglycerol. Protease was stored as a stock preparation at\n10 uM in refolding buffer.</p>\n  Substrate: Peptide of sequence: aminobenzoyl-Ala-Thr-His-Gln-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO<sub>2</sub>)-Val-Arg-Lys-Ala\ncontaining\np-nitrophenylalanine, was prepared by solid phase\nsynthesis as previously described Cheng et al., op.cit.\nStock solutions of 2 mM substrate were prepared in DMSO.</p>\n  Inhibitory compounds were dissolved in sufficient\nDMSO to make 3 mM stock solutions. All further dilutions\nwere prepared in \"assay buffer\": 1 M NaCl, 50 mM MES, pH\n5.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 20% glycerol.</p>\n  \n    Reactions:\n  \n  Enzyme reaction: In a 2 ml screw-cap centrifuge\ntube were added 50 \u00b5l protease (final concentration 0.25\nnM) and 100 \u00b5l inhibitory compound (final concentration\n0.1-12,500). After 15 min preincubation at room\ntemperature, the reaction was started with the addition\nof 50 \u00b5l substrate (final concentration 5 \u00b5M).\nIncubation was carried out at 30\u00b0 C for 1 h. The\nreaction was stopped with 1 ml 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide. </p>\n  HPLC measurement of product formation: The product\n(aminobenzoyl-Ala-Thr-His-Gln-Val-Tyr) was separated\nfrom substrate on a Pharmacia MonoQ anion exchange\ncolumn. The injection volume was 200 \u00b5l. The mobile\nphases were: A (20 mM trisHCl, pH 9.0, 0.02% sodium\nazide, 10% acetonitrile), B (20 mM tris HCl, pH 9.0,\n0.02% sodium azide, 0.5 M ammonium formate, 10%\nacetonitrile). The mobile phases were pumped at 1\nml/min, with a gradient from 0 to 30% B in 5 min, 100 %\nB for 4 min to wash the column, and a re-equilibration\nfor 4 min. The retention time of the product was 3.6\nmin. Detection with a Shimadzu model RF535 fluorescence\nmonitor was at 330 nm (excitation) and 430 (emission).\nThe Ki was calculated from the formula Ki = I/(((Km+S-FA*S)/(FA*Km))-1)\nwhere I = inhibitory concentration, S\n= substrate concentration, FA = fractional activity = cm\npeak height with inhibitor/cm peak height without\ninhibitor, and Km = Michaelis constant = 20 \u00b5M.</p>\n  \n    HIV Yield Reduction Cell Assay\n  \n  Materials: MT-2, a human T-cell line, was cultured\nin RPMI medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat\ninactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), L-glutamine and\ngentamycin. Human immunodeficiency virus strains, HIV\n(3B) and HIV(RF) were propagated in H-9 cells in RPMI\nwith 5% FCS. Poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated cell culture\nplates were prepared according to the method of Harada\net al. (1985) Science 229: 563-566. MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide,\nwas obtained from Sigma.</p>\n  Method: Test compounds were dissolved in\ndimethylsulfoxide to 5 mg/ml and serially diluted into\nRPMI medium to ten times the desired final\nconcentration. MT-2 cells (5 x 10<sup>5</sup>/ml) in 2.3 ml were\nmixed with 0.3 ml of the appropriate test compound \nsolution and allowed to sit for 30 minutes at room\ntemperature. HIV (3B) or HIV (RF) (~5 x 10<sup>5</sup> plaque\nforming units/ml) in 0.375 ml was added to the cell and\ncompound mixtures and incubated for one hour at 36\u00b0C.\nThe mixtures were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes\nand the supernatants containing unattached virus were\ndiscarded. The cell pellets were suspended in fresh RPMI\ncontaining the appropriate concentrations of test\ncompound and placed in a 36\u00b0",
    "MT-2 cells (5 x 10<sup>4</sup>/0.1 ml) were added to each well of a\n96 well culture plate and 0.02 ml of the appropriate\ntest compound solution was added to the cells such that\neach compound concentration was present in two wells.\nThe cells and compounds were allowed to sit for 30\nminutes at room temperature. HIV(3B) or HIV(RF) (\u223c5 x\n10<sup>5</sup> plaque forming units/ml) was diluted in medium and\nadded to the cell and compound mixtures to give a\nmultiplicity of infection of 0.01 plaque forming\nunit/cell. The mixtures were incubated for 7 days at\n36\u00b0C, during which time the virus replicated and caused\nthe death of unprotected cells. The percentage of cells\nprotected from virus induced cell death was determined\nby the degree of metabolism of the tetrazolium dye, XTT.\nIn living cells, XTT was metabolized to a colored\nformazan product which was quantitated\nspectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The amount of colored\nformazan was proportional to the number of cells\nprotected from virus by the test compound. The\nconcentration of compound protecting either 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) \nor 90% (IC<sub>90</sub>) with respect to an uninfected cell culture\nwas determined.</p>\n  The HIV inhibitory activity of representative\ncompounds of the present invention in the whole cell\ninfectivity assay described above is shown in Table 2.\nExample NumberK<sub>i</sub>IC<sub>90</sub>1++++++24+++++</p>\n  The IC<sub>90</sub> values in Table 2 are indicated as: +++ =\n&lt;10 \u00b5g/ml.</p>\n  In the Tables herein the Ki values were determined\nusing the assay conditions described above under HIV\nProtease Inhibition Assay-HPLC Method. The Ki values\nare indicated as follows: +++ = &lt;10 nM; ++ = 10 nM to 1\n\u00b5M; + = &gt;1 \u00b5M.</p>\n  In the Tables herein the IC<sub>90</sub> values were\ndetermined using the assay conditions described above\nunder HIV Low Multiplicity Assay. The IC<sub>90</sub> values are\nindicated as follows: +++ = &lt;10 \u00b5g/ml; ++ = 10 to 100\n\u00b5g/ml; + = &gt;100 \u00b5g/ml.</p>\n  \n    Dosage and Formulation\n  \n  The antiviral compounds of this invention can be\nadministered as treatment for viral infections by any \nmeans that produces contact of the active agent with the\nagent's site of action, the viral protease, in the body\nof a mammal. They can be administered by any\nconventional means available for use in conjunction with\npharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents\nor in a combination of therapeutic agents. They can be\nadministered alone, but generally administered with a\npharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the\nchosen route of administration and standard\npharmaceutical practice.</p>\n  The dosage administered will, of course, vary\ndepending upon known factors, such as the\npharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent\nand its mode and route of administration; the age,\nhealth and weight of the recipient; the nature and\nextent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent\ntreatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect\ndesired. A daily dosage of active ingredient can be\nexpected to be 0.001 to 1000 milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight, with the preferred dose being\n0.1"
