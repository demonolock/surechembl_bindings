    " response to therapy with the anti-HER-2-humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.) in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer (Arteaga et al. 2002; Ross et al., 2004). Inhibition of PI3K/Akt is required for the antitumor effect of HER2 inhibitors (Arteaga et al. 2002; Shin et al., 2002). HER2 overexpression, detected by IHC and/or FISH, is the biomarker predictive of good odds of response to treatment with the antibody. However, one of the major clinical problems encountered with trastuzumab treatment is that metastatic breast cancer patients, who initially responded to trastuzumab, demonstrated disease progression within one year of treatment initiation (Nahta et al., 2006). Preclinical studies have indicated that increased signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway may contribute to trastuzumab resistance (Nahta et al., 2006).</p>Considerable interest has been shown in the 17q12 amplicon as one of the most frequently amplified regions in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and breast cancer (Kauraniemi et al., 2003; Varis et al., 2002). Analysis of this amplicon's structure revealed an approximate 280-kb common region of amplification that contains 10 transcribed sequences (Kauraniemi et al., 2003; Varis et al., 2002; Kauraniemi and Kallioniemi, 2006; Maqani et al., 2006). Cloning and physical mapping strategies of transcripts in this region have shown that DARPP-32 (Dopamine and cyclic AMP regulated phosphoprotein 32 kD) and its truncated variant (t-DARPP) are located next to ErbB2 within the same amplicon structure (Varis et al., 2002; Maqani et al., 2006; Varis et al., 2004). Interestingly, DARPP-32 and t-DARPP are frequently amplified and over-expressed in a number of adenocarcinomas that include breast, gastric, esophageal, colon, and prostate (El-Rifai et al., 2002; Beckler et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2004). Recent studies have shown that t-DARPP is a potent anti-apoptotic protein that counteracts drug-induced apoptosis (Belkhiri et al., 2005).</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThus, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of improving the effect of an anti-HER2/Neu therapy in a subject comprising administering to the subject an inhibitor of t-DARPP activity. The inhibitor of t-DARPP activity may inhibit t-DARPP mRNA synthesis or stability, or t-DARPP protein translation, such as an antisense nucleic acid, an siRNA, or an shRNA. Alternatively, the inhibitor of t-DARPP activity may inhibit the function of t-DARPP gene product, such as an antibody, a peptide or a small molecule that binds to t-DARPP. The anti-HER2/Neu therapy may be an anti-HER2/Neu antibody administration. The anti-HER2/Neu therapy may comprise a reduced dose as compared to an effective dose for the anti-HER2/Neu therapy provided in the absence of the inhibitor of t-DARPP activity. Either or both of the anti-HER2/Neu therapy and the inhibitor of t-DARPP activity may be administered to the subje"
