Additionally, these oncogenic forms of Ras have been found to exhibit a greatly diminished sensitivity to the ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) (Trahey and McCormick, Science, 242:1697-1700 (1987); Vogel et al., Nature, 335:90-03 (1988)). These findings suggest that the GTP-bound state of Ras represents an activated, signal-emitting form of Ras which is normally inactivated through GTP hydrolysis, yielding an inactive GDP-bound form of the protein. Because of their reduced intrinsic GTPase activity and resistance to GAP, oncogenic forms of Ras may be trapped in this activated state for extended periods of time, thereby flooding the cell with growth-stimulatory signals.</p>In part because Ras has no other apparent catalytic activities associated with it, it is hypothesized that Ras acts as a regulatory subunit of another protein that serves as its effector, releasing mitogenic signals when prompted to do so by activated, GTP-bound Ras. One candidate for such an effector protein is GAP itself. However, GAP has no obvious catalytic domains that might play a role in metabolic processes associated with cell proliferation. For this reason, GAP itself might act as a signal transducer which passes Ras-initiated signals on to bona fide effectors still further downstream in the signaling cascade.</p>The NF1 mRNA is &gt;12 kb in size, and encodes a 320 kd protein, neurofibromin. A 360 amino acid segment near the middle of the protein sequence shows 30% homology to the catalytic domain of the GTPase activating protein (GAP) and the yeast IRA1 and IRA2 proteins that stimulate GTPase activity of Ras proteins. The GAP-related domain of neurofibromin exhibits GAP activity toward human and yeast Ras proteins and complements the loss of function in yeast IRA mutants. Numerous studies have confirmed the GAP activity of full-length neurofibromin as well as the GAP-related domain. Loss of neurofibromin through mutations at the NF1 locus are predicted to cause a failure to terminate Ras signals, and to cause alterations in growth and differentiation of affected cells.</p>It has been shown that neurofibrosarcoma (malignant Schwann cell) cell lines contain little neurofibromin, and at the same time show increased levels of GTP bound to Ras, suggesting a correlation between loss of neurofibromin and Ras regulation in such cells (deClue et al., Cell, 69:265-273 (1992)). These data suggest that neurofibromin is the major regulator of Ras in malignant Schwann cells, in spite of the fact that these cells contain normal levels of p120 GAP protein. Decreasing levels of Ras-GTP in the neurofibrosarcoma cells by overexpressing p120 GAP led to reduced frequency of colony formation and decreased growth in agar, suggesting that Ras-GTP contributes to some of the transformed properties of these malignant Schwann cells.</p>Recently mice containing ta"
