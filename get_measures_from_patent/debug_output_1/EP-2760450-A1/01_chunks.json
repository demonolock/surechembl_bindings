Substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate (4MU-B; Sigma) and either purified mutant MGL (mut-MGLL 11-313 L179S L186S) or purified wild type MGL (wt-MGLL 6H- 11-313) were diluted separately into 20 mM PIPES buffer (pH = 7.0), containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.001% Tween 20. Compounds of formula (I) were pre-dispensed (50 nL) into the microplate using a liquid handling dispenser prior to adding 4MU-B (25 \u03bc\u0395 of 1.2X solution to a final concentration of 10 \u03bc\u039c) followed by enzyme (5 \u03bc\u0395 of a 6X solution to a final concentration of 5 nM) to initiate the reaction. Final compound concentrations ranged from 17 to 0.0003 \u03bc\u039c. The fluorescence change due to 4MU-B cleavage was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 335 and 440 nm, respectively, and a bandwidth of 10 nm (Safire<sup>2</sup>, Tecan) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. </p> The IC50 values for compounds of formula (I) were determined using a spreadsheet, i.e., Excel\u00ae from Microsoft, from a fit of the equation to the </p>concentration-response plot of the fractional activity as a function of inhibitor concentration. \n\n Biological Data Table 1 \n\n </p>Example 2 </p> 2-AG Accumulation assay </p> To measure the accumulation of 2-AG due to inhibition of MGL, one g rat brain was homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, PT300) in 10 mL of 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4), containing 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM KC1 and 20 mM glucose. Compounds of formula (I) (10 \u03bc\u039c) were pre-incubated with rat brain homogenate (50 mg). After a 15-min incubation time at 37\u00b0C, CaCL. (final concentration = 10 mM) was added and then incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 5 mL. The reactions were stopped with 6 mL organic solvent extraction solution of 2: 1 chloroform/methanol. Accumulated 2-AG in the organic phase was measured by a HPLC/MS method, according to the following equation: </p> percent vehicle = (2-AG accumulation in the presence of compound/2-AG accumulation in vehicle) x 100. </p> Biological Data Table 2 </p></p>Example 3 </p> MGL ThermoFluor<sup>\u00ae</sup> Assay - mutant </p> The ThermoFluor (TF) assay is a 384-well microplate-based binding assay that measures thermal stability of proteins<sup>1</sup>'<sup>2</sup>. The experiments were carried out using ThermoFluor instruments available from Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development, LLC. TF dye used in all experiments was 1,8-ANS (Invitrogen: A- \n\n47). Final TF assay conditions used for MGL studies were 0.07 mg/ml of mutant MGL, 100 \u03bc\u039c ANS, 200 mM NaCl, 0.001% Tween-20 in 50 mM PIPES (pH = 7.0). </p> Screening compound plates contained 100% DMSO compound solutions at a single concentration. For follow-up concentration-response studies, compounds were arranged in a pre-dispensed plate (Greiner Bio-one: 781280), wherein compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO across 11 columns within a series. Columns 12 and 24 were used as DMSO reference and contained no compound. For both single and multiple compound concentration-repsonse experiments, the compound aliquots (46 nL) were robotically predispensed directly into 384-well black microplates (Abgene: TF-0384/k) using the Hummingbird liquid handler. Following compound dispension, protein and dye solutions were added to achieve the final assay volume of 3 \u03bc\u03af. The assay solutions were overlayed with 1 \u03bc\u0390<sub>^</sub> of silicone oil (Fluka, type DC 200: 85411) to prevent evaporation. </p> Bar-coded microplates were robotically loaded onto a thermostatically controlled PCR-type thermal block and then heated from 40 to 90 \u00b0C degrees at a ramp- rate of 1 \u00b0C/min for all experiments.
