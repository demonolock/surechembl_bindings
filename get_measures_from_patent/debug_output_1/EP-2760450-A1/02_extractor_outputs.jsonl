{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) were pre-dispensed (50 nL) into the microplate using a liquid handling dispenser prior to adding 4MU-B (25 \u03bc\u0395 of 1.2X solution to a final concentration of 10 \u03bc\u039c) followed by enzyme (5 \u03bc\u0395 of a 6X solution to a final concentration of 5 nM) to initiate the reaction. \nThe IC50 values for compounds of formula (I) were determined using a spreadsheet, i.e., Excel\u00ae from Microsoft, from a fit of the equation to the concentration-response plot of the fractional activity as a function of inhibitor concentration. \nCompounds of formula (I) (10 \u03bc\u039c) were pre-incubated with rat brain homogenate (50 mg). \nFinal TF assay conditions used for MGL studies were 0.07 mg/ml of mutant MGL, 100 \u03bc\u039c ANS, 200 mM NaCl, 0.001% Tween-20 in 50 mM PIPES (pH = 7.0). \nFor follow-up concentration-response studies, compounds were arranged in a pre-dispensed plate (Greiner Bio-one: 781280), wherein compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO across 11 columns within a series. \nColumns 12 and 24 were used as DMSO reference and contained no compound. \nThe assay solutions were overlayed with 1 \u03bc\u0390<sub>^</sub> of silicone oil (Fluka, type DC 200: 85411) to prevent evaporation. \nFinal compound concentrations ranged from 17 to 0.0003 \u03bc\u039c."}
