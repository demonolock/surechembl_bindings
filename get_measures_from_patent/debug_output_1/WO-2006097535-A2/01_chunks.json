    "nventional meaning. Unless indicated explicitly, the amino acids mentioned herein are L-amino acids. Further, the left and right ends of an amino acid sequence of a peptide are, respectively, the N- and C-termini unless otherwise specified.</p>The present invention is further illustrated by the following example which, however, is not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection. The features disclosed in the foregoing description and in the following example may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.</p>The following abbreviations are used: amu: atomic mass units.</p>DIPEA: diisopropylethylamine. DMF: N,N-Dimethylformamide.</p>HBTU: 2-(1 H-Benzotriazole-1 -yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro phosphate.</p>HOAt: N-hydroxy-9-azabenzotriazole.</p>HPLC: High Performance Liquid Chromatography.</p>NMP: N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone. PyBop: Benzotriazol-1 -yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate</p>TFA: Trifluoroacetic acid.</p>THF: Tetrahydrofuran.</p>TES: Triethylsilane</p>The compounds of the present can be synthesized by those skilled in the art using standard coupling and deprotection steps. A description of all necessary tools and synthetic methods can be found in \"The Fine Art Of Solid Phase Synthesis\", 2002/3 Catalog, Novabiochem. A typical example that include a cyclization step is as follows:</p>Radioligand binding to plasma membranes expressing the human GLP-1 receptor \n\n The binding assay was performed with purified plasma membranes containing the human GLP-1 receptor. The plasma membranes containing the receptors were purified from stably expressing BHK tk-ts 13 cells. The membranes were diluted in Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.005% Tween 20, pH=7.4) to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml of protein and destributed to 96-well microtiter plates precoated with 0.3 % PEI. Membranes in the presence of 0.05 nM [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-I , unlabelled ligands in increasing concentrations and different HSA concentrations (0.005%, 0.05%, and 2%) were incubated 2 hr at 3O<sup>0</sup>C. After incubation, unbound ligands were separated from bound ligands by filtration through a vacuum-manifold followed by 2X100 \u03bcl washing with ice cold assaybuffer. The filters were dried overnight at RT, punched out and quantified in a \u03b3-counter.</p>Example 1</p>[His3, L\u0398U10]-GLP-2(1 -33).</p>S F S D E L N T I L D N L A A R D F I N W L I Q T K I T D\u2014<sub>\u2122</sub> \n<img id=\"imgf000027_0001\" path=\"imgf000027_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5107861/WO/20060921/A2/002006/09/75/35/imgf000027_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>1 .a Synthesis of the peptidyl resin:</p>The protected peptidyl resin was synthesized according to the Fmoc strategy on an MultiSyntech Syro Il synthesizer in 53 micromol scale using the manufacturer supplied protocols which employ HBTU ( 2-(1 H-Benzotriazol-1 -yl-)-1 ,1 ,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) media"
