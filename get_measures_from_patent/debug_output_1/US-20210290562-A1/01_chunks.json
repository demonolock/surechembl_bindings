Stability of CBD Lipid Nanoparticles in Simulated Gastric and Intestinal FluidsThe stability of CBD Lipid Nanoparticles through the digestive process was simulated by measuring the particle size distribution in simulated gastric fluid after 2 hours, followed by dilution and incubation in simulated intestinal fluid after 4 hours. The CBD lipid nanoparticles were prepared using the solvent based manufacturing process at the 100 mL scale. Simulated gastric fluid was prepared by dissolving/dispersing 1 gram of sodium chloride (CAS 7647-14-5), 21.5 mg of sodium taurocholate (CAS 345909-26-4), 6.5 mg of lecithin (CAS 8002-43-5), and sufficient hydrochloric acid (CAS 7647-01-0) into purified water (QS 500 mL) to achieve a final pH of 1.6. Simulated intestinal fluid was prepared by dissolving/dispersing 1 gram of sodium chloride (CAS 7647-14-5), 806.5 mg of sodium taurocholate (CAS 345909-26-4), 64.4 mg of lecithin (CAS 8002-43-5), 1.1 grams of maleic acid (CAS 110-16-7), and 696 mg of sodium hydroxide (CAS 1310-73-2) in purified water (QS 500 mL). The pH was adjusted to 6.5 as needed. Simulated solutions were used immediately or stored at 4\u00b0 C. for no longer than 1 month.</p>Prior to starting the study, simulated gastric and intestinal fluids were equilibrated to 37\u00b0 C. Spectrum Laboratories Float-A-Lyzer G2 Dialysis devices (50 kD MWCO, 1 mL, Catalog #G235034) were equilibrated in 37\u00b0 C. water prior to use. The initial particle size distribution was measured before starting the experiment. One mL of CBD lipid nanoparticles was placed on the interior of the Float-A-Lyzer, the cap was affixed, and the Float-A-Lyzer was placed into 20 mL of simulated gastric fluid inside a 50 mL conical tube. The conical tube containing the simulate fluid and sample was placed inside a 37\u00b0 C. shaker incubator for 2 hours. At the end of the first incubation a sample was taken for particle size analysis. Immediately, the Float-A-Lyzer is placed in a new conical tube containing 20 mL of simulated intestinal fluid and returned to the 37\u00b0 C. shaker incubator for 4 hours. At the end of the second incubation a sample was taken for particle size analysis. The total time of the experiment was 6 hours. Three commercially available, oil-based CBD products were analyzed similarly. All samples were measured in triplicate.</p>Shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B show the change in particle size and polydispersity index over the incubation period in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. The CBD lipid nanoparticles experienced no change in particle size and a modest increase of PDI during the full incubation period. All the commercial oil-based CBD products experienced fluctuations in particle size and PDI during the incubation in simulated gastric and/or intestinal fluids, indicating an instability in the formulation during the digestive pro"
