    "signal of parent.According to the dose-dependently beta-lactam expression of enzymes of the CGRP of different concns and with the pharmacology of the numerical value of delivering before-cause, select the 4C10 clone.For the functional antagonistic activity of assessing compound in SK-N-MC (4C10) is, in the presence of CGRP, assessing compound is to the inhibition of beta-lactam expression of enzymes.</p>[00172] (MEM) cultivate SK-N-MC (4C10) in (Invitrogen) at MEM (Minimal Essential Media), with 1mM non--indispensable amino acid solution (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin-Streptomycin sulphate (Invitrogen), 1mM Sodium.alpha.-ketopropionate (Invitrogen) and the additional described substratum of 10% foetal calf serum.For the beta-lactam enzymatic determination, use low serum, 1%FBS is in MEM.Measuring the day before yesterday, 30,000 cells are being put into each hole of the 384-orifice plate (Becton Dickinson) of poly--D-Methionin bag quilt.With SK-N-MC (4C10) and compound preincubate 30 minutes, add 200pMCGRP then.To measure (assay) and hatch 3 hours, so that the beta-lactam expression of enzymes at 37 \u2103.Add the CCF4 dyestuff and incubated at room 2 hours.At excitation wavelength 400nm and emission wavelength 460nm (product) and 535nm (parent), use fluorescent plate reader (TopologyCompensatory plate reader (tcPR)) to read fluorescent signal.Be used for computing activation per-cent 460 with the ratio of 535nm place numerical value.Use MOD3 to carry out curve fitting and IC50 calculating.</p>[00173] is used for the K of computerized compound\n          <sub>i</sub>I\n          <sup>125</sup>-CGRP is in conjunction with the displacement test.\n        </p>[00174] buys the SK-N-MC film of purifying from Perkin Elmer.This film is melted fast and be placed on ice.(25mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,5mM MgCl with the CGRP binding soln with compound\n          <sub>2</sub>, 0.1%BSA and 0.05% tween) and dilution.This film is also used Tissue Matster-50 refiner (Omni International) homogenate 30 seconds with binding soln dilution (1: 20).To be added in the compound among the binding soln through the film of homogenate.After 10 minutes, is I125-iodine tyrosyl-thyrocalcitonin-gene related peptide (GE healthcare) adding film and the compound of 46pM with ultimate density in incubated at room.In incubated at room after 2 hours, the quick filtration stopped reaction of the GF/C screen plate of handling by 0.5%PEI (Perkin Elmer) also uses cell harvestor (Tomtec), wash solution (50mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4,5mM MgCl2 and 0.1%BSA) with ice-cold wash and wash screen plate.On Topcount (Packard), read the radioactivity of screen plate.Among control reaction, measure non-specific binding, wherein before adding I125-CGRP, with the unlabelled CGRP of 1uM with described film in advance-hatch.Not existing under the compound, among the control reaction of described film and I125-CGRP, measure total binding.Use per-cent non-specific and total binding contrast computerized compound displacement I125-CGRP.Use MOD3 to carry out curve fitting.With Cheng and Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W.H., Biochem.Pharmacol.22:3099-3108,1973), use the Kd of CGRP of described film and the amount of the I125-CGRP that is used to measure, the Ki of computerized compound.\n        </p>At I mentioned above\n          <sup>125</sup>-CGRP finds that in conjunction with among the test and among the functional antagonistic effect of CGRP mentioned above compound illustrative of the present invention in table 1-4 is the antagonist of CGRP.\n        </p>"
