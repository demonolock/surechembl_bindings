The addition of a DNA fragment to its unique XmaI site allows for the production of fusion proteins joined directly to the carboxyl terminus of the Fc, provided that the reading frame between the two sequences is maintained (Lo, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,087). Other proteins (e.g., antigen, serum albumin) can be fused to the amino termini of these subunits in the same manner. The advantages of this method include the large quantities of product produced and the ease of purification of the product by binding to and elution from protein A Sepharose.</p>The same general strategy was used to fuse the p35 subunit DNA to human Fc. In this case, a XmaI-BalI linker was synthesized using the oligonucleotides 5\u2032-CCGGGAAGAAACCTCCCCGTGG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 9) and 5\u2032-CCACGGGGAGGTTTCTTC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 10), which were ligated to a p35 subunit DNA, cut with BalI and XhoI, and subcloned as an XmaI-XhoI fragment in the pdC-Fc-X vector, as described above. The human p35 subunit has been shown to be active for human cells but not mouse cells, in terms of IL-12 activity, whereas the human p40 subunit does not show species specificity. Therefore, the human p40 subunit can be used to make either all human IL-12 fusion proteins or hybrid human/mouse fusion proteins.</p>The resulting constructs encode Fc-p35 or Fc-p40 fusion proteins which are expected to spontaneously dimerize into proteins of 120 kD (50 Kd from the Fc) and 130 kD respectively and to migrate after reduction on denaturing SDS gels as proteins of 60 kD and 65 kD. The individual subunit cDNAs were subcloned in the pdC expression vector (without the Fc) for their expression as independent proteins. This vector provides promoter sequences for expression of mRNA, transcribed from the cDNA insert, following the transfection of mammalian cells. It also provides for a 3\u2032 untranslated region and poly A addition site, downstream of the 3\u2032 XhoI insertion site. There are also sequences necessary for the propagation of the plasmid in E. coli and selection with ampicillin, as well as a selectable marker gene, such as dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), for conferring resistance to methotrexate. These same components are also used in the pdC-Fc-X vector for expression of the fusion proteins.</p>For expression of biologically-active IL-12 fusion protein heterodimers, different combinations of the individual vectors encoding fusion and non-fusion forms of the subunits were transiently expressed by co-transfection of human 293 epidermal carcinoma cells. DNA was purified using preparative kits (Wizard, Promega Inc.), ethanol precipitated for sterilization and resuspension in sterile water. Calcium phosphate precipitates were prepared by standard methods using 10 \u03bcg of DNA per ml (5 \u03bcg of each when two plasmids were co-transfected) and 0.5 ml/plate were added to cultures of 293 growing in 60 mm plates at approximately 70% confluency.

    "l XbaI to XhoI fragments were inserted into the corresponding sites of the same expression vector (pdC) used to express the free IL-12 subunits to give vectors pdC-SCA-hu-p35 and pdC-SCA-mu-p35.</p>These vectors were introduced into a human p40 expressing cell line and grown in medium containing methotrexate (0.1 \u03bcM). Fusion protein-expressing, drug-resistant clones were identified by ELISA assays specific for the species of p35 utilized in the construct (i.e., an IL-12 human p40 antibody was used for antigen capture, and specific anti-mouse or human-p35 antibodies were used for detection). Culture media from each type of single-chain fusion protein were used to determine their amounts so that relative specific activities could be calculated. Serial dilutions of each sample were tested for the ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion as detailed above in Example 2. The results are shown in FIG. 6, which compares the activity of single-chain IL-12 fusion proteins made with either both human subunits or with mouse p35 and human p40, as well as the species specificity of the fusion proteins. The data show that the human IL-12 single chain fusion protein is as active as the whole antibody fusions in its ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 but that it is not as potent as the human IL-12 standard when human PBMC were used (FIG. 6A). The hybrid mouse/human form was approximately 50-fold less than the mouse IL-12 control as was seen with the whole antibody construct (FIG. 6B). FIG. 6C shows an antigen binding assay of the single-chain IL-12 proteins. Plates were coated with the KS antigen recognized by the KS-1/4 antibody and used to capture any reactive antibody or antibody fusion protein. After washing several times, the bound fusion protein was detected using an anti-human IL-12 p40 antibody. The data show that the single-chain fusion proteins bound to the antigen coated plate and could be detected with an antibody against IL-12, thus demonstrating that the fused molecules retain antigen binding activity. The intensity of binding was roughly 3-fold lower than that seen with the whole KS-1/4 antibody but this is not unexpected, due to the monovalency of the single chain construct.</p>The activity results with both whole antibody and single chain IL-12 fusion proteins suggest that the amino terminus of the p35 chain may be important to receptor binding since fusions appear to reduce activity. Nonetheless, the antibody-IL-12 molecules are still very potent inducers of IFN-\u03b3 at concentrations above 1 ng/ml. The concentration of such molecules in treated animals is expected to be several orders of magnitude higher than this both in the circulation, and at the target site of action.</p>A possible way to increase the specific activity of antibody-IL-12 fusion proteins would be to insert a flexible peptide linker between the antibody and p35 sequences thus giving more freedom to the amino terminal sequences of this subunit.
