    "a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. An isolated polypeptide includes an isolated antibody, or a fragment or derivative \n\nthereof. \u201cAntibody\u201d includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. </p>[0078] In certain embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and in other aspects to more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. </p>[0079] The term \u201cheterologous,\u201d in the context of a polypeptide, means from a different source (e.g., a cell, tissue, organism, or species) as compared with another polypeptide, so that the two polypeptides are different. Typically, a heterologous polypeptide is from a different species. </p>[0080] In the context of immunoglobulin polypeptides or fragments thereof, \u201cconservative substitution\u201d means one or more amino acid substitutions that do not substantially reduce specific binding (e.g., as measured by the KD) of the immunoglobulin polypeptide or fragment thereof to an antigen (i.e., substitutions that increase binding affinity, that do not significantly alter binding affinity, or that reduce binding affinity by no more than about 40%, typically no more than about 30%, more typically no more than about 20%, even more typically no more than about 10%, or most typically no more than about 5%, as determined by standard binding assays such as, e.g., ELISA). </p>[0081] The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cpercent identity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. To determine the percent identity, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g, gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., \n\n% iden",

Anti-CD70 Antibodies </p>[0122] The invention provides anti-CD70 antibodies, such as humanized antibodies derived from the mouse antibody 1F6. 1F6 is a murine immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody against CD70. 1F6 and humanized 1F6 variants are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,067,546 and International Patent Publication WO 2006/113909. In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody is nonfucosylated. </p>[0123] The binding affinity of humanized forms of the mouse 1F6 antibody (i.e., dissociation constant, KD) is preferably within a factor of five or a factor of two of that of the mouse antibody 1F6 for human CD70. Humanized 1F6 antibodies specifically bind to human CD70 in native form and/or recombinantly expressed from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as does the mouse antibody from which they were derived. Preferred humanized 1F6 antibodies have an affinity the same as or greater than (i.e., greater than beyond margin of error in measurement) that of 1F6 for human CD70 (e.g., 1.1-5 fold, 1.1 to 3 fold, 1.5 to 3- fold, 1.7 to 2.3-fold or 1.7- 2.1-fold the affinity or about twice the affinity of 1F6). Preferred humanized 1F6 antibodies bind to the same epitope and/or compete with 1F6 for binding to human CD70. </p>[0124] In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention inhibit cancer (e.g., growth of cells, metastasis and/or lethality to the organisms) as shown on cancerous cells propagating in culture, in an animal model or clinical trial. Animal models can be formed by implanting CD70- expressing human tumor cell lines into appropriate immunodeficient rodent strains, e.g., athymic nude mice or SCID mice. These tumor cell lines can be established in immunodeficient rodent \n\nhosts either as solid tumor by subcutaneous injections or as disseminated tumors by intravenous injections. </p>[0125] Once established within a host, these tumor models can be applied to evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of the anti-CD70 antibodies, or conjugated forms thereof, as described in the Exam",

In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising the three CDRs and a light chain variable region comprising the three CDRs of the anti-CD70 antibody vorsetuzumab. In some embodiments, the CDRs are defined by the Rabat numbering scheme. </p>[0153] In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region or a light chain variable region of the anti-CD70 antibody vorsetuzumab. In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region of the anti-CD70 antibody vorsetuzumab. </p>[0154] In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody is vorsetuzumab. </p>[0155] Anti-CD70 antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to CD70 ( e.g ., human CD70). Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or KD less than 5 x 10<sup>-2</sup> M, 10<sup>-2</sup> M, 5x 10<sup>-3</sup> M, 10<sup>-3</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-4</sup> M, 10<sup>-4</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-5</sup> M, 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-6</sup> M, 10<sup>-6</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-7</sup> M, 10<sup>-7</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-8</sup> M, 10<sup>-8</sup>M, 5x10<sup>-9</sup> M, 10<sup>-9</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-10</sup>M, 10<sup>-10</sup> M, 5x 10<sup>-n</sup> M, 10<sup>-11</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-12</sup> M, 10<sup>-12</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-13</sup> M, 10<sup>-13</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-14</sup> M, 10<sup>-14</sup> M, 5x10<sup>-15</sup> M, or 10<sup>-15</sup> M. </p>[0156] There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated a, d, e, g and m, respectively. The g and a classes are further divided into subclasses e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. IgG1 antibodies can exist in multiple polymorphic variants termed allotypes (reviewed in Jefferis and Lefranc 2009. mAbs Vol 1 Issue 4 1-7) any of which are suitable for use in some of the embodiments herein. Common allotypic variants in human populations are those designated by the letters a, f, n, z or combinations thereof. In any of the embodiments herein, the antibody may comprise a heavy chain Fc region comprising a human IgGFc region. In further embodiments, the human IgGFc region comprises a human IgG1. \n\n[0157] In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain as in any of th",
    "of mAb 1F6 to CD70, as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding (such as e.g, the immunoassays described herein). In typical embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding of 1F6 to CD70 by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, or at least 75%. In other embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding of 1F6 to CD70 by at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95%. </p>[0185] Antibodies can be assayed for specific binding to CD70 by any of various known methods. Immunoassays which can be used include, for example, competitive and non- competitive assay systems using techniques such as Western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays. Such assays are routine and well-known in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel et al. , eds., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 4th ed. \n\n1999); Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999.) </p>[0186] Further, the binding affinity of an antibody to CD70 and the off-rate of an antibody CD70 interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled CD70 ( e.g ., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled CD70, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled CD70. The affinity of the antibody for CD70 and the binding off-rates can then be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody (such as e.g, mAb 1F6) can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, CD70 is incubated with the antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g, <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. Alternatively, the binding affinity of an antibody to CD70 and the on- and off-rates of an antibody-CD70 interaction can be determined by surface plasmon resonance. In some embodiments, the anti-CD70 antibodies or derivatives thereof can be targeted to and accumulate on the membrane of a CD70-expressing cell. </p>[0187] Anti-CD70 antibodies and derivatives thereof can be produced by methods known in the art for the synthesis of proteins, typically, e.g., by recombinant expression techniques. Recombinant expression of an antibody or derivative thereof that binds to CD70 typically includes construction of an expression vector containing a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody or derivative thereof. A vector for the production of the protein molecule may be produced by recombinant "
