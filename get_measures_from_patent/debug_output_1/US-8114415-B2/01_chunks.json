    " incubated at 33\u00b0 C. One set of the infected plates was fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde at 6 hr post infection for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min followed by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-NP monoclonal antibodies. The cell images captured by ORCA-100 digital camera were analyzed by Compix image capture and dynamic intensity analysis software, Version 5.3 (Cranberry Township, Pa.) to calculate the percentage of the infected cells. Another set of plates was incubated at 33\u00b0 C. At various times of intervals, 250 \u03bcl of culture supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. in the presence of SPG prior to virus titration. After each aliquot was removed, an equal amount of fresh medium was added to the cells. The virus titer in these aliquots was determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells at 33\u00b0 C.</p>To determine whether the binding difference between these viruses affected virus growth kinetics in MDCK cells, the infected MDCK cells were incubated at 33\u00b0 C. and the culture supernatants were collected at various times for virus titration. When adsorbed at 33\u00b0 C., 6:2 A/Fujian had slower growth kinetics and lower titer (FIG. 2), 6:2 A/Sendai, A/Fujian with HA-V1861226 or HA-L183A226 behaved similarly to 6:2 A/Wyoming. When adsorption was done at 4\u00b0 C., 6:2 A/Fujian as well as 6:2 A/Sendai had slower growth kinetics. 6:2 A/Wyoming and the two A/Fujian variants grew similarly. These results were consistent with the virus-binding assay whereas the washing step reduced efficient infection of A/Fujian at both temperatures.</p>Antigenicity of 6:2 recombinant viruses: Antigenicity of each virus was analyzed by hemaglutinin inhibition (HAI) assay using ferret anti-A/Sendai and anti-A/Wyoming sera. Aliquots of 25 \u03bcl of 2-fold serially diluted ferret antisera were incubated with 25 II virus containing 4 HA units of 6:2 reassortant viruses at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr followed by incubation with 50 ul of 0.5% turkey red blood cells (RBC) at 25\u00b0 C. for 45 min. The HAI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited hemaglutinnation.</p>Generation of 6:2 A/Fujian, A/Sendai, and A/Wyoming Vaccine Strains</p>Wild-type (wt) influenza A virus strains, A/Fujian/411/02, A/Sendai-H/F4962/02 and A/Wyoming/03/03 were obtained from the Center for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga.) and amplified once in MDCK cells or in embryonated chicken eggs. As indicated in Table 20, A/Fujian was only passaged for three times in cell culture, whereas A/Sendai and A/Wyoming went through 11 passages in eggs. The HA and NA sequences of these three strains were determined by sequencing of the RT-PCR products using vRNA extracted from these viruses. The difference in the HA and NA sequence of these three H3N2 strains is listed in Table 1. A/Sendai was identical to A/Fujian in its HAI amino acid sequence but differed in the NA sequence at three amino acids at positions 119, 146 and 347. A/Wyoming had the NA sequen"
