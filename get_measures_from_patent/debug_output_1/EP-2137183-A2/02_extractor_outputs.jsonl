{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nCompounds 1-1 and 1-2 were found to inhibit GSK-3 at a Ki value of < 5 nM.\nFor determination of GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 pTYR IC50, the density of the respective bands for each protein at specific compound concentration is compared to a no compound DMSO treated control cell sample present on each exposure. IC50 numbers are defined as the concentration of compound in which the density of the GSK-3\u03b1 or GSK-3\u03b2 band is 50% of the no compound control.\nThe GSK-3 IC50 for induction of \u03b2-catenin is determined by plotting the 460/530 ratio against the concentration of compound (Log scale) and using the equation of the slope to calculate the point at which the ratio is 50% of the maximum effect.\nBoth compounds 1-1 and 1-2 were found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b1 window between 400 and 500 fold. Compound 1-1 was found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b2 window between 75 and 100 fold and compound 2 was found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b2 window between 25 and 50 fold."}
