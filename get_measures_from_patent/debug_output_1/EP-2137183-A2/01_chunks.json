Final substrate concentrations in the assay were 20 \u03bcM ATP (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO) and 300 \u03bcM peptide (American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA) . Reactions were carried out at 30 <sup>0</sup>C and 20 nM GSK-3\u03b2. Final concentrations of the components of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 300 \u03bcM NADH, 30 \u03bcg/ml pyruvate kinase and 10 \u03bcg/ml lactate dehydrogenase.</p>[00141] An assay stock buffer solution was prepared containing all of the reagents listed above with the exception of ATP and the test compound of the present invention. The assay stock buffer solution (175 \u03bcl) was incubated in a 96 well plate with 5 \u03bcl of the test compound of the present invention at final concentrations spanning 0.002 \u03bcM to 30 \u03bcM at 3O<sup>0</sup>C for 10 min. Typically, a 12-point titration was conducted by preparing serial dilutions (from 10 mM compound stocks) with DMSO of the test compounds of the present invention in daughter plates. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bcl of ATP (final \n\nconcentration 20 \u03bcM) . Rates of reaction were obtained using a Molecular Devices Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA) over 10 min at 3O<sup>0</sup>C. The K<sub>1</sub> values were determined from the rate data as a function of inhibitor concentration. Compounds of the invention were found to inhibit GSK-3. [00142] Compounds 1-1 and 1-2 were found to inhibit GSK-3 at a Ki value of &lt; 5 nM.</p>Example 3: GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 p-TYR Inhibition Assay [00143] Compounds are screened for their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of tyrosine (TYR) residues through the use of western blotting of Jurkat cells dosed with the compounds. The phosphorylation of the specific TYR residues tested are GSK3\u03b1 TYR 279 and GSK3\u03b2 TYR 216.</p>Preparation of Cells and Lysates</p>[00144] Jurkat cells are seeded at a density of 2xl\u03b8<sup>5</sup>cells/well in a 12 well dish in starvation media</p>(RPMI+1%FBS+P/S) . Following starvation for 16 hours, the compound is dosed into each well at a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% and cells are incubated o/n at 37<sup>0</sup>C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The next day, cells are spun down at 1500 rpm, washed with PBS, and lysed in lOOuL Laemli sample buffer with \u03b2- mercaptoethanol .</p>Western Blot Protocol</p>[00145] 15 microliters (uL) of cell lysates are loaded onto a 10% tris-glycine gel and run at 12Ov for 2 hours or until dye front runs off of the gel. The protein is then transferred onto a PVDF membrane at 10Ov for 60 min. PBST</p>(PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, such as ImI Tween per IL of PBS) is then made up and used for all washes and antibody \n\nincubations. The blot is blocked in 5% nonfat milk PBST for one hour.</p>[00146] The primary antibody (GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 pTYR 279/216 at 1:1000 dilution Upstate cat#05-413) is then added in 5%- nonfat milk PBST overnight at 4 <sup>0</sup>C with gentle rocking. The blot is then washed in PBST for 5 min. This is then repeated 4 times. A secondary anti-mouse-HRP conjugated antibody (1:5000 dilution) is added for 60min in 5%milk PBST. The blot is then washed in PBST for 5min. This is also repeated 4 times. 3.OmL of the developing solution (ECL plus Western Blotting Detection System from Amersham/GE cat# RPN2132) is made and then added. The solution is swirled over the blot for -30 sec. The blot is then developed using CL-Xposure clear blue X-ray film. GAPDH expression level is used as a loading control, (GAPDH antibody: santa cruz 25-778) at 1:10000 dilution.</p>[00147] For determination of GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 pTYR IC50, the density of the respective bands for each protein at specific compound concentration is compared to a no compound DMSO treated control cell sample present on each exposure. IC50 numbers are defined as the concentration of compound in which the density of the GSK-3\u03b1 or GSK-3\u03b2 band is 50% of the no compound control.</p>Example 4: \u03b2-Catenin Stabilization Protocol [00148] GSK-3 phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin targets it to the proteosome for degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3 results in accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cytosol of cells which through interaction with the transcription factor TCF/LEF translocates to the nucleus and drives the transcription of Wnt-dependent genes. The assay is designed to determine the level of \u03b2-catenin dependent TCF/LEF transcriptional \n\nactivity in a quantitative manner through the use of a \u03b2- lactamase reporter assay in Jurkat cells dosed with a compound.</p>[00149] Jurkat \u03b2-catenin cells are starved overnight in assay media (1% FBS, Ix Penstrep, RPMI) in the flask. The next day Jurkat \u03b2-catenin cells are seeded in 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in assay media in a volume of lOOul. The compound is added to the well at a final DMSO concentration of 0.75% and incubated at 37<sup>0</sup>C o/n. The next day, 2OuL of 6x CCF4 dye is added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1-2 hours. Plates are read on the Cytofluor 4000 series multiwell plate reader and the 460/530 ratio is determined. The GSK-3 IC50 for induction of \u03b2-catenin is determined by plotting the 460/530 ratio against the concentration of compound (Log scale) and using the equation of the slope to calculate the point at which the ratio is 50% of the maximum effect. [00150] \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3 windows were calculated by dividing the \u03b2-catenin IC50 value obtained in Example 4 by the GSK-3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 p-TYR IC50 value obtained in Example 3. [00151] Both compounds 1-1 and 1-2 were found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b1 window between 400 and 500 fold. Compound 1-1 was found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b2 window between 75 and 100 fold and compound 2 was found to have a \u03b2-catenin : GSK-3\u03b2 window between 25 and 50 fold. [00152] Table 3 shows GSK-3\u03b1 pTYR, GSK-3\u03b2 pTYR, and \u03b2-catenin IC50 data for select compounds of Table 1.</p>Table 3</p>\nExample 5: Collection of Cytoplasmic Fractions From Tissues.

All concentrations are final and are diluted in water.</p>[00154] First, hypotonic lysis buffer is added to the tissue at 5x' s weight. The tissue is then broken up on ice using the end of a syringe plunger. Next, the samples are freeze-thawed five times. The lysates are then transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and spun at 100,00Og for 35 min at 4<sup>0</sup>C. The supernatants are then collected and an aliquot is taken to measure protein with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (cat#23225) , using BSA standard curve. The remaining protein lysates are diluted 1:1 with laemmli sample buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol . The protein concentration is then normalized. The samples are boiled for 5 min at 95 <sup>0</sup>C followed by a spin at 14,000 rpm in a mini-centrifuge for 1 min. The samples are then snap frozen with dry ice and stored at -20<sup>0</sup>C.</p>Western Protocol</p>[00155] The samples are first loaded on 10% Tris-glycine gel (lOuL/well) . The gel is then run at 120V until the dye marker runs off of gel. The PVDF membrane is cut and soaked in methanol for 5 min before use. The protein is then transferred to a PVDF membrane at 100V ",

The blot is then washed in PBST for 5 min. This is then repeated 4 times. A secondary anti-mouse-HRP conjugated antibody (1:5000 dilution) is added for 60min in 5%milk PBST. The blot is then washed in PBST for 5min. This is also repeated 4 times .</p>[00178] 3.OmL of the developing solution (ECL plus Western Blotting Detection System from Amersham/GE cat# RPN2132) is made and then added.

GAPDH expression level is used as a loading control, (GAPDH antibody: santa cruz 25-778) at 1:10000 dilution. The CRMP2 antibody detects both the unphosphorylated form of CRMP2 and the phosphorylated form of CRMP2 (T514) which is the residue phosphorylated by GSK-3 (Kim et al. 2006 Neuron). The IC50 of compounds for pCRMP2 \n\nis defined as the concentration of compound in which the density of the supershifted pCRMP2 band is 50% of the no compound control.
