IC50 numbers are defined as the concentration of compound in which the density of the GSK-3α or GSK-3β band is 50% of the no compound control.\nThe GSK-3 IC50 for induction of β-catenin is determined by plotting the 460/530 ratio against the concentration of compound (Log scale) and using the equation of the slope to calculate the point at which the ratio is 50% of the maximum effect.\nBoth compounds 1-1 and 1-2 were found to have a β-catenin : GSK-3α window between 400 and 500 fold. Compound 1-1 was found to have a β-catenin : GSK-3β window between 75 and 100 fold and compound 2 was found to have a β-catenin : GSK-3β window between 25 and 50 fold."
