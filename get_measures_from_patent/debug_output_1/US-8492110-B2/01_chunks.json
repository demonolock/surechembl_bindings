    "ents that Prevent cdc13-1 Cell Death Using an Apoptotic AssayCell death in cdc13-1 exhibits apoptotic markers. This characteristic can be employed for high-throughput screening since it takes less time than the cell surviving assay mentioned in Example 1. It can also be used for confirming positives identified from the high-throughput screening in Example 1. In addition, this assay can also be used to screen for agents that inhibit apoptosis.</p>After incubating at a non-permissive temperature (about 37\u00b0 C.) for a day (about 18-24 hrs), the cdc13-1 cells with compounds are stained with FITC-conjugated z-VAD-FMK (a suicide substrate that only binds to activated caspase), or other suitable apoptotic detecting agents, for 20 min in the dark. Cells may be washed once with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Plates are read by a fluorescent microplate reader. The negative control (cells in the absence of the compounds or compositions screened) would have a high FITC signal due to cell death. The compounds or compositions that reduce the FITC signals are considered as positives or primary candidates. They are confirmed by assay the surviving cells as in Example 1, and further tested for their ability to reduce ROS and improve mitochondrial function. These activities will also be tested in human telomere dysfunction models such as WI-38 senescent cells. Their activity in preventing cancer and other age-related diseases or disorders are further tested in proper models.</p>The annexin V binding assay to measure phosphotidylserine flipping has been described in FIG. 3B as an apoptotic marker. It can also be used for high-throughput screening.</p>Example 3Identification of Agents that Prevent cdc13-1 Cell Death by Measuring ROS (as Shown in FIG. 20)Cell death in cdc13-1 exhibits dramatically elevated ROS levels. This characteristic can be used to search molecules that inhibit cdc13-1 cell death. The ROS assay takes less time than the cell surviving assay described in Example 1, and can be used in the high-throughput screening, as well as in confirming the primary candidates identified from high-throughput screening of Examples 1 and 2. In addition, this assay can also be used to screen for antioxidants.</p>FIG. 20 illustrates the procedure. After incubating at a non-permissive temperature (37\u00b0 C.) for a day, the treated cells are stained with dehydrorhodamine 123 (or other suitable ROS detection agents) for about one hour in the dark. Plates are read by a fluorescent microplate reader. The negative control (i.e., cells in the absence of the compounds or compositions screened) should have high levels of ROS released during cell death. The compounds or compositions that reduce the ROS are considered to be primary candidates, which are further tested for cell death prevention and mitochondrial function improvement in both yeast and human models. Their activity in preventing cancer, neuron degeneration and other age-related diseases or disorders are then further t"
