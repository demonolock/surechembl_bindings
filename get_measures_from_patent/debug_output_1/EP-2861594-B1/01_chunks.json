    "in-2-yl]-1,7-diazaspiro[4.4]nonan-6-one hydrochloridem/z: 405 (M+H+)Using D38R in place of D15</p>BIOLOGICAL ASSAYSThe compounds of the invention were tested in a QPatch NaV1.7 assay.</p>QPatch NaV1.7 AssayHEK293-hNaV1.7 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 + 10% FBS culture media at 37\u00b0C. At a confluency of 50-70% cells were dissociated from culture flasks &amp; triturated to ensure unicellular cell suspension; cell density was measured &amp; adjusted to 2-3 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Recordings were obtained using QPatch16x. The external solution was (in mM): NaCl, 128; KCl, 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; Glucose, 30; HEPES, 15; pH 7.3, 305-315 mOsm. Following seal formation and whole-cell access using internal solution (containing in mM: CsF, 135; EGTA/CsOH, 1/5; HEPES 10; NaCl, 10; pH 7.3, 310-320mOsM), voltage pulse protocols were applied. Initially a steady state inactivation voltage protocol was used to determine the half-maximal voltage for steady state inactivation (V1/2 SSI). Two holding voltages were used to determine test drug inhibition: -90 mV, where most of the channels are in a closed state; and V1/2 SSI, where half of the channels are inactivated. Currents were elicited every 10 seconds by stepping to a membrane potential of 0 mV for 20 ms. Four-point cumulative concentration responses were derived by determining the peak current amplitude at each concentration of test drug over 120 second application. Curves were fitted with the Hill equation yielding pIC50 values at -90 mV and V1/2 SSI holding potentials.\nExample NumberQP Nav1.7 - 90mV pIC50QP Nav1.7 SSI vhalf pIC5013.95.023.44.233.84.543.64.454.1463.54.173.95.784.45.694.95.8104.75.8114.15.4124.75.7135.15.8144.75.9153.94.9163.94.9174.25183.94.9193.74.7203.74.6213.74.8222.14.2232.84.2243.84.7254.35.1263.24.3274.25.0283.24.3293.94.9303.54.7314.05.5324.45.6334.75.7344.15.1374.85.8384.35.5393.94.8403.84.5414.65.6423.34.3434.55.3443.84.4454.04.7464.65.5</p>"
