    "onal number of molecules are expressed in greater numbers on diseased cells than on normal cells. These molecules can permit some preferential delivery of agents to diseased cells over normal cells, depending on the degree to which the molecule is overexpressed in diseased cells compared to normal cells.</p>Even with substantial overexpression of the target molecule on target cells, however, delivery of targeted therapeutic agents have often been accompanied by adverse side effects due to binding of the agent to normal cells expressing the target molecule. For example, the HER2 (erbB2) receptor that is the target for the FDA-approved immunotherapeutic agent Herceptin\u00ae, is overexpressed at levels some 10 to 100 times more than the expression of the HER2 receptor in non-cancer cells. Nonetheless, a percentage of patients develop cardiac arrhythmia and other adverse side effects due to binding of Herceptin\u00ae to normal cells.</p>Thus, it would be desirable to increase the therapeutic window of immunotherapeutic agents by developing bsBAs with an improved ability to bind to target cells without binding to non-target cells.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides new compositions of bispecific binding agents, as well as kits comprising them and methods and uses for them.</p>In a first group of embodiments, the invention provides methods for modulating a biological activity of a target cell using a bispecific binding agent (i) having a first binding domain having a Kd for a first target molecule on the surface of said cell of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less and a second binding domain having a Kd for a second target molecule on the surface of said cell, (ii) which second target molecule is different than said first target molecule, (iii) wherein said affinity of said second binding domain for said second target molecule is at least 10 times greater than the Kd of said first binding domain to said first target molecule, and (iv) further wherein when the target molecule of said first binding domain is ErbB2, the target molecule for said second binding domain is not ErbB3, comprising contacting the bispecific binding agent with the target cell under conditions that permit the first and second binding domains to bind to the first and second target molecules, respectively, wherein binding of the second binding domain to the second target molecule modulates the biological activity of the second target molecule, thereby modulating a biological activity of the target cell, and further wherein binding of said first binding domain to the first target molecule does not modulate a biological activity of the target cell.

Thus, one goal of the scientific community has been to develop immunotherapeutic agents with an improved ability to bind target cells (e.g., disease cells) without also binding non-target cells (that is, normal cells).</p>The present invention provides compositions and methods for improving the specificity of one class of immunotherapeutic agents for binding target cells. These methods and compositions provide an improved ability to modulate biological activity of target cells without affecting the corresponding activity of non-target cells. Surprisingly, it has now been discovered that the specificity of targeting diseased cells by the immunotherapeutic agents known as bispecific binding agents (\u201cbsBAs\u201d) can be increased by controlling the differences in the binding affinities of the two binding domains of the bsBAs. The bsBAs of the invention can then be used for increasing or decreasing the biological activity of a target molecule on the target cells, and thereby provide an improved ability to modulate biological activity of target cells with r",
    "al affinity for both receptors will tend to have roughly equal effects on both cancer cells and on normal, non-cancer cells. This is particularly in the case where high concentrations of bsBAs are achieved, since the bsBAs will tend to saturate both receptors by monovalent binding.</p>By contrast, a bsBA of the invention, having a higher affinity targeting domain targeted to receptor A and a lower affinity effector domain targeted to receptor B, and having 10, 20, 30, or even more times more affinity for receptor A than for receptor B, will preferentially bind to the cancer cells, and by normal kinetic interactions, will bind in larger numbers to the cancer cells as compared to normal cells. Instead of promiscuously binding to cells bearing receptor B, including substantial numbers of normal cells, therefore, the effector domain will be selectively delivered to the cancer cells. Thus, the invention permits more selective targeting of effector domain to target cells.</p>Further, the binding of the higher affinity binding domain to receptor A tethers the lower affinity, effector domain in proximity to the cell surface, where it is available to interact with receptor B over time. This permits the effector domain to bind receptor B even though its relatively low affinity for receptor B might not normally be sufficient to hold it to the receptor were the effector domain provided as a \u201cfree standing,\u201d monovalent (or \u201cunivalent\u201d) entity.</p>Persons of skill will appreciate that the dissociation constant (\u201cKd\u201d) of an antibody or other ligand is determined both by the k<sub>on </sub>and by the k<sub>off </sub>of the ligand. That is, the Kd represents the balance between the time the antibody or other ligand is bound to the target molecule and the time that it is not. A low affinity binding domain therefore often has a low affinity precisely because it has a high tendency to dissociate from its target molecule. During the period a binding domain dissociates from its target molecule, it can be moved away by Brownian movement, fluid flow, or other kinetic forces acting on the binding domain molecule. The tethering of the low affinity domain by the high affinity domain of the bsBA aids in maintaining the low affinity binding domain in proximity to the receptor targeted by the low affinity domain, and thus tends to increase the probability that at any point in time the low affinity domain will be able to bind its target molecule. Since the target molecule of the low affinity domain of the bsBAs of the invention in this hypothetical is a receptor kinase, this tends to increase the ability of the bsBA to bind the target receptor kinase and therefore increases their biological effect on target cells.</p>In preferred embodiments, the two binding domains of the bsBAs of the invention bind target molecules that are not normally bound by the same ligand. Persons of skill are aware that some ligands, such as the interleukin IL-2, for example, are bound by two different receptor chains, and that the two chains\u2014with bound IL-2\u2014then interact to form the fully biologically active unit. While bsBAs directed to the two recepto",
    " a targeting domain that targets a cell surface receptor overexpressed on the particular cells to be targeted by the particular bsBA.</p>In some embodiments, the targeting domain of the bsBA binds to a first cell surface receptor that is preferentially expressed or overexpressed on a target cell that is associated with a disease or disorder (for example, a cancer cell) and the effector domain binds to a second cell surface receptor that is overexpressed on disease cells (such as cancer cells) compared to normal cells, but is expressed at lower levels than is the first cell surface receptor. In these embodiments, the differential in expression level between the first and the second cell surface receptors again improves the specific delivery of effector molecules to cells with target molecules.</p>As noted in the Background, even though HER2 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells at levels some 10 to 100 times that of its expression on normal cells, some adverse side effects are seen in patients from binding of the immunotherapeutic agent, HERCEPTIN\u00ae, to normal cells. Thus, even substantial overexpression of a target molecule is not necessarily sufficient to keep high affinity binding agents from binding to normal cells, with adverse side effects.</p>By contrast, the bsBAs of the invention have a targeting domain that is chosen to have an affinity for its target molecule that is at least 10 times higher, and often much higher, than that of the effector domain. Preferably, the dissociation constant of the targeting domain for its target molecule is in the range of 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M. The target molecule is selected either because it is not present on normal cells, or because it is highly overexpressed on cancer cells than on normal cells, preferably at least 20 times and even more preferably 100 times more than it is expressed on normal cells. As noted, due to the high affinity of the targeting domain for the target molecule, it will tend to bind the bsBA preferentially to the target cell. Thus, it is anticipated that the effector domain can target a target molecule expressed on normal cells and still achieve selective binding that provides a therapeutic window larger than that of conventional bsBAs.</p>Persons of skill will appreciate that cancer cells, in particular, tend to upregulate the expression of many normal proteins, including many with roles in maintaining homeostasis in normal cells. Thus, even proteins not normally considered to be cancer or tumor antigens tend to be upregulated on cancer cells. For instance, insulin receptor, which is not considered a tumor antigen, is often upregulated 3-5 fold on tumor cells as compared to normal cells (see, e.g., Milazzo et al., Cancer Res. 52(14):3924-30 (1992)).</p>As another example, the ErbB3 receptor is somewhat overexpressed on some cancer cells compared to its expression on normal cells. It can, however, be used as the effector target molecule of a bsBA when the targeting domain is directed to a target molecule that is even more highly overexpressed. The Examples present an exemplar bsBA of the invention in which the targeting domain is directed to EGFR and the effector domain is targeted to ErbB 3.</p>It is desirable that the targeting domain is directed to a target molecule (such as a cancer antigen) that is overexpressed on the target cells, while the effector domain is directed to a molecule (e.g., a receptor kinase) that is expressed at a lower level than is the target molecule for the targeting domain. While it is only necessary that the target molecule is expressed at higher levels than the molecule targeted by the effector domain, in general, significant differences between the expression of the target molecule and the expression of the effector molecule are advantageous, since the effector molecules can be saturated at bsBA concentrations that are below the Kd of the targeting domain.</p>In general, it is preferable that the target molecule for the targeting domain is overexpressed at levels 10, 20, 50, 100, or more times higher than expression of that molecule on non-target cells, with each successively higher level being more preferred. In general, it is further preferred that the effector molecule be expressed either at the level it is expressed on non-target cells or, if it is overexpressed, that it is overexpressed at levels of 2 to 5 times that of non-target cells. In other words, it is preferable that the targeting molecule be expressed (or overexpressed) at high levels relative to the molecule bound by the effector domain.</p>Where the target cell is a disease cell, such as a cancer cell, the expression level of the target molecule is measured against the expression of the same molecule on normal cells of the same tissue type as that from which the cancer cell originates. That is, if the disease cell is a breast cancer cell, the expression level is measured against a normal breast cell, while the expression level of molecules of an ovarian cancer cell is measured against expression levels on normal ovary cells. Usually, a population of cells is used and an average value of expression level (e.g., number of molecules expressed per cell) is determined.</p>Further, in some preferred embodiments, the cell surface antigen recognized and bound by the effector domain is chosen to have a biological activity that can be modulated",
    "ferred to herein as \u201cmodulating\u201d the activity of the target molecule.</p>For example, some cancers result from the mutation of a gene encoding a receptor that acts as a tyrosine kinase, resulting in the receptor becoming either constitutively active or overexpressed, so that the cell proliferates more than it would with a normal receptor or with one expressed in normal amounts. To decrease the activity of the receptor, the practitioner may, in this example, select a binding agent whose binding is known to change the conformation of the constitutively active receptor to reduce its activity or, in the case of an overexpressed receptor, to simply block it from being bound by its natural ligand, thus preventing the overexpression from resulting in an inappropriate increase in signaling within the target cell. Conversely, if the target molecule is one whose activity it is desirable to enhance, the practitioner may select a binding agent whose binding is known to act as an agonist of the activity.</p>The use of bsBAs with a single high affinity binding domain is sufficient to provide specific binding to cells of interest. Studies have shown that binding agents with two high affinity binding domains directed to a single target molecule have only about three fold the affinity for the target molecule compared to a univalent binding agent with the same binding domain. Nielsen, U. et al., Cancer Res. 60(22):6434-40 (2000). A univalent binding agent will therefore typically still have a Kd in the nanomolar range. Since therapeutic agents are typically administered in amounts to provide up to micromolar concentrations, a thousand times the Kd of the binding agent, the high concentration of the binding agent relative to the Kd of the high affinity targeting domain is expected to permit binding of the agent to target cells bearing the target molecule. Thus, the high affinity targeting domain of the bsBAs of the invention is expected to provide specific binding of the bsBAs under the conditions in which they will be administered.</p>It is expected that the practitioner can select appropriate combinations of target molecules for the targeting domain and for the effector domain. While a number of preferred target molecules and effector target molecules are described below, it may be helpful to list some preferred target molecules and effector target molecules. Some preferred target molecules are EGFR and ErbB2. Some preferred effector target molecules are: ErbB3, ErbB4, any of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors 1-4, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF 1-R), insulin receptor, Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) receptors alpha and beta, and C-KIT. Each of these molecules is known in the art and is identified by its reference number in the SWISS-PROT database in a later section.</p>Finally, the bsBAs of the invention do not include bsBAs that bind HER3 with one binding domain and that bind HER2/neu with a second binding domain.</p>DEFINITIONSUnits, prefixes, and symbols are denoted in their Systeme International de Unites (SI) accepted form.

Finally, in cases where receptor dimerization is required for signal transduction, the bsBA can act by preventing dimerization of the two cell surface receptors.</p>Selecting Cell Markers for Use as Targets and for EffectorsCell markers used for targeting bsBAs typically are expressed at higher levels on the target cell than on non-target cells, or are not expressed on non-target cells. For example, a target marker may be highly overexpressed in particular cancers compared to its expression in non-target cells, or may not be expressed by cells that are not cancerous.</p>The cell markers used as effectors are typically involved in cellular signaling, such as growth factor, cytokine, or chemokine receptors, that are beneficial to modulate in given pathological conditions. Because of the selectivity provided by the hi-lo bsBAs of the invention, the expression of the marker bound by the bsBA effector domain need not be confined to the target cell and may be expressed on other cells of the organism.</p>Measuring KdThe binding affinity of the binding molecules of the bsBA can be determined using methods known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,020, incorporated herein by reference. The binding affinity of the first and second binding molecules of the bsBA to their respective target receptors, and the off-rate of bsBA-receptor complexes, can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising incubating one or both receptors, labeled with, for example, <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I, with a bsBA of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled receptor, and detecting bsBA bound to the labeled receptor. The affinity of the bsBA of interest for a particular receptor and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by, for example, Scatchard plot analysis. The Kd may also be determined by flow cytometry as described, for example, in Nielsen et al. (Cancer Res. 60(22):6434-40 (2000)). An exemplary assay for determining Kd is set forth in the Examples.</p>In preferred methods, the receptor-binding affinities of the bsAb is determined from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a BIAcore surface plasmon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). Typically, the affinity of the bsBA to the ligand molecule is determined by immobilizing an appropriate amount (e.g., 500 resonance units) on a biosensor chip (BIAcore). On- and off-rates of the bsBAs are typically measured in PBS by injecting 25 \u03bcg/ml of the bsBA over the chip surface for 5 minutes and then allowing the bound material to dissociate for 5 minutes by flowing the buffer solution over the chip. Binding kinetics can be analyzed using, for example, BIAevaluation 2.1 software (BIAcore). For purposes of determining whether a particular bsBA falls within the scope of this invention, the affinities of the binding domains of the bsBA are determined after the bsBA is formed (as opposed to measuring the affinity of the domains individually prior to their placement in the bsBA) so that the relative affinity of the binding domains can be determined.</p>Measuring Desired Biological EffectsThe bsBAs of the invention are preferably first tested in vitro for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity. For example, in vitro assays that can be used to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of the bsBAs include the effect of a bsBA on a cell line or a patient tissue sample.</p>The effect of the bsBA on the c",

Therefore, a bsBA of the invention that targets the IGF-I receptor can be used to prevent or reduce the signal transduction via activation of the IGF-I receptor, and thereby treat estrogen-induced breast cancer disease conditions.</p>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a multifunctional cytokine that is induced by hypoxia and oncogenic mutations. VEGF is a primary stimulant of the development and maintenance of a vascular network in embryogenesis. It functions as a potent permeability-inducing agent, an endothelial cell chemotactic agent, an endothelial survival factor, and an endothelial cell proliferation factor (Thomas, J. Biol. Chem. 271:603-606, 1996; and Neufeld et al., FASEB J. 13:9-22, 1999). VEGF is an important factor driving angiogenesis or vasculogenesis in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including wound healing (Frank et al., 1995; Burke et al., 1995), diabetic retinopathy (Alon et al., 1995; Malecaze et al., 1994), psoriasis (Detmar et al., 1994), atherosclerosis (Inoue et al., 1998), rheumatoid arthritis (Harada et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1999), and solid tumor growth (Plate et al., 1994; Claffey et al., 1996).</p>A wide variety of cells and tissues produce VEGF. VEGF dimers bind with high affinity to two well-characterized receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT-1) and VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1), which are selectively expressed on endothelial cells (Flt-1 and Flk-1 are the mouse homologues). The Kd of VEGF binding to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 is 15-100 \u03bcM and 400-800 \u03bcM, respectively (Terman et al., 1994). A recently identified third cell surface protein, neuropilin-1, also binds VEGF with high affinity (e.g., Soker et al., Cell. 92(6):735-45 (1998)).</p>VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are members of the Type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK III) family that is characterized by seven extracellular IgG-like repeats, a single spanning transmembrane domain, and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain (Mustonen and Alitalo, J Cell Biol 129: 895-898 (1995)). Until very recently, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were thought to be almost exclusively expressed on endothelial cells (id.). Recent studies have shown that each of VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 are essential for vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and embryo development. VEGFR1 has a higher affinity for VEGF than VEGFR2, although it has a lower tyrosine kinase activity.</p>Binding of the VEGF dimer to the VEGF receptor is believed to induce receptor dimerization. Dimerization of the receptor then causes autotransphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, which leads to a signal transduction cascade. The intracellular events further downstream in VEGF-induced signaling are less clear, although a number of groups have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is produced after VEGF activation of VEGFR2 (Kroll and Waltenberger, Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 252(3):743-6 (1998)). Activation of VEGFR2, but not VEGFR1, by VEGF has also been shown to activate Src and the",
    "es/NetPhos/\u201d). Receptors with phosphorylation sites are more likely to be good effector markers since these are often involved in signaling. Alternatively, suitable effector markers may be identified by contacting target cells with antibodies to markers on the cell and then assaying for the desired biological activity as described above.</p>Example 4Testing Univalent and Bivalent Binding DomainsTo test the univalent affinity of the binding domains or of the bispecific binding molecule, bsBAs are produced as described above. To measure the binding kinetics by surface plasmon resonance, a biosensor chip can activated for covalent coupling of the receptor using N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the manufacturer's (BIAcore) instructions. The marker is then coupled e.g. by injection in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) to obtain a signal of ideally less than 400 response units (RU) of immobilized material. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of the univalent or bispecific binding domain is injected over the antigen chip in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate buffered saline) at 25\u00b0 C. using a flow rate of 20 \u03bcl/min. Dissociation data is then fit to a one-site model to obtain k<sub>off </sub>and the pseudo-first order rate constant (ks) can be calculated for each association curve, and plotted as a function of protein concentration to obtain k<sub>on</sub>+/\u2212s.e. Equilibrium dissociation constant, K<sub>d </sub>can then be calculated from SPR measurements as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. The absence of experimental artifacts, such as rebinding of dissociated bsBA, must be determined by performing above measurements on several surfaces of different densities, e.g., 100, 200, and 400 RU.</p>Alternatively, their affinities may also be determined by flow cytometry as described in, for example, Nielsen et al. (Cancer Res. 60(22):6434-40 (2000)).</p>Example 5Measuring Effector Function in CellsEffector function of a binding domain can be determined by contacting target cells grown in culture with the effector binding domain at different concentrations for e.g. 30 minutes. At this point the cells are in some cases stimulated with exogenous growth factor to promote the biological effect that the molecule seeks to alter. Extracts of the treated cells, grown in 6- or 12-well tissue culture plates, are prepared by passing cells 5 times through a 27G needle in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP40, 10 mM \u03b2-glycerolphosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1 \u03bcg/mL Leupeptin, 1 \u03bcg/mL Pepstatin) on ice. Before lysis, cells are washed twice in cold PBS. The lysates are then analyzed e.g. by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies: Total cell protein extracts (50 \u03bcg of total proteins/lane) is resolved by electrophoresis using 7.5% SDS-PAGE",
    "ation, such that the ErbB receptors become saturated with bsBA, results in a decrease in the inhibitory effect of the bsBA. This effect can be reversed by providing a bsBA that has an increased affinity of for ErbB2, such that the binding affinity of the bsBA is greater for ErbB3 than for ErbB4 (i.e., KdErbB3&gt;ErbB4).</p>The bsBAs discussed above are particularly efficient in a HRG dominated regime. In general the bsBAs are efficient at much lower doses compared to ErbB receptor inhibitors that target only one receptor.</p>Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is a bsBA in which one binding molecule of the bsBA has binding specificity for ErbB 1 (high affinity binding) and the other binding molecule has binding specificity for ErbB3 or ErbB4 (low affinity binding). In general, tumor cells express high amounts of ErbB1 (i.e., often greater than 100,000 receptors/cell), whereas the receptor expression for ErbB3 and ErbB4 ranges from between 5,000 to 20,000 receptors/cell. A bsBA that antagonizes ligand binding will successfully inhibit receptor signaling even though the receptor expression levels differ more than 10 fold.</p>Our in silico analysis confirms the effectiveness of a bispecific ErbB1/ErbB3 and ErbB1/ErbB4 bsBA. The inhibition of the ErbB3 receptor inhibits signaling in a HRG dominated regime.</p>Based on our in silico analysis of the ErbB cell signaling pathway, we identified the ErbB 1 binding molecule as the high affinity binding site with a low dissociation constant KD&lt;1 nM, but which is not irreversible. ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors are expressed at much lower levels than ErbB1 receptors. Because the bsBA binds to both ErB1 and ErbB3/ErbB4 receptors, and because the bsBA has a higher affinity for the more abundant ErbB1 receptor, the bsBA can effectively block cell signaling mediated by dimerization of ErbB1 with either ErbB3 or ErbB4 at a much lower concentration than conventional monospecific ErbB inhibitors. The high affinity of the bsBA for ErbB1 leads to a high efficiency at low bsBA concentrations.</p>Our approach takes advantage of computational modeling to identify the optimal receptors for cross linking as well as the desired affinities of the two binding molecules. The differential affinity of the two binding molecules of the bsBA effectively target the bsBA to receptors, such as ErbB3, that are not thought to be specific to cancer cells. Cross-linking ErbB3 to a more typical cancer antigen such as ErbB1 provides a means to specifically target cancer cells and to modulate ErbB3 receptor activity in these cells.</p>Using our computational model, we identified the necessity for the differential affinity of the two binding molecules of the bsBA. The differential affinity promotes stabilization of the bsBA trimer complex. Generally speaking, the active binding molecule of the bsBA should have the lower affinity compared to the inactive or less active binding molecule. If both binding molecules of the bsBA are inactive or less active, the binding molecule targeting the higher expressed or stronger signaling receptor should have the higher affinity. Having a differential affinity for one of the receptors targeted results in the following: if the bsBA is administered at a concentration above the Kd of higher affinity interaction (e.g. ErbB1), but below the Kd of lower affinity interaction (e.g. ErbB3) the bsBA should only accumulate onto cells expressing the antigen for the higher affinity interaction. The other end of the bsBA is available to interact with the low affinity antigen on these cells to interfere with its biological function (e.g. ErbB3; to prevent downstream signaling). Which receptor will be the low or high affinity interaction depends on the receptor's specific signaling strength (importance as a target) and the mode of action of the bsBA.</p>It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.
