    ".  Definitions</p>The term \"ligand\" means a compound capable of complexing a chemical element such as a metal, preferably a radioelement. According to one embodiment, the ligands within the meaning of the invention are in anionic form and can complex radioelements in cationic form, for example metal cations in oxidation state (III). According to the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) are ligands.</p>\u201cRadioelement\u201d means any known radioisotope of a chemical element, whether natural or artificially produced. According to one embodiment, the radioelement is chosen from among the radioisotopes of yttrium, actinium, copper, gallium, indium, scandium and lanthanides. The term \u201clanthanides\u201d denotes the atoms chosen from the group consisting of: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu.</p>The term \"alkylphenyl\" means a linear or branched alkyl radical, preferably comprising from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, bonded to a phenyl. Preferably, the alkylphenyl is an octylphenyl radical.</p>The term \"complex\" means the association of a ligand as defined above with a chemical element, preferably a radioelement as defined above. The term \u201ccomplex\u201d being synonymous with \u201cchelate\u201d.</p>\u201cThermodynamic stability\u201d represents the affinity of the ligand for a given element, in particular a given metal. This is the equilibrium constant of the following reaction</p>Metal + Ligand Complex  whose mathematical expressions are as follows:</p>Dissociation constant </p>Association constant </p>Values are usually expressed as a decimal logarithm logKa or -log of Kd. According to one embodiment, the complexes according to the invention are of high affinity. According to one embodiment, the complexes according to the invention have a thermodynamic equilibrium constant at least equal to 16 (LogKa at least equal to 16).  The complexes formed according to the equilibrium reaction described above are liable to dissociate under the action of various factors (pH, presence of competing metals or ligands). This dissociation can have important consequences in the context of the use of the complexes in human medicine because it leads to a release of the metal in the organism. In order to limit this risk, complexes with slow dissociation are sought, that is to say complexes having good kinetic inertia. The kinetic inertia can be determined by acid dissociation tests. These experiments lead to the determination for each complex of a half-life time (T 1/2) under defined conditions.</p>In the context of the invention, the term \"treating\", \"treatment\" or \"therapeutic treatment\" means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progression of, the disorder or the condition to which this term is applicable, or one or more symptoms of such a disorder.</p>The term \"medical imaging\" refers to the means of acquiring and restoring images of the human or animal body from various physical phenomena such as the absorption or emission of photons (visible, infrared, X-rays, gamma rays ) nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound wave reflection or radioactivity.
