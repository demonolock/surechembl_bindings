Compared with BMY7378 (KB=2.95 nM) affinity for this receptor is greater for the LDT derivative 5 and 8 (KB = 0.57 and 0.16, respectively, * P &lt;0.05).\n3. For the calculation of the Ki of the LTD's it was used the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where for prazosin (PZS) Kd values were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites of high and low affinity, respectively to \u03b11A adrenoceptor, and it was used Kd = 0.34 nM for \u03b11B-adrenoceptor.\n4. The Kd values of [3H]-prazosin to \u03b11A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and \u03b11B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol.

The Ki obtained values were summarized in the following tables 7 and 8, for example, LDT62 has a Ki value of 147 nM for 5-HT1A receptors.\n7. LDT8 has a Ki value of 23.7 pM for 5-HT1A receptors, which is significantly higher than the other derivatives (Table 7).\n8. The Ki value ratios for the states of low and high affinity of the receptor, by antagonist and agonist respectively, were close to the unity for the LDT's 3 and 8 (Table 13), suggesting that these derivatives are 5-HT1A antagonist receptor.\n9.
