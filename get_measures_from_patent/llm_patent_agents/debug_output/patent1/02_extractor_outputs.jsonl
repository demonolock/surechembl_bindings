We conducted experiments with BMY7378 50 nM, \u03b11D adrenoceptor antagonist used as positive control, and obtained a value of KB = 2.95 nM, consistent with the literature (CARROLL et al, Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 11:1119 - 1121, 2001).\n2. Compared with BMY7378 (KB=2.95 nM) affinity for this receptor is greater for the LDT derivative 5 and 8 (KB = 0.57 and 0.16, respectively, * P &lt;0.05).\n3. For the calculation of the Ki of the LTD's it was used the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where for prazosin (PZS) Kd values were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites of high and low affinity, respectively to \u03b11A adrenoceptor, and it was used Kd = 0.34 nM for \u03b11B-adrenoceptor.\n4. The Kd values of [3H]-prazosin to \u03b11A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and \u03b11B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol. Pharmacol., 48:250-258, 1995).\n5. LDT66, LDT68 and LDT69 derivatives (Ki equal to 43, 38 and 33 nM, respectively) showed affinity six to eight times higher (P &lt;0.01) than LDT62 (Ki = 261 nM) (Table 5).\n6. The Ki obtained values were summarized in the following tables 7 and 8, for example, LDT62 has a Ki value of 147 nM for 5-HT1A receptors.\n7. LDT8 has a Ki value of 23.7 pM for 5-HT1A receptors, which is significantly higher than the other derivatives (Table 7).\n8. The Ki values for LDT's 65-68 in \u03b12A receptors were in the range of 1.5-0.6 \u00b5M (Table 6).\n9. The Ki values for LDT's 62-70 and 39 in 5-HT2A receptors were in the range of 6.41-1.47 nM (Table 11).\n10. The Ki value ratios for the states of low and high affinity of the receptor, by antagonist and agonist respectively, were close to the unity for the LDT's 3 and 8 (Table 13), suggesting that these derivatives are 5-HT1A antagonist receptor.\n11. LDT3 (50 nM) and LDT66 (20 nM) inhibited the effect in face of the \u03b11D receptors and 5-HT1A receptors stimulus (Table 16)."}
