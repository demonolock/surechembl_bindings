The Kd values of [3H]-prazosin to α1A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and α1B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol.

By using prazosin non-radioactive as competitor agent to standardized curve competition for binding of 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin, the competition curve was biphasic in preparation of rabbit liver, approximately 2/3 of the sites labeled by 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin showing high affinity for prazosin (CI50 = 0.16 nM) and 1 / 3 had low affinity sites (CI50 1 nM).\n6.

The Ki obtained values were summarized in the following tables 7 and 8, for example, LDT62 has a Ki value of 147 nM for 5-HT1A receptors.\n8. The Ki value for LDT8 was 23.7 pM for 5-HT1A receptors, which is significantly higher than the other derivatives.\n9. The Ki values for LDT's 65-68 in α2A receptors were in the range of 1.5-0.5 µM (Table 6).\n10.
