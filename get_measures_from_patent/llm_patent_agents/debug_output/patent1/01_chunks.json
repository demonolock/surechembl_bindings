Then it was performed cumulative curves to \nphenylephrine\n (10-9 to 10-5 M) in the presence of \npropranolol\n 1 \u00b5M (\u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker receptors) before and after incubation for 1 hour of the LDT's at 10 or 50 nM. In parallel, a temporal control was performed to rule out any artifacts on the measured contraction, where was added only the vehicle (ultrapure water \nMilli\n Q \u00ae) instead of the substance to be tested. Strictly following the same protocol as the other tanks wherein it was added the LDT's.\nThe data were scanned in MacLab 8S system connected to the isometric tension transducer Grass FT-03, which recorded the voltage variation in milinewtons (mN) generated throughout the analysis. The digitized data were then analyzed by Chart 3.4 / s software program (MacLab, Inc., USA). In the pharmacological screening process, the initial concentration of the used LDT's was 50 nM, which is considered as cut concentration, i.e., substances that have no effect at this concentration would not investigated in this test. In contrast, the substances that were in effect, were then tested at lower concentrations (10 or 2 nM) (Table 2). Thus, by constructing concentration-response curves to the agonist PE in the absence and presence of the antagonist, it can be determined the maximum effect parameters (Emax) and the concentration which promotes Emax of 50% (EC50). The ratio of the EC50 value in these two conditions (with and without LDT) matches the third parameter, called \"concentration ratio\" (or RC). Once it has determined these parameters it is possible to calculate the apparent affinity of the competitive antagonist (KB) in vitro using the Schild equation (Eq. 1) (KENAKIN, Raven Press, New York. Pp :278-322, 1993). log\u2062CR-1=logB-log KB\n\n\nWhere CR = concentration ratio (EC'50 / EC50); [B] = 'B' antagonist concentration; KB = equilibrium dissociation constant of the antagonist 'B'.\nData analysis and statistical treatmentThe tension data were analyzed by non-linear regression to calculate the maximum effect parameters (Emax) and concentration which promotes Emax 50% (EC50) using GraphPad Prism software, version 4 (U.S.). To determine whether there was significant difference between the measurements taken before and after treatment with LDT's it was conducted single-factor ANOVA test followed by Newman-Keuls test, considering a 5% alpha risk (differences were considered significant if P &lt;0.05).\nFunctional Tests with prostateIsometric contraction assays were performed using Male Wistar rats, aged 2,5 - 3 months euthanized as described above. The male rat ventral prostate was removed and dissected into 10 mm segments. Then, each segment was fixed to a tension transducer (GRASS FT-03) and immersed in vats containing 9 ml of saline solution maintained at 37 \u00b0 C under constant aeration with \ncarbon mixture ( 95\n% 02 and 5% CO2). The segments were then subjected to a preload of 10 mN per 60 minutes. 1 \u00b5M Phenylephrine-induced contraction (PE) (\u03b11 adrenergic selective agonist) was performed. Then the preparation was washed and allowed to stand for 1 hour in order to recover the tissue. It was carried out cumulative curves to \nphenylephrine\n (10-8 - 10-3 M) in the presence of 1 \u00b5M \npropranolol\n (\u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker receptors) before and after incubation for 1 hour of the LDT's 3, 10 or 100 50 nM. In parallel, a time control was performed.\nData were digitized at MacLab 8S system connected to the isometric tension transducer Grass FT-03, which recorded the voltage variation in milinewtons (mN) generated throughout the analysis. The digitized data were then analyzed using Chart 3.4 / s software program (MacLab, Inc., USA). Thus, by constructing concentration-response curves to the agonist \nphenylephrine\n in the absence and presence of the antagonist it can be determined the parameters maximum effect (Emax) and the concentration that promotes Emax of 50% (EC50). The ratio of the EC50 value in these two conditions (with and without LDT) is the third parameter called \"concentration ratio\" (or CR). After this parameters were determined, it was possible to calculate the apparent affinity of the competitive antagonist (KB) in vitro using the Schild equation (KENAKIN, Raven Press, New York. Pp :278-322, 1993).\nStatistical AnalysisTo determine whether there was significant difference between the measured values it was performed an ANOVA single factor test followed by Newman-Keuls test, considering an alpha risk of 5% (differences were considered significant if P &lt;0.05).\nBinding assays (Binding)\u03b11A adrenoceptorsMembrane PreparationFollowing the protocol described previously in the literature, membrane preparations from rabbit liver homogenates were obtained. Such membrane preparations are enriched in adrenoceptor subtype \u03b11A. The tissue obtained as described above (\u223c 30 g) was naturally thawed, immersed in thawing solution (0.25 M \nsucrose\n, 1 mM \nEGTA\n and 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4)) freezing. Then, the tissue was transferred to a petri dish on ice containing solution for homogenizing liver (2 mM \nEDTA\n, 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4)) freezing. The liver was then carefully cut by ignoring the most fibrous part.\nThen, the material was transferred into a beaker where with the aid of Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (speed 24,000 RPM), the tissue was homogenized with the same buffer solution at a ratio of 6 parts of the solution to 1 part material. The material w",
    "ferent concentrations of nonradioactive \nprazosin\n (10-10 - 10-7 M). For competition assays, test tubes containing 350 \u00b5L of intermediate solution ([3H]-prazosin 0.16 nM, 1.6 mM \nEDTA\n, 50 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0C)) it was added the 50 \u00b5L of different concentrations of LDT's (end concentration 10-9 - 10-4 M) or 50 \u00b5L of water (solvent for dilution of LDT's) for the determination of total binding or 50 \u00b5L nonradioactive \nprazosin\n at 10 \u00b5M (end 1 \u00b5M) to the determination of nonspecific binding, and 200 \u00b5g of membrane preparations of rabbit liver (\u03b11A) contained in 50 \u00b5L suspension completing end volume of 500 \u00b5L. Assays were performed in triplicate.\nIn both assays, membrane preparations were incubated at 0\u00b0 C for 45 minutes. After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by rapid vacuum filtration on glass fiber filter (GMF 3 Filtrak \u00ae). The filters were washed four times with 4 ml of the same solution under vacuum to remove all free radioligand. Then the filters were dried and placed in vials containing 5 ml scintillation fluid (4% PPO, 0.1% \nPOPOP\n w / v in \ntoluene\n). The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR).\nSpecific binding of [3H]-prazosin to \u03b11A adrenoceptors was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. Data obtained by saturation experiment allowed us to obtain the parameters Kd (dissociation constant), which is the concentration of radioligand required to occupy 50% of the receptor sites and Bmax, maximum density of binding sites, which were calculated by non-linear regression. The increased values of bound were calculated indirectly by the value obtained for the concentration of bound radioligand (fmol / mg protein) which was multiplied by the dilution factor (DF) of radioligand (e.g. [3H]-prazosin) results from adding the nonradioactive ligand (e.g., \nprazosin\n), in a process known as isotope dilution. This procedure aims to obtain a saturation curve with less expenditure of radioactive substances and biological materials. Since competition assays allow us to construct inhibition curves of specific binding of radioligand. The higher the concentration of competitor agent employed in this case the LDT 's study, the greater the competition for specific receptors, decreasing the formation radioligand-receptor complex. This can be seen by the gradual decrease of radioactivity retained on the filters is detected by the counter liquid scintillation.\nFrom these curves it was possible to calculate the LDT's concentration values which inhibits 50% radioligand binding (IC50).These values were converted to Ki values (competitive dissociation constant at equilibrium or inhibition constant) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Eq. 2). Ki=CI501+L/Kd\n\n\nWhere Ki = inhibition constant; \nCI50\n = concentration inhibiting 50% radioligand binding; [L] = concentration of radioligand; Kd = equilibrium dissociation constant of the ligand (measured in saturation assay).\n\u03b11B adrenoceptors,Membrane PreparationFollowing the protocol described previously in the literature membrane preparations from rat liver homogenates were obtained. Such membrane preparations are enriched in the adrenoceptor subtype \u03b11B. The tissues obtained as described above (4 Rat livers corresponding to \u223c30 g) were thawed and homogenized perforated similarly performed for rabbit liver. The homogenate obtained was filtered through four layers of gauze and then subjected to centrifugation 5,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C, yielding a supernatant which was subsequently ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C, obtaining a pellet. This pellet was resuspended in buffer free of NaCl and subjected to a further ultrafiltration under the same conditions. The pellet obtained in this step was resuspended in storage solution (0.25M \nsucrose\n, 1mM \nEGTA\n TIIM and 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4)) with the aid of a manual type Dounce homogenizer and stored in aliquots of 300 \u00b5L in liquid \nnitrogen\n.\nBinding of [3H]-prazosin to \u03b11B adrenoceptorsBinding assays were standardized for \u03b11B adrenoceptors in the same way adrenoceptor binding assays for \u03b11A according to the literature, i.e. saturation and competition assays were performed on membrane preparations from rat liver, in this case using 150 g protein per tube contained 50 Ml suspension, in addition to various concentrations of LDT's (10-9 - 10-6 M).\n\u03b12 adrenoceptor",

The organs were homogenized in a Potter with the aid of a motor unit (Fisatom) and Teflon piston in the proportion of 20 parts of 50 mM \nTris HCl\n (pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0 C) for one piece of material, three times for 30 seconds each time, at intervals the solution was allowed to stand on ice for 1 minute.\nThen it was performed a centrifugation at 900 x g for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C. It was obtained a pellet which was resuspended in solution cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and the same procedure was performed once more. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C yielding a pellet which was resuspended at a ratio of 20 parts of 50 mM \nTris HCl\n (pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0 C) for one piece of material, and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes in order to remove the endogenous neurotransmitters. Finally, centrifugation two times more at 48,000 x g was performed for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C, and then the final pellet was resuspended in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4).\nBinding of the [3H]RX821002 to \u03b12 adrenoceptorsBinding assays for the \u03b12A receptor were performed as described previously in the literature and previously standardized in the laboratory by saturation experiments. The values of Kd and Bmax were 2.05 \u00b1 0.28 nM and 124 \u00b1 7 fmol / mg protein (n = 1), respectively. Incubate for 60 minutes at 30 \u00b0 C, 150 membrane preparation of rat cortex contained 50 \u00b5L was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl into tubes containing 400 \u00b5L intermediate solution ([3H] RX821002 1.25 nM, 50 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C) and 50 \u00b5L of different concentrations of LDT's (final concentration 10-7 - 3 x10-5 M to LDT65-68) or 50 \u00b5L of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C (solvent for dilution of the LDT's), to determine the total binding or 50 \u00b5L nonradioactive \nbitartrate adrenaline\n at 100 \u00b5M for determining the non-specific bounding (final volume 500 \u00b5L). Assays were performed in triplicate.\nAfter the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 mL ice cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4), followed by vacuum filtration on glass fiber filter (GMF 3, Filtrak \u00ae) previously soaked with solution 0.5% \npolyethylenoimine\n. The filters were washed three times with 4 mL of ice-cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4) under vacuum to remove all free radioligand. Then the filters were dried and placed in vials containing 5 ml scintillation fluid (composition: 4% PPO, 0.1% \nPOPOP\n w/v in \ntoluene\n). The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). Specific binding of [3H]RX821002 to \u03b12A receptors was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. To these receptors were determined and IC50 and Ki parameters.\nBinding of [3H]-QNB to muscarinic receptorsBinding assays for muscarinic receptors were performed as described in the literature (RICHARDS J Pharmacol 99, 753-761, 1990; CASTOLDI and cols., Life Sci. 78: 1915-1924, 2006). 150 g membrane preparations of rat cortex were incubated with 0, 1 radioligand nM [3 H]-QNB, in medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0 C) in the absence and presence of LTD's derivative (0.1 - 100 \u00b5M) for 60 min at 25 \u00b0 C. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u00b5M \natropine sulfate\n. Assays were performed in triplicate. The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). To these receptors were determined the IC50 and Ki parameters.\n5-HT1A receptorsMembrane PreparationMembrane preparations of rat hippocampus according to previously described by HALL et al (1985) and PEROUTKA (1986) were performed. The homogenization and centrifugation steps were performed identically to that described above for receptors \u03b12A and 5-HT2A receptors.\nBinding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT or [3H]p-MPPF to 5-HT1A receptorsThe binding assays for the 5-HT1A receptors were performed as described previously in the literature and previously standardized in the laboratory through saturation experiments. The values of Kd and Bmax were 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 nM and 125 \u00b1 42 fmol / mg protein, respectively (Neves et al., Bioorg Med. Chem. 18 (5): 1925-1935, 2010). It was incubate for 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C, 50 mg of membrane preparation of rat hippocampus, 50 \u00b5L contained in suspension in 50 mM Tris-HCl, into tubes containing 400 \u00b5l intermediate solution ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT 1.25 mM, 1.25 mM CaC12, 1.25 mM MnC12, 10 \u00b5M \npargyline\n (in order to protect the possible degradation of the radioligand by the monoamine oxidase enzyme (MAO), 50 mM \nTris\n (pH 7, 4, 37 \u00b0 C) addition of 50 \u00b5L different concentrations of LDT's (final concentration 10-10 - 10-6 M to LDT 2-6; 10-12 - 10-6 M to LDT 8, and 10-9 - 10-4 M to LTD 62-70 and LDT 39) or 50 \u00b5L of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C (solvent for dilution of LDT's) for the determination of total binding, or 50 \u00b5L non-radioative \nserotonin\n at 10 \u00b5M to determine the non-specific binding (final volume of 500 \u00b5L). Assays were performed in triplicate. Alternatively, incubated for 45 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C, 50 \u00b5g of membrane preparation of rat hippocampus contained in 50 \u00b5L suspension in 50 mM Tris-HCl, into tubes containing 400 Ml intermediate solution ([3H]p-MPPF 0.625 nM, 1.25 GTP, and 50 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C) in addition to 50 \u00b5L of different concentrations of LTD's (final concentration 10-9 - 3 x 10-7 M to 65-68 LDT) or 50 \u00b5L, Tris- HCl 50 mM pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C (solvent for dilution of LDT's) for the determination of total binding, and in the same manner as in binding of [3 H] 8-OH-DPAT, 50 \u00b5L nonradioactive \nserotonin\n at 10 \u00b5M for the determination of non-specific binding (final volume of 500 \u00b5L). Assays were performed in triplicate.\nAfter the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml of ice-cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4), followed by vacuum filtration on glass fiber filter (GMF 3, Filtrak \u00ae) previously soaked with solution 0.5% \npolyethylenoimine\n. The filters were washed three times with 4 mL of ice-cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4) under vacuum to remove all free radioligand. Then the filters were dried and placed in vials containing 5 ml scintillation fluid (composition: 4% PPO, 0.1% \nPOPOP\n w/p in \ntoluene\n). The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). Specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. For these receptors were also determined the LC50 and Ki parameters.\nIntrinsic activity at native 5-HT1A receptorsThe GTP presence displaces the GPCR to a state of low affinity (Lahti et al, 1992). The intrinsic activity of a substance can be estimated using GPCR agonist or antagonist radioligand appropriate to define the affinity of the substance in the state of high and low affinity receptor, respectively. Therefore, to determine the intrinsic activity of the more potent derivatives in 5HT1A receptors it was calculated their dissociation constants (Ki) using an antagonist as radioligand ([3H] p-MPPF) in the presence of a high concentration of GTP (Ki low) or an agonist ([3H] 8-OH-DPAT) in the absence of GTP (Ki high). Values for Ki ratio (Low Ki / High Ki) considerably greater than 1 (one) indicates agonism, whereas values close to 1 indicate antagonism while negative values indicate inverse agonism.\n[3H]-ketanserina binding to 5-HT2A receptorsThe binding assays for 5-HT2A receptors were performed as described in the literature. The values of Kd and Bmax obtained in previous laboratory experiments were 1.77 \u00b1 0.07 nM and 348 \u00b1 51 fmol / mg protein, respectively. Incubate for 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C, 150 \u00b5g of membrane preparation contained 50 \u00b5L of rat cortex suspension into tubes containing 400 \u00b5L intermediate solution ([3H]-ketanserin 1.25 nM, 125 nM \nprazosin\n , 50 mM \nTris\n, HCl IN up to pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C) in addition to 50 \u00b5L of different concentrations of LDT's (final concentration 10-10 - 10-4 M to LDT 2-4; and 10-8 - 10-4 to LDT 5-8) or 50 \u00b5L 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C (solvent for dilution of the LDT's), to determine the total binding, or 50 \u00b5L non-radioactive \nketanserin\n at 10 \u00b5M for the determination of nonspecific binding (final volume of 500 \u00b5L). Assays were performed in triplicate.\nAfter the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml of ice-cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4), followed by vacuum filtration on glass fiber filter (GMF 3, Filtrak \u00ae) previously soaked with solution 0.5% \npolyethylenoimine\n. The filters were washed three times with 4 mL of ice-cold solution containing 5 mM \nTris\n (pH 7.4) under vacuum to remove all free radioligand. Then the filters were dried and placed in vials containing 5 ml scintillation fluid (4% PPO, 0.1% \nPOPOP\n w / v in \ntoluene\n). The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). Specific binding of [3H]-ketanserin to the 5-HT2A receptor was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. To these receptors were also determined \nCI50\n and Ki parameters.\nD2-Like ReceptorsMembrane PreparationThe membrane preparation of rat striatum (receptor D2 - \"like\" - subtypes of \ndopamine\n receptors: D2 , D3 and D4) was performed according to literature description (Niznik et al, Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.. Pharmacol 329:333-343, 1985; Terai et al. Eur J Pharmacol 173:177, 1989; HAMDI et al, Life Sci 50, 1529-1534, 1992). Briefly, organs were homogenized for 30 seconds three times in Fisatom in 50 mM Tris-HCl, MgCl2 8 mM, 5 mM \nEDTA\n (pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0 C) and then centrifuged at 48,000 x gav (20 minutes 4 \u00b0 C). The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM \nEDTA\n (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0 C), incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes and centrifuged twice more. The final pellet was resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 1.5 mL / g tissue.\nD2-Like receptors binding assayD2-Like receptors binding assays were performed as described by our group (Neves et al., Bioorg. Med. 18 (5), 1925-1935, 2010). 50 \u00b5g rat striatal membranes were incubated for 60 min at 37 \u00b0 C in medium containing 0.1 nM of the antagonist radioligand [3H]-YM 09151-2, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mM MgC12, 1.5 mM CaC12, 1 mM \nEDTA\n and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 at 25 \u00b0 C) in the presence or absence of LTD's (0,003-30 \u00b5M). Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 30 \u00b5M \nsulpiride\n. Assays were performed in triplicate.\nThe radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). For these receptors were also determined IC50 and Ki parameters.\nProtein dosageThe dosage of the protein content of the samples was performed by the literature and proposed modified for microtiter plate (96 well plate) colorimetric method. To construct a standard curve used the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 250, 350 \u00b5g / mL. It was added 50 \u00b5L patterns of protein or 50 \u00b5L of dilute protein samples under study to each well containing 250 \u00b5L of a 2% \ndisodium carbonate\n in 0.1 N NaOH, 1% \ncupric sulphate\n and 2 % \nsodium potassium tartrate\n, 50 \u00b5L water (white). Finally, it was added 15 \u00b5L the Folin to each well and mixing with multichannel pipette. The plate was incubated for 45 min at room temperature from the homogenization of the first well. The absorbance values were obtained in plate spectrophotometer at a wavelength equal to 700 nm. The experiments were performed in triplicate using two different dilution factors. The calculation of the protein content of the samples was performed by interpolation using the values of the standard curve of absorbance versus protein concentration, which were analyzed by linear regression using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 program. Values are expressed in mg protein / ml homogenate.\nData analysis and statistical treatmentThe data obtained in binding assays were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (USA) in order to calculate the parameters of the competition curves, IC50, and the saturation curve, such as Kd and Bmax. Specially for the saturation experiments in the \u03b11A and \u03b11B adrenergic receptors one or two binding sites were tested, by choosing the one that best applies through the F test (DE LEAN et al., Mol Pharmacol. 21 (1) :5 it, 1982). Thus, when the sum of squares of errors was greatly reduced by assuming the model of the two opposite sites of a site model, the first model was used to obtain estimates of Kd values of \nprazosin\n. On the other hand, when no improvement was significant when adding a second site, it was obtained a single Kd value.\nThe difference between experimental groups was analyzed by single factor analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) followed by post hoc test of Newman-Keuls (more than 2 groups) considering in both cases P &lt;0.05.\nCell proliferation in vitro testHuman prostate cancer cells (DU-145) were cultured in medium (RPMI 1640) until confluence. Then the cells were dissociated, plated (5 x 103 cells / well) and maintained in medium free of fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. Then the cells were maintained and treated with 5-HT (1 \u00b5M) or \nphenylephrine\n (3 \u00b5M) in the absence or presence of LTD's (5, 50 or 500 nM) for 48 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by using the MTT technique (MOSMANN, T. Immunol Methods. 16;65 (1 -2) :55-63, 1983).\nAcute toxicity testSwiss mice (female, 25-30 g, 6 animals per condition) were treated with LDT via intraperitoneal with LTD's at a dose of 100 \u00b5g / kg and observed for 14 days in the behavioral framework according to described method (LORKE, D., Arch Toxicol, 54 (4):. 275 - 87, 1983, modified). The temperature was measured by retal probe before and after 30 and 60 min of described treatment.\nPhenylephrine-induced contraction inhibition in rat aortaAccording SCOFIELD et al (J. Pharmacol Exp Ther 275:. 1035-1042, 1995) as well as TESTA et al (Life Sci 57 (13). P1159-63, 1995), the rat thoracic aorta corresponds to a tissue expressing mainly \u03b11D-adrenoceptors in addition are enriched in serotoninergic receptors subtype 5-HT2A (Banes et al, J. Pharmacol ",
    "entration. Similarly, targeting to rule out any artifacts on the measured contraction, a time control was performed where only the vehicle was added (ultrapure Mili Q\u00ae water) in place of the substance to be tested, strictly following the same protocol as the other vats were added to the LDT ' s (Fig. 1).\nWe conducted experiments with BMY7378 50 nM, \u03b11D adrenoceptor antagonist used as positive control, and obtained a value of KB = 2.95 nM, consistent with the literature (CARROLL et al, Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 11:1119 - 1121, 2001). Within the series of LDT's 2-6 and 8, all substances, except LDT6, reduced the contraction induced by FE, also inducing a shift of concentration-response curves to FE to the right, quantified by the ratio of CE50 (CR). Thus, the data suggest an \u03b11D adrenergic antagonist effect for all derivatives studied, except LDT6.Thereafter the apparent affinity of antagonists was calculated (Table 1). The second experimental condition (LDT's 10 nM) was conducted only for the LDT 5 and 8 or 2 nM (LDT 245), to determine the affinity (KB) calculated from the Schild equation. The entire series LDT 2-8 except LDT6, showed great affinity for \u03b11D adrenoceptors. Compared with BMY7378 (KB=2.95 nM) affinity for this receptor is greater for the LDT derivative 5 and 8 (KB = 0.57 and 0.16, respectively, * P &lt;0.05).\nRegarding other derivatives LDT's 62-70 and 39, all concentration-response curves to \nphenylephrine\n suffered a classic right shift, quantified by the ratio of EC50 (CR) (Table 4), in the presence of LDT's relative the control curve, thus behaving as competitive antagonists. Among the antagonists N-phenyl \npiperazine\n varying the alkyl chain attached to position R1 (LDT ' s 63-68), and comparing them with the LDT62 derivative, there was a significant increase in relative affinity (KB) by \u03b11D-adrenergic receptors for LDT66 and LDT67 derivatives(Table 2), in which the alkyl chain ranging from six to seven carbons, respectively, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important for molecular recognition in this subtype of adrenergic receptor, which is consistent with the literature which describes the important role of hydrophobic forces in determining the affinity of \nN-phenylpiperazines\n or orto- \nmethoxyphenyl piperazines\n for the \u03b1 adrenoceptors.\nThe increase in hydrophobicity on LDT69, given by the substitution of R2 by an ethoxylated group did not alter the affinity to \u03b11D-adrenergic receptor relative to LDT62, wherein R2 is a methoxyl. Moreover, the inclusion of hydrophilic group donor and acceptor of \nhydrogen\n bond, or the substituent in R2 absence observed for LDT70 and LDT39, respectively, reduce affinity by \u03b11D - adrenergic receptors. The range of affinity of LDT's 66-68 for \u03b11D adrenoceptor is is equivalent to the affinity reported for other antagonists such as \nN-phenylpiperazine BMY7378\n and \nnaftopidil\n.\nTable 1: Affinity of the LDT's (2-6, 8, 245) and BMY7378 by the \u03b11D adrenoceptorsLDTLog CE50 \u00b1 EPM (M)CR\u00b1EPMlog KB \u00b1 EPM (M)KB (nM)NControlLDT2 a-7,00 \u00b1 0,19-5,65 \u00b1 0,1924,3 \u00b1 8,7-8,51 \u00b1 0,372,1553 a-6,87 \u00b1 0,25-5,40 \u00b1 0,2529,1 \u00b1 1,8-8,75 \u00b1 0,031,7854 a-6,99 \u00b1 0,19-5,79 \u00b1 0,3216,9 \u00b1 5,5-8,47 \u00b1 0,163,1455 b-7,12 \u00b1 0,22-5,85 \u00b1 0,1518,5 \u00b1 2,5-9,23 \u00b1 0,06 *0,5766 aNDNDNDNDND78 b-7,14 \u00b1 0,10-5,35 \u00b1 0,1462,5\u00b115,5-9,78 \u00b1 0,19 *0,1610245 c-6,72 \u00b1 0,09-6,23 \u00b1 0,143,9 \u00b1 1,0-8,93 \u00b1 0,191,167BMY7378b-6,99 \u00b1 0,15-6,36 \u00b1 0,094,4 \u00b1 0,8-8,53 \u00b1 0,112,956KB values individually calculated and obtained from the functional experiments in the presence of LDT OR BMY7378 at 50 nM, b10 nM or c2 nM.\nThe CR (ratio between the EC50 in the presence and absence LDTs) is the average of CRs calculated from EC50 obtained in the non-linear regression analysis.\n*P &lt; 0.05 compared to BMY7378 (single factor ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test).\nTable 2.

To adrenoceptor \u03b11A after analysis considering the binding of the radioligand to one or two specific binding sites, the best curve fit was obtained considering the two-site model. In this case it has a high affinity site corresponding to the \u03b11L type, and a second low affinity site, the \u03b11L, whose existence, nature and function are discussed in the literature. While for \u03b11B adrenoceptor at the best fit occurred in only one binding site model. By using \nprazosin\n non-radioactive as competitor agent to standardized curve competition for binding of 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin. Accordingly, the competition curve was biphasic in preparation of rabbit liver, approximately 2/3 of the sites labeled by 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin showing high affinity for \nprazosin\n (\nCI50\n = 0.16 nM) and 1 / 3 had low affinity sites (\nCI50\n 1 nM).\nKd values of [3H]-prazosin to \u03b11A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and \u03b11B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol. Pharmacol., 48:250-258, 1995). Concerning the LDTs, all series tested was able to inhibit specific bounding of the [3 H]-prazosin in competition assays.\nFor the calculation of the Ki of the LTD's it was used the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where for \nprazosin\n (PZS) Kd values were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites of high and low affinity, respectively to \u03b11A adrenoceptor, and it was used Kd = 0.34 nM for \u03b11B-adrenoceptor. The obtained Ki values are summarized in the following Tables 3 to 5 below.\nTable 3: pharmacological parameters of the LDT's (2-6 and 8) in the \u03b11A-adrenoceptorsLDTlog \nCI50\n \u00b1 EPM (M) aKi (M) bnHigh Affinity siteHigh Affinity site24-7,72 \u00b1 0,261,57 x 10-834-8,25 \u00b1 0,674,63 x 10-943-7,97 \u00b1 0,798,81 x 10-953-8,35 \u00b1 0,203,67 x 10-963-8,58 \u00b1 0,342,16 x 10-984-8,34 \u00b1 0,713,76 x 10-9PZS3-9,53 \u00b1 0,152,43 x 10-10a \nCI50\n values were calculated by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM;\nb Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation;\nP &lt;0.05 compared to the PZS (single-factor ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls).\nTable 4: Pharmacological Parameters of the LDT's (2-6, 8) \u03b11B adrenoceptorLDTnlog \nCI50\n \u00b1 EPM (M) aKi (M) b24-7,20 \u00b1 0,494,87 x 10-834-7,02 \u00b1 0,317,37 x 10-844-7,52 \u00b1 0,322,33 x 10-855-7,80 \u00b1 0,371,22 x 10-863-6,70 \u00b1 0,191,54 x 10-785-7,93 \u00b1 0,399,07 x 10-9a \nCI50\n values were calculated by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM;\nb Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation;\nTable 5: Pharmacological parameters of LDT' s (62-70 and 39) in \u03b11A and \u03b11B adrenoceptorLDT\u03b1 1A (n)\u03b1 1B (n)log IC50 (M)Ki (nM)log IC50 (M)Ki (nM)62-6,51 \u00b1 0,2261 (4)-6,27 \u00b1 0,05448 (3)63-6,50 \u00b1 0,08270 (4)-6,22 \u00b1 0,05511 (3)64-6,84 \u00b1 0,04124 (3)-6,33 \u00b1 0,16393 (3)65-7,10 \u00b1 0,0667 (3)-6,48 \u00b1 0,16277 (3)66-7,29 \u00b1 0,11 a43 (4)-6,51 \u00b1 0,18221 (4)67-7,02 \u00b1 0,12 a81 (3)-6,87 \u00b1 0,10113 (3)68-7,35 \u00b1 0,2 a38 (3)-6,69 \u00b1 0,10173 (3)69-7,41 \u00b1 0,25 a33 (3)-6,53 \u00b1 0,11185 (3)70-6,45 \u00b1 0,07304 (3)-6,07 \u00b1 0,10715 (3)39-6,36 \u00b1 0,21374 (3)-6,29 \u00b1 1,10425 (3)a \nCI50\n values were calculated by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM;\nb Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation;\nP &lt;0.01 compared to the LTD62 (single-factor ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls).\nAll LDT 2-8 group showed besides the ability to identify two binding sites, Ki values in the nanomolar range to the high affinity component (\u03b11A) similar to that observed for \nprazosin\n (Table 3). There was an increase in the affinity of the derivatives LDT65 to LDT69 compared to the LDT62 to the \u03b11A adrenoceptors. LDT66, LDT68 and LDT69 derivatives (Ki equal to 43, 38 and 33 nM, respectively) showed affinity six to eight times higher (P &lt;0.01) than LDT62 (Ki = 261 nM) (Table 5). Although LDT65 and LDT67 have Ki values from three to four times smaller (67 and 81 nM, respectively) compared to LDT62 this increase in affinity was not significant (P = 0.06 (LDT65) and 0.1 (LDT67)). There was no difference between affinity and LDT62 and LDT63 derivatives. LDT64, LDT39 and LDT70. For adrenoceptor \u03b11B, once again there was a lower affinity profile for LDT6 in the range \u00b5M when compared to the others, especially the LDT8, nanomolar range, but the difference was not significant. Thus, we see that the auxophoric substitution observed in LDT6 does not contribute to the upregulation of the apparent affinity for \u03b11 B / D adrenoceptor subtypes.\nThe LDT's 62-70 and LDT39 derivatives have lower affinity for \u03b11B-adrenoceptors in relation to the \u03b11A and \u03b11D receptors. Although none of the structural changes has significantly altered the affinity, there seems to be an increased affinity related to the increase of the alkyl chain from LDT65 derivative. Moreover, there also seems to have greater interaction when the ethoxylated group in the R2 \nphenylpiperazine\n subunit position present in LDT69 (also observed for LDT8) compared with the LDT62 methoxyl, using the same standard affinity receptors \u03b11A, but to a lesser degree. Mokrosz et al. (1997) found that only LDT's 66 and 68 are ligands of \u03b11-adrenergic receptor, however, it was not determined their affinity. Thus, we evaluate by what \u03b11 -adrenoceptor subtypes the LDT's would bind specifically and what would be its intrinsic activity in these subtypes. As for \u03b11D adrenoceptors it seems that hydrophobic interactions with alkyl chain good size are important requirements for molecular recognition of a receptor \u03b11A because the affinities (Table 6) were significantly higher for LDT66 and LDT68 derivatives, which have alkyl chain with 6 and 8 carbons, respectively.\nThe LTD's with size increase of the alkyl chain, more specifically LDT's 65-68 derivatives, LDT 66 and 68 are the most potent, are within the affinity range shown for most drugs in clinical use, which makes them new potential dual \u03b11 adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b11A and \u03b11d) which may be useful not only in relieving the symptoms of BPH but also to inhibit the proliferation of the prostatic tissue via \u03b11A adrenoceptor antagonism.\nA2A receptors - binding percentage of [3H] RX821002Previously performed by our group, saturation assays in rat cortex, where it was determined the binding parameters of [3H] RX821002 (Kd = 2.05 \u00b1 0.28 nM and Bmax = 124 \u00b1 7 fmol protein / mg) to \u03b12A receptors. This Kd value was used to calculate Ki of LDT's using Cheng-Prusoff equation.\nDuring competition assays, the LDT's 65-68 were able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H] RX821002 to \u03b12A adrenergic receptors, but with lower affinities (\u00b5M range, Table 5), as well as the \u03b1-1B adrenergic with respect to \u03b11A / 1D adrenergic receptors. The fact that these substances present a low affinity for this receptor is important for there is a high homology between \u03b12A adrenoceptor subtypes. Thus, the tested LDT's are likely to present little blocking of this \u03b12A adrenoceptor that is involved with the regulation of central nervous, cardiovascular and male genitourinary systems, by inhibiting the release of \ncatecholamines\n in these systems.\nTable 6: Pharmacological Parameters of the LDT's (65-68) in \u03b12A receptors.LDT\u03b1 2Alog IC50 (M)Ki (\u00b5M) (n)65-5,60 \u00b1 0,061,5(5)66-5,92 \u00b1 0,060,8(5)67-6,10 \u00b1 0,060,5(5)68-6,01 \u00b1 0,030,6(5)\nIC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as the mean \u00b1 EPM of (n) individual experiments; Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\nThe 5-HT1A receptors - binding percentage of [3H]-8-OH-DPATSaturation studies in rat hippocampal enriched tissue in 5-HT1A receptors were performed to determine the binding parameters of the [3H]-8-OH-DPAT (Kd = 0.7 nM \u00b1 0.1 nM and Bmax = 125 \u00b1 42 fmol / mg protein, n = 3), which is consistent with the literature (Neves et al, Bioorg Med Chem 18 (5): 1925-1935, 2010). This Kd value was used to calculate the Ki of the LDT's using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. The Ki obtained values were summarized in the following tables 7 and 8. In Competition assays all tested range was able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. In this receptor, the most prominent derivative was LDT8, which exhibited a very high affinity (Ki = 23.7 pM) compared to it, all other components of the range have significantly lower affinity although all with a high affinity in the nanomolar range.\nCompared to LDT62 (Ki = 147 nM), the LTD's 65-68 have 8-29 times higher affinities (Ki (nM) 18, 5, 18 and 9, respectively, P &lt;0.05). On the other hand, LDT63, LDT64, LDT69, LDT70 and LDT39 have similar affinities, with no statistically significant difference (P&gt; 0.05) between values of Ki and that of the LDT62 (Table 8).\nTable 7: Pharmacologicalparameters ofLDT's (2-6, 8, 245) for 5-HT1A receptors.LDTnlog \nCI50\n \u00b1 EPM (M) aKi (M) b24-8,52 \u00b1 0,03 **1,24 x 10-934-8,56 \u00b1 0,07 **1,13 x 10-944-8,62 \u00b1 0,13 **9,88 x 10-1054-8,21 \u00b1 0,05**2,54 x 10-964-9,23 \u00b1 0,24 *2,42 x 10-1083-10,24 \u00b1 0,712,37 x 10-112452-8,03 \u00b1 0,053,80 x 10-9a IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM;\nb Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation;\n* P &lt;0.01 and ** P &lt;0.001 compared to LDT 8 (single factor ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test).\nTable 8: Pharmacological Parameters LDT' s (62-70, 39) in the 5-HT1A.LDT5-HT1A (n)log IC50 (M)Ki (nM)62-6,47 \u00b1 0,10147 (3)63-6,37 \u00b1 0,03191 (3)64-6,72 \u00b1 0,1984 (3)65-7,42 \u00b1 0,09c18 (3)66-7,93 \u00b1 0,20a5 (4)67-7,42 \u00b1 0,19b18 (3)68-7,70 \u00b1 0,30b9 (3)69-6,86 \u00b1 0,3062 (3)70-6,15 \u00b1 0,08316 (4)39-5,93 \u00b1 0,13520 (3)IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM;\nKi values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation;\nP &lt;0.001, b P &lt;0.01 and c p &lt;0.05 compared to LDT 62 (single-factor ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test).\nIn another competition assay for 5-HT1A receptors, the LDT's 65-68 were capable of specific binding of the antagonist [3H]p-MPPF affinity in the nM range, as well as the agonist [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. The ratios of Ki values for the low and high affinity receptor states, by the agonist and antagonist, respectively, were close to unity (Table 9), suggesting that these four would derivatives act as antagonists of 5-HT1A receptors, which can be useful in inhibiting proliferation of prostate tissue occurring in BPH.\nTable 9. intrinsic activity estimative of LDT 65-68 in 5-HT1A receptors.LDTKi high (nM)Ki low (nM)Ki low / Ki high651821,21,186659,01,8067186,70,376893,10,34\nKi values were calculated using competition experiments with the agonist radioligand [3H] 8-OH-DPAT (high Ki) and the antagonist radioligand [3H] p-MPPF in the presence of GTP (lower Ki) in rat hippocampal membrane preparations.

Generally, compared to affinities of LDT's 2-6 and 8, LTD's 62-70 and LDT39 by all the studied receptors, the observed affinities for 5-HT2A receptors are the smallest, as occurs for the derivative with respect to LDT65 \u03b12A adrenergic receptors.\n\u03b12A receptors - Percentage of binding of [3H]RX821002In competition assays the LDT's were able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-RX821002 to the \u03b12A adrenergic receptor, but with lower affinities (\u00b5M range, Table 12). The fact that these substances present a low affinity for this receptor is important that there is a high homology between \u03b12A adrenoceptor subtypes. Thus, the tested LDT's are likely to present little blocking of this \u03b12A adrenoceptor which is involved with the regulation of central cardiovascular and nervous male genitourinary systems, by inhibiting the release of \ncatecholamines\n in these systems, reducing the likelihood of adverse effects.\nTable 12: Pharmacological parameters of the LDT's on \u03b12A receptors.LDT\u03b1 2A-log IC50 (M)Ki (\u00b5M) (n)35,96 \u00b1 0,090,9356,53 \u00b1 0,050,2486,22 \u00b1 0,120,552455,7 \u00b1 \n0,20,16\nCI50\n values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 EPM (n) individual experiments; Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n5-HT1A receptors - intrinsic activityThe Ki value ratios for the states of low and high affinity of the receptor, by antagonist and agonist respectively, were close to the unity for the LDT's 3 and 8 (Table 13), suggesting that these derivatives are 5-HT1A antagonist receptor. Therefore they can be useful in the proliferation inhibition of the prostate tissue that occurs in BPH.\nTable 13.

Additionally, blocking non-target receptors for the disease in question is related to an increased likelihood of adverse effects. Thus, in addition to \u03b12 adrenoceptor (already presented in this text, Table 12), we also conducted the investigation of the action of LDT's on muscarinic and dopaminergic D2 receptors. All LDT's showed a lower affinity for these receptors, and particularly LDT3 and LDT5 with Ki in micromolar range (Tables 14 and 15) in relation to the target receptors, i.e. \u03b11A, \u03b11D adrenoceptor and 5-HTIA receptors. Therefore these LDT's should have little propensity for adverse effects.\nTable 14: Pharmacological Parameters LDT's on muscarinic receptors.LDTmuscarinic-log IC50 (M)Ki (\u00b5M) (n)34,26 \u00b1 0,0756,7 (3)53,97 \u00b10,06108 (3)84,48 \u00b1 0,0733,9 (3)653,3 \u00b1 0,08172 (3)663,8 \u00b1 0,0854,2 (3)674,2 \u00b10,0221 (3)684,5 \u00b10,0510,8 (3)\nIC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as the mean \u00b1 EPM of (n) individual experiments; Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\nTable 15: pharmacological parameters of LDT's on D2 dopaminergic receptors.LDTD2-log IC50 (M)Ki (\u00b5M) (n)36,73 \u00b1 0,130,186 (3)57,05 \u00b1 0,040,1 (3)87,92 \u00b1 0,250,012 (3)2457,91 \u00b1 0,010,004 (3)656,88 \u00b1 0,050,04 (4)666,92 \u00b1 0,110,04 (4)677,47 \u00b1 0,070,009 (4)687,49 \u00b1 0,090,009 (4)\nIC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (USA) and expressed as the mean \u00b1 EPM of (n) individual experiments; Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\nProliferation assays using human prostate cells in vitroLiterature data show that prostate cells expressing the \u03b11A adrenoceptor, \u03b11D adrenoceptor and 5HT1A receptor, wherein \u03b11D adrenoceptor and 5HT1A receptor are related to cell proliferation (DIZEYI et al Prostate 59 (3):328-336, 2004; KOJIMA and cols., Prostate 66:761-767, 2006). In these models, \ntamsulosin\n does not inhibit cell proliferation (DIZEYI et al. Prostate 59 (3) :328-336, 2004).\nThe analysis of our data showed that the LDT's used in a nanomolar range of concentration in vitro inhibits the stimulation of tumor-origin human prostatic cell. In particular, LDT3 (50 nM) and LDT66 (20 nM) inhibited the effect in face of the \u03b11D receptors and 5-HT1A receptors stimulus (Table 16).\nTable 16.
