    "r human lysine demethylase enzyme called \nLysine Specific Demethylase-1\n (\nLSD1\n) was recently discovered (Shi et al. (2004) Cell 119:941) and shown to be involved in histone \nlysine\n methylation. \nLSD1\n has a fair degree of structural similarity, and \namino acid\n identity/homology to polyamine oxidases and \nmonoamine oxidases\n, all of which (i.e., \nMAO-A\n, \nMAO-B\n and \nLSD1\n) are \nflavin\n dependent \namine\n oxidases which catalyze the oxidation of nitrogen-hydrogen bonds and/or nitrogen-carbon bonds. Although the main target of \nLSD1\n appears to be mono- and di-methylated histone lysines, specifically H3K4 and H3K9, there is evidence in the literature that \nLSD1\n can demethylate methylated lysines on non-histone proteins like p53, E2F1, Dnmt1 and STAT3.\nSeveral groups have reported \nLSD1\n \ninhibitors\n in the literature. Sharma et al. recently reported a new series of \nurea\n and \nthiourea\n analogs based on an earlier series of polyamines which were shown to inhibit \nLSD1\n and modulate histone methylation and gene expression in cells (J. Med. Chem. 2010 PMID: 20568780 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]). Sharma et al. note that \u201cTo date, only a few existing compounds have been shown to inhibit \nLSD1\n.\u201d Some efforts were made to make analogs of the histone peptide that is methylated by the enzyme, other efforts have focused on more small molecule like molecules based on known MAO inhibitors. Gooden et al. reported \ntrans-2-arylcyclopropylamine\n analogues that inhibit LSD1 with Ki values in the range of 188-566 micromolar (Gooden et al. ((2008) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 18:3047-3051)). Most of these compounds were more potent against MAO-A as compared to MAO-B. Ueda et al. ((2009) J. Am. Chem Soc. 131(48):17536-17537) reported \ncyclopropylamine\n analogs selective for LSD1 over MAO-A and MAO-B that were designed based on reported X-ray crystal structures of these enzymes with a \nphenylcyclopropylamine-FAD\n adduct and a FAD-N-propargyl \nlysine\n peptide; the reported IC50 values for \nphenylcyclopropylamine\n were about 32 micromolar for LSD1 whereas compounds 1 and 2 had values of 2.5 and 1.9 micromolar respectively.\nImportantly, studies have also been conducted on amine oxidase inhibitor compounds to determine selectivity for MAO-A versus MAO-B since MAO-A inhibitors can cause dangerous side-effects (see e.g., Yoshida et. al. (2004) Bioorg. Med Chem. 12(10):2645-2652; Hruschka et al. (2008) Biorg Med Chem. (16):7148-7166; Folks et al. (1983) J. Clin. Psychopharmacol. (3)249; and Youdim et al. (1983) Mod. Probl. Pharmacopsychiatry (19):63).\nCurrently, the treatments available for myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders and related diseases have serious drawbacks.

The inventors have unexpectedly found that inhibitors of LSD1 reduce platelets and other blood cells and can therefore be used for the treatment or prevention of myeloproliferative disorders or related diseases or lymphoproliferative disorders or related diseases.

    "xide/peroxidase-coupled assay kit (Invitrogen).\nBriefly, a fixed amount of LSD1 was incubated on ice for 15 minutes, in the absence and/or in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (e.g., from 0 to 75 \u03bcM, depending on the inhibitor strength). \nTranylcypromine\n (Biomol International) was used as a control for inhibition. Within the experiment, each concentration of inhibitor was tested in triplicate. After leaving the enzyme interacting with the inhibitor, 12.5 \u03bcM of di-methylated H3-K4 peptide was added to each reaction and the experiment was left for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. in the dark. The enzymatic reactions were set up in a 50 mM \nsodium phosphate\n, pH 7.4 buffer. At the end of the incubation, Amplex\u00ae Red reagent and horseradish peroxidase (HPR) solution were added to the reaction according to the recommendations provided by the supplier (Invitrogen), and left to incubate for 30 extra minutes at room temperature in the dark. A 1 \u03bcM H2O2 solution was used as a control of the kit efficiency. The conversion of the Amplex\u00ae Red reagent to \nresorufin\n due to the presence of H2O2 in the assay, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 540 nm, emission at 590 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure level of H2O2 produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.\nThe maximum demethylase activity of LSD1 was obtained in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of LSD1. The Ki (IC50) of each inhibitor was estimated at half of the maximum activity.\nHuman recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. \n3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine\n (\nkynuramine dihydrobromide\n, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. \nKynuramine\n is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, \nkynuramine\n is converted into \n4-hydroxyquinoline\n (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.\nThe monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of \nkynuramine\n into \n4-hydroxyquinoline\n. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL. The assay buffer was 100 mM \nHEPES\n, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in triplicate within the same experiment.\nBriefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 \u03bcg for MAO-A and 0.5 \u03bcg for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (e.g., from 0 to 50 \u03bcM, depending on the inhibitor strength). \nTranylcypromine\n (Biomol International) was used as a control for inhibition.\nAfter leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, 60 to 90 \u03bcM of \nkynuramine\n was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL (v/v) of NaOH 2N. The conversion of \nkynuramine\n to \n4-hydroxyquinoline\n, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.\nThe maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of \n4-hydroxyquinoline\n formed from \nkynuramine\n deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes. The Ki (IC50) of each inhibitor was determined at Vmax/2.\nExample 2LSD1 and LSD1/MAO-B Dual InhibitorsTABLE 1Exemplary IC50 values for selected compoundsagainst LSD1, MAO-A, and MAO-B.LSD1MAO-AMAO -BCompound No.IC50 (uM)IC50 (uM)IC50 (uM)Compound 1&lt;0.20&gt;2&lt;0.20Compound 2&lt;0.20&gt;2&lt;0.20Compound 3&lt;0.10&gt;2&gt;2Compound 4&lt;0.10&gt;2&gt;2Compound 5&lt;0.20&gt;0.5&gt;1Compound 6&lt;0.07&gt;1&gt;1Compound 7&lt;0.07&gt;2&gt;2Compound 8&lt;0.07&gt;1&gt;10\nCompounds 1-8 are \nphenylcyclopropylamine\n derivatives or analogs as in WO2010/043721 (PCT/EP2009/063685), WO2010/084160 (PCT/EP2010/050697), PCT/EP2010/055131; PCT/EP2010/055103; and EP applications number EP10171345, EP10187039 and EP10171342.\nCompound 1 corresponds to\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2011/042217.\nCompound 2 corresponds to the \n(1R,2S) isomer\n of compound 1 and can be prepared following the methods disclosed in WO 2011/042217.\nCompound 3 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2010/043721.\nCompound 4 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2011/035941.\nCompound 5 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2012/013727.\nCompound 6 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2012/013727.\nCompound 7 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2012/013727.\nCompound 8 is\n\n\nand can be prepared as disclosed in WO 2012/013727.\nExample 3LSD1 and LSD1/MAO-B Dual Inhibitors Increase Histone \nLysine\n Methylation in Cell Based AssaysHistone from SH-SYSY cells grown in the presence of Compound Dual-1 (a dual LSD1/MAOB inhibitor)(Compound 1 in Example 2 above) or \ntranylcypromine\n (\nparnate\n) for 1, 2, and 3 days were extracted and subjected to western blot analysis using a commercially available antibody specific for"
