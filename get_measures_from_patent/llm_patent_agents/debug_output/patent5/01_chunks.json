    "% of the TH+ neurons at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg/d). Moreover, the enantiomeric specificity observed in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease mirrored that observed in the mouse model of\n\nneurogenesis. Specifically, (-)-P7C3-S243 was strongly protective while the (+)-enantiomer was indistinguishable from vehicle treatment under the conditions of the assay. In this side-by-side experiment, P7C3-S243 appears at least as effective as P7C3-A20, a compound that has proven efficacy in several animal models of neurodegenerative disease.\nThe pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of P7C3-S243 were evaluated using both in vivo and in vitro methods. Having observed near complete metabolic stability in the presence of murine hepatocytes (Ti/2 &gt; 240 min), we monitored plasma and brain levels of the compound following IV, oral and IP dosing. As shown in Table 1, P7C3-S243 showed a dose-proportional increase in brain levels following IP dosing. Plasma bioavailability was higher via IP dosing compared to PO, but partitioning into the brain was superior when the compound was administered by oral gavage. We have noted the same effect with P7C3-A20, and thus comparable brain levels are achieved by either IP or oral gavage. By all routes of administration, P7C3-S243 was metabolically stable. -S243\n\n\nIP 10 189\u00b135 66/28 0.45 &gt;24\nIP 20 319\u00b168 90/48 0.28 15\nPO 20 388\u00b129 38/58 0.81 9.6\n\u00b0mean\u00b1SEM.\n(-)-P7C3-S243 did not show significant toxicity towards 3 human cancer cell lines tested (IC50 &gt; 10 \u03bc\u039c vs H2122, H2009 and HCC44). Likewise, we observed &lt;15% inhibition of the hERG channel at 50 \u03bc\u039c using a patch clamp assay. Several cytochrome P450's were insensitive to (-)-P7C3-S243 (3A4,\n2C9, 3D6, 2C8, 2B6) while CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 showed modest IC50 values of 20 and 1.9 \u03bc\u039c, respectively. Given the high protein binding of P7C3-S243, free concentrations of drug are unlikely to reach those concentrations. Finally, (-)-P7C3-S243 was screened through the NIH's Psychoactive\nDrug Screening Program, and no compelling binding partners were identified. Of 47 neuronal\n\nreceptors and channels tested, only the \u03bc-opioid receptor (IC50 = 8.2 \u03bc\u039c) and the peripheral \nbenzodiazepine\n receptor (also known as translocator protein, TSPO, IC50 = 0.35 \u03bc\u039c) showed any ligand displacement. The binding affinity of the former is clearly too weak to be causative for the biological activity we observe, provided that the in vitro data are predictive of binding in vivo. The relevance of binding to TSPO is less clear, however. While total brain concentration remains in the low \u03bc\u039c range for several hours after dosing, free concentration is much lower. Moreover, while we see enantiomeric specificity in the neurogenesis (FIG. 2) and MPTP assays (FIG. 3), both enantiomers of P7C3-S243 bind TSPO with similarly weak affinity (0.35 and 0.68 \u03bc\u039c). A wide structural range of chemicals have been found to bind TSPO, from the eponymous \nbenzodiazapines\n to \ncholesterol\n to \nporphyrins\n/\"* suggesting that it might represent a non-specific binding partner for small molecules. Finally, a tight binding inhibitor of this protein showed no toxicity in phase I and II clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and is currently in phase II trials for spinal muscular atrophy.xx Overall, the clean receptor binding results (not shown) are consistent with our observation that long-term treatment with P7C3-A20 (up to 40 mg/kg/d for 21 d) or P7C3-S243 (up to 10 mg/kg/d for 21 d) has no negative impact on weight, behavior or appearance of treated animals.\nWe have discovered a novel class of potent neuroprotective agents known as the P7C3 series of \naminopropyl carbazoles\n. We have now synthesized and characterized an optimized member of this "
