FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of diseases and disorder associated with 
myeloproliferative
 and 
lymphoproliferative disorders
. The invention also relates to an 
LSD1
 
inhibitor
 for use in treating or preventing diseases and disorders associated with myeloproliferative and 
lymphoproliferative disorders
.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMyeloproliferative and 
lymphoproliferative disorders
 in humans are a major health problem.
Myeloproliferative
 and 
lymphoproliferative disorders
 are characterized as a group of diseases related to abnormal proliferation of blood cells produced in bone marrow.
Myeloproliferative disorders
 include Philadelphia chromosome positive and Philadelphia chromosome negative categories. Clinically, Philadelphia chromosome positive myeloproliferation is associated with 
leukemias
 like 
chronic myelogenous leukemia
 (CML) and occasionally in 
acute myelogenous leukemia
 (AML) and in related diseases of the lymphoproliferation in respective lineages like 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia
 (ALL).
A group of enzymes known as 
lysine methyl
 transferases and 
lysine
 demethylases are involved in histone 
lysine
 modifications. One particular human lysine demethylase enzyme called 
Lysine Specific Demethylase-1
 (
LSD1
) was recently discovered (Shi et al. (2004) Cell 119:941) and shown to be involved in histone 
lysine
 methylation. 
LSD1
 has a fair degree of structural similarity, and 
amino acid
 identity/homology to polyamine oxidases and 
monoamine oxidases
, all of which (i.e., 
MAO-A
, 
MAO-B
 and 
LSD1
) are 
flavin
 dependent 
amine
 oxidases which catalyze the oxidation of nitrogen-hydrogen bonds and/or nitrogen-carbon bonds. Although the main target of 
LSD1
 appears to be mono- and di-methylated histone lysines, specifically H3K4 and H3K9, there is evidence in the literature that 
LSD1
 can demethylate methylated lysines on non-histone proteins like p53, E2F1, Dnmt1 and STAT3.
Several groups have reported 
LSD1
 
inhibitors
 in the literature. Sharma et al. recently reported a new series of 
urea
 and 
thiourea
 analogs based on an earlier series of polyamines which were shown to inhibit 
LSD1
 and modulate histone methylation and gene expression in cells (J. Med. Chem. 2010 PMID: 20568780 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]). Sharma et al. note that “To date, only a few existing compounds have been shown to inhibit 
LSD1
.” Some efforts were made to make analogs of the histone peptide that is methylated by the enzyme, other efforts have focused on more small molecule like molecules based on known MAO inhibitors. Gooden et al. reported 
trans-2-arylcyclopropylamine
 analogues that inhibit LSD1 with Ki values in the range of 188-566 micromolar (Gooden et al. ((2008) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 18:3047-3051)). Most of these compounds were more potent against MAO-A as compared to MAO-B. Ueda et al. ((2009) J. Am. Chem Soc. 131(48):17536-17537) reported 
cyclopropylamine
 analogs selective for LSD1 over MAO-A and MAO-B that were designed based on reported X-ray crystal structures of these enzymes with a 
phenylcyclopropylamine-FAD
 adduct and a FAD-N-propargyl 
lysine
 peptide; the reported IC50 values for 
phenylcyclopropylamine
 were about 32 micromolar for LSD1 whereas compounds 1 and 2 had values of 2.5 and 1.9 micromolar respectively.
Importantly, studies have also been conducted on amine oxidase inhibitor compounds to determine selectivity for MAO-A versus MAO-B since MAO-A inhibitors can cause dangerous side-effects (see e.g., Yoshida et. al. (2004) Bioorg. Med Chem. 12(10):2645-2652; Hruschka et al. (2008) Biorg Med Chem. (16):7148-7166; Folks et al. (1983) J. Clin. Psychopharmacol. (3)249; and Youdim et al. (1983) Mod. Probl. Pharmacopsychiatry (19):63).
Currently, the treatments available for myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders and related diseases have serious drawbacks. There is a need for new drugs for these diseases that target novel points of intervention in the disease processes and avoid side-effects associated with certain targets.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the treatment or prevention of hematological cancers, and in particular myeloproliferative disorders or a related disease (e.g., caused by myeloproliferation) or lymphoproliferative disorders or a related disease (e.g., caused by lymphoproliferation). The inventors have unexpectedly found that inhibitors of LSD1 reduce platelets and other blood cells and can therefore be used for the treatment or prevention of myeloproliferative disorders or related diseases or lymphoproliferative disorders or related diseases. The finding was unexpected since LSD1 inhibition is shown to have specific effect on reducing platelets and other blood cells in animal studies. Furthermore, studies by the inventors with myeloproliferative cell lines indicate activity in this setting. Advantageously, the use of selective LSD1 inhibitors or dual LSD1/MAOB inhibitors avoid side-effects associated with targets such as MAOA. The inventors found that administration of LSD1 inhibitors chronically was well tolerated in mammals (selective and dual LSD1/MAOB inhibitors). Thus, the inventors have unexpectedly found that LSD1 inhibition, selective LSD1 inhibition or LSD1/MAOB dual inhibition represent a new therapeutic approach to treating or preventing myeloproliferative disorders or related diseases or lymphoproliferative disorders or related diseases.
The present invention provides for the treatment or prevention of cancer, or a related disease, caused by myeloproliferation. In particular, the invention provides compositions and methods that can be used to reduce platelets or other blood cells and medical benefits derived therefrom.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the treatment or prevention of hematological cancers, and in particular myeloproliferative disorders or related disease (e.g., caused by myeloproliferation) or lymphoproliferative disorders or a related disease (e.g., caused by lymphoproliferation). The inventors have unexpectedly found that inhibitors of LSD1 reduce platelets and other blood cells and can therefore be used for the treatment or prevention of myeloproliferative disorders or related diseases or lymphoproliferative disorders or related diseases. The finding was unexpected since LSD1 inhibition is shown to have specific effect on reducing platelets and other blood cells in animal studies. Thus, the methods and compositions of the invention can be useful for treating myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders where the individual is resistant to or not effectively treated by current medications or that cannot comply with the treatment regimes employed with current medications. Additionally, the methods and compositions of the present invention can be useful for treating or preventing Philadelphia chromosome positive myeloproliferation in combination with other anti-myeloproliferative agents or anti-lymphoproliferative agents used in this clinical setting. Other advantages and more details of the invention are described below.
A medicinal chemistry effort undertaken by some of the inventors resulted in the synthesis and identification of small molecule, potent selective LSD1 inhibitors and potent dual inhibitors of LSD1 and MAOB. This effort resulted in the identification of a number of compounds having different selectivities for LSD1, MAOA, and MAOB. See FIG. 1.
Subsequent studies of some of the optimized compounds in a neural derived cell line and other cell lines indicted that both selective LSDI inhibitors and dual inhibitors of LSDI and MAOB can increase histone methylation levels at the cellular level indicating that these compounds inhibit cellular lysine demethylase activity. Furthermore, these LSDI inhibitors show dose dependent effects on gene expression levels in these cells.
Lastly the LSD1 inhibitors were to be able to be administered to mammals chronically at doses that are thought to achieve levels of the inhibitor sufficient for causing a biological effect.
As a result of these studies, a number of LSD1 inhibitors were shown to have activity in reducing platelets and other blood cells in vivo . Without being bound by theory, it is believed that LSD1 inhibitors, including 
2-cyclylcyclopropan-1-amine
 compounds, 
phenelzine
 compounds, 
propargylamine
 compounds and other LSD1 inhibitors, inhibit platelet and blood cell proliferation and have use for treating or preventing hematological cancers associated with a myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorder or a related disease. More specifically, it is believed that LSD1 inhibitors, as a result of this invention, have use in treating or preventing cancers like myeloma, leukemia, or lymphoma.

As illustrated in the appended examples, the compounds of the present invention are surpassingly capable of reducing cell count/cell levels, in particular of blood cells and most particular of platelets. Accordingly, the LSD1 inhibitors as provided herein are useful in reducing (blood) cell counts/levels, in particular in reducing counts/levels of platelets. A “reduction in count/level” in this respect can be measured by means and methods provided herein and in the appended examples. A “reduction in (blood) cell and/or platelet levels” and/or a “reduction (blood) cell and/or platelet counts” can comprise the measurement of a given biological samples, like a blood sample, derived from a patient in need of medical intervention as provided herein in comparison to a given control sample or control samples or as compared to standard references or standard reference values. Such a control sample or such control samples may comprise corresponding samples from healthy individuals or from defined diseased individuals (for example individuals suffering from or being prone to suffer from hematological cancers like myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders. Such a control sample may also comprise a biological sample from the same individual to be assessed (like the patient) whereby said sample was taken at an earlier or a later stage when said individual was or is healthy or diseased (i.e. before, during or after medical intervention as disclosed herein). In context of this invention the “platelet reduction” to be achieved with the compounds of the present invention is a reduction of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30% or more as compared to a control sample or as compared to standard references or standard reference values.”0

Typically, compounds for use as LSD1 inhibitors, selective LSD1 inhibitors or dual inhibitors of LSD1 and MAOB can be effective at an amount of from about 0.01 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg per day based on total body weight. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at predetermined intervals of time. The suitable dosage unit for humans for each administration can be, e.g., from about 1 μg to about 2000 mg, preferably from about 5 μg to about 1000 mg, and even more preferably from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg. The active ingredient can be administered orally or by other routes of administration e.g., IP, TV, etc. Preferably, the inhibitor is formulated and delivered in such a way as to achieve concentration in vivo that modulate the target activity e.g., LSD1 and/or MAOB. Thus, in a specific embodiment, the effective amount of compound ranges from 0.05 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg per day based on total body weight, preferably from 0.05 μg/kg to about 50 mg/kg.
It should be understood that the dosage ranges set forth above are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope of this invention unless specified. The therapeutically effective amount for each active compound can vary with factors including but not limited to the activity of the compound used, stability of the active compound in the patient's body, the severity of the conditions to be alleviated, the total weight of the patient treated, the route of administration, the ease of absorption, distribution, and excretion of the active compound by the body, the age and sensitivity of the patient to be treated, and the like, as will be apparent to a skilled artisan. The amount of administration can be adjusted as the various factors change over time.
For oral delivery, the active compounds can be incorporated into a formulation that includes pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as binders (e.g., gelatin, cellulose, gum tragacanth), excipients (e.g., starch, 
lactose
), lubricants (e.g., 
magnesium stearate
, 
silicon dioxide
), disintegrating agents (e.g., alginate, Primogel, and corn starch), and sweetening or flavoring agents (e.g., 
glucose
, 
sucrose
, 
saccharin
, 
methyl salicylate
, and peppermint). The formulation can be orally delivered in the form of enclosed gelatin capsules or compressed tablets. Capsules and tablets can be prepared in any conventional techniques. The capsules and tablets can also be coated with various coatings known in the art to modify the flavors, tastes, colors, and shapes of the capsules and tablets. In addition, liquid carriers such as fatty oil can also be included in capsules.
Suitable oral formulations can also be in the form of suspension, syrup, chewing gum, wafer, elixir, and the like. If desired, conventional agents for modifying flavors, tastes, colors, and shapes of the special forms can also be included. In addition, for convenient administration by enteral feeding tube in patients unable to swallow, the active compounds can be dissolved in an acceptable lipophilic vegetable oil vehicle such as olive oil, corn oil and safflower oil.
The active compounds can also be administered parenterally in the form of solution or suspension, or in lyophilized form capable of conversion into a solution or suspension form before use. In such formulations, diluents or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as sterile water and physiological saline buffer can be used. Other conventional solvents, pH buffers, stabilizers, anti-bacteria agents, surfactants, and antioxidants can all be included. For example, useful components include 
sodium chloride
, 
acetates
, 
citrates
 or phosphates buffers, 
glycerin
, 
dextrose
, fixed oils, 
methyl parabens
, 
polyethylene glycol
, 
propylene glycol
, 
sodium bisulfate
, 
benzyl alcohol
, 
ascorbic acid
, and the like. The parenteral formulations can be stored in any conventional containers such as vials and ampoules.
Routes of topical administration include nasal, bucal, mucosal, rectal, or vaginal applications. For topical administration, the active compounds can be formulated into lotions, creams, ointments, gels, powders, pastes, sprays, suspensions, drops and aerosols. Thus, one or more thickening agents, humectants, and stabilizing agents can be included in the formulations.
Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, 
polyethylene glycol
, 
sorbitol
, 
xanthan
 gum, petrolatum, beeswax, or mineral oil, lanolin, 
squalene
, and the like. A special form of topical administration is delivery by a transdermal patch. Methods for preparing transdermal patches are disclosed, e.g., in Brown, et al. (1988) Ann. Rev. Med. 39:221-229 which is incorporated herein by reference.
Subcutaneous implantation for sustained release of the active compounds may also be a suitable route of administration. This entails surgical procedures for implanting an active compound in any suitable formulation into a subcutaneous space, e.g., beneath the anterior abdominal wall. See, e.g., Wilson et al. (1984) J. Clin. Psych. 45:242-247. Hydrogels can be used as a carrier for the sustained release of the active compounds. Hydrogels are generally known in the art. They are typically made by crosslinking high molecular weight biocompatible polymers into a network, which swells in water to form a gel like material. Preferably, hydrogels are biodegradable or biosorbable. For purposes of this invention, hydrogels made of 
polyethylene glycols
, collagen, or 
poly(glycolic-co-L-lactic acid)
 may be useful. See, e.g., Phillips et al. (1984) J. Pharmaceut. Sci., 73: 1718-1720.
The active compounds can also be conjugated, to a water soluble non- immunogenic non-peptidic high molecular weight polymer to form a polymer conjugate. For example, an active compound is covalently linked to 
polyethylene glycol
 to form a conjugate. Typically, such a conjugate exhibits improved solubility, stability, and reduced toxicity and immunogenicity. Thus, when administered to a patient, the active compound in the conjugate can have a longer half-life in the body, and exhibit better efficacy. See generally, Burnham (1994) Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 15:210-218. PEGylated proteins are currently being used in protein replacement therapies and for other therapeutic uses. For example, PEGylated interferon (PEG-INTRON A®) is clinically used for treating Hepatitis B. PEGylated adenosine deaminase (ADAGEN®) is being used to treat severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCIDS). PEGylated L-asparaginase (ONCAPSPAR®) is being used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is preferred that the covalent linkage between the polymer and the active compound and/or the polymer itself is hydrolytically degradable under physiological conditions. Such conjugates known as “prodrugs” can readily release the active compound inside the body. Controlled release of an active compound can also be achieved by incorporating the active ingredient into microcapsules, nanocapsules, or hydrogels generally known in the art. Other pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, 
esters
, 
carbonates
, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, 
N-acyloxyalkyl
 derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, aminoacid conjugates, 
phosphate esters
, metal salts and 
sulfonate esters
.
Liposomes can also be used as carriers for the active compounds of the present invention. Liposomes are micelles made of various lipids such as 
cholesterol
, phospholipids, fatty acids, and derivatives thereof. Various modified lipids can also be used. Liposomes can reduce the toxicity of the active compounds, and increase their stability. Methods for preparing liposomal suspensions containing active ingredients therein are generally known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811; Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N. Y. (1976).
The active ingredient can be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt that retains the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable. A compound for use in the invention may possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base, such as salts including sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites,

EXAMPLESExample 1Biochemical AssaysCompounds for use in the methods of the invention can be identified by their ability to inhibit LSD1. The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit LSD1 can be tested as follows. Human recombinant LSD1 protein was purchased from BPS Bioscience Inc. In order to monitor LSD1 enzymatic activity and/or its inhibition rate by our inhibitor(s) of interest, di-methylated H3-K4 peptide (Millipore) was chosen as a substrate. The demethylase activity was estimated, under aerobic conditions, by measuring the release of H2O2 produced during the catalytic process, using the Amplex® Red peroxide/peroxidase-coupled assay kit (Invitrogen).
Briefly, a fixed amount of LSD1 was incubated on ice for 15 minutes, in the absence and/or in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (e.g., from 0 to 75 μM, depending on the inhibitor strength). 
Tranylcypromine
 (Biomol International) was used as a control for inhibition. Within the experiment, each concentration of inhibitor was tested in triplicate. After leaving the enzyme interacting with the inhibitor, 12.5 μM of di-methylated H3-K4 peptide was added to each reaction and the experiment was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The enzymatic reactions were set up in a 50 mM 
sodium phosphate
, pH 7.4 buffer. At the end of the incubation, Amplex® Red reagent and horseradish peroxidase (HPR) solution were added to the reaction according to the recommendations provided by the supplier (Invitrogen), and left to incubate for 30 extra minutes at room temperature in the dark. A 1 μM H2O2 solution was used as a control of the kit efficiency. The conversion of the Amplex® Red reagent to 
resorufin
 due to the presence of H2O2 in the assay, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 540 nm, emission at 590 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure level of H2O2 produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.
The maximum demethylase activity of LSD1 was obtained in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of LSD1. The Ki (IC50) of each inhibitor was estimated at half of the maximum activity.
Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 
3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine
 (
kynuramine dihydrobromide
, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. 
Kynuramine
 is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, 
kynuramine
 is converted into 
4-hydroxyquinoline
 (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.
The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of 
kynuramine
 into 
4-hydroxyquinoline
. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 μL. The assay buffer was 100 mM 
HEPES
, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in triplicate within the same experiment.
Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 μg for MAO-A and 0.5 μg for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (e.g., from 0 to 50 μM, depending on the inhibitor strength). 
Tranylcypromine
 (Biomol International) was used as a control for inhibition.
After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, 60 to 90 μM of 
kynuramine
 was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 μL (v/v) of NaOH 2N. The conversion of 
kynuramine
 to 
4-hydroxyquinoline
, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.
The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 
4-hydroxyquinoline
 formed from 
kynuramine
 deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes. The Ki (IC50) of each inhibitor was determined at Vmax/2.

Example 3LSD1 and LSD1/MAO-B Dual Inhibitors Increase Histone 
Lysine
 Methylation in Cell Based AssaysHistone from SH-SYSY cells grown in the presence of Compound Dual-1 (a dual LSD1/MAOB inhibitor)(Compound 1 in Example 2 above) or 
tranylcypromine
 (
parnate
) for 1, 2, and 3 days were extracted and subjected to western blot analysis using a commercially available antibody specific for dimethylated H3-K4. B-actin was used as a loading control.
The results of a western blot stained for H3K4 methylation with SH-SY5Y cells grown in the presence of Compound Dual-1 or 
tranylcypromine
 (
parnate
) for 1, 2, and 3 days, showing that this compound, Dual-1, increases H3K4 (4 methylation in cells in a time dependent manner and furthermore Compound Dual-1 appears to be 10-fold or more potent at increasing global dimethylated H3K4 levels as compared to 
tranylcypromine
.
Furthermore, the inventors have conducted similar studies for other dual inhibitors of LSD1/MAOB and with selective LSD1 inhibitors and found that these compounds can increase dimethylated H3K4 levels in similarly performed assays.
Example 4LSD1 Inhibitors can be Administered Safely to MammalsMaximum tolerated dose studies and pharmacokinetics for several LSD1 inhibitors were assessed to determine if the compound can be administered to mammals safely at doses that are expected to achieve therapeutic effects. Results in chronic dosing experiments indicate that therapeutic levels can be reached in vivo.
Example 5LSD1 Inhibitors Inhibit Platelet Levels in MammalsMethod for determination of effects of LSD1 inhibitors on platelets:
3 mice were treated for 5 consecutive days with the compounds and doses indicated in table 2 . On the fifth day, 60min after the administration, mice were sacrificed and blood was collected in 
sodium
 citrate-containing tubes for haemogram analysis. Platelet levels were determined and referred as % of platelets compared with the levels found in mice treated with vehicle. Platelet levels were determined in a standard hematology analyzer (Abacus Junior Vet, from Diatron) following the manufacturer's instructions.
20% 
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
 in H2O was used as a vehicle. When necessary, 10% 
DMSO
 was also added in the vehicle. Each day, compounds were administered in a single intraperitoneal injection with administration volumes of 15 ml/kg.
Mice strain was Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu. Animals were maintained in air and temperature controlled cages with regular supply of water and food.
