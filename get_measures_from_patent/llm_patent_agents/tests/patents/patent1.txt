Background of the InventionG-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)Receptors coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein have seven transmembrane domains and are also known as "
G protein-coupled receptors
" (GPCR) (Oldham &amp; HA MM, Nature 9:60-71, 2008).
According to the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) - Receptor Database, in humans, these receptors are divided into classes, including Rhodopsin family 
(R)
 (Fredriksson et al Mol. Pharmacol. 63:1256-1272, 2003.).
According OVERINGTON and collaborators (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 5 (12) :993-996, 2006), drugs used clinically that have as pharmacological target this family of GPCRs correspond to approximately one quarter of the world pharmaceutical market. This is justified because the main role of these receptors is to recognize that a variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands extracellulars as hormones, proteins, lipids, neurotransmitters, among others (BJARNADOTTIR RN et al, Genomics 88:263-273, 2006: OLDHAM &amp; HAMM, Nature 9:60-71, 2008), which involves them in various physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. As an example, the activation of GPCR in the male urogenital system regulates from muscle contraction to cell proliferation and differentiation (AVELLAR et al., An. Acad. Bras. Cienc. 81 (3): 321-344, 2009). The ligands that act on these receptors show a remarkable degree of structural diversity (WESS Pharmacol. Ther. 80 (3) :231-264, 1998).
R family of GPCR's show great similarity in 
amino acid
 sequence in specific regions of these receptors, particularly in the hydrophobic transmembrane region of ligand recognition. This can be checked, for example, in the α1A adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors, which have Asp residue in TM3 region committed to interaction with protonated 
nitrogen
 group of the ligand, and Ser and Tyr residues in the TM5 region important in the recognition of the ligand via 
hydrogen
 bonding. Considering these two receptors, these ligands recognition regions have 45% homology to each other (reviewed in OLDHAM &amp; HAMM, Nature 9:60-71, 2008). Furthermore, there is a structural relationship between the ligands of these receptors that correspond with the 
nitrogen
 molecules still containing a protonatable groups aromatic region (FREDRIKSSON et al. Mol Pharmacol 63: 1256-1272, 2003).
AdrenoceptorsIn humans, the α1A, α1B and α1D adrenoceptors are encoded by distinct genes (HIEBLE et al. Pharmacol Rev 45:267-270, 1995; MICHEL et al, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 352 (1): 1 -10, 995), whose main structural feature consists in a high similarity degree in the 
amino acid
 sequence, showing similarity of about 65-73% in their domains (LANGER, Eur. J. Urol 36:. 2-6, 1999; VARMA &amp; DENG, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 78:267-292, 2000; ZHONG &amp; MINNEMAN, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 375:261-276, 1999; HUH et al., Genes Genet. Syst. 85 (l):65-73, 2010). Three subtypes have broad tissue distribution and may be a predominance of a particular subtype as showed in the mRNA study with rat tissues performed by SCOFIELD et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 275: 1035-1042, 1995). In this study we can observe the predominance of the α1A subtype in the prostate and bladder, α1B in the liver, and α1D in the aorta of the rat.
In the autonomic nervous system, al α1 adrenoceptors are responsible for the modulation of non-vascular smooth muscle contraction and also vascular and therefore have major importance in the control of vascular tone and hence the control of blood pressure (HIEBLE, Pharm. Acta. Helv. 74 (2-3): 163-171, 2000; MICHELOTTI et al., Pharmacol. Ther. 88:281-309, 2000).
It is important to point out their actions the male urogenital system. Several studies have characterized the presence of these receptors in the lower urinary tract, especially in human prostatic tissue and bladder detrusor muscle (FORRAY et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 45 (4):703-708, 1994; HATANO et al, Br. J. Pharmacol. 113 (3): 723-728, 1994; MARSHALL et al, J. Pharmacol. 115 (5): 781-786, 1995; HIEBLE &amp; RUFFOLO, Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 6(4): 367-387, 1997; MALLOY et al, J. Urol. Sep; 160 (3 Pt 1) :937-943, 1998; MURAMATSU et al. Br J. Urol. 74 (5):572-578, 1994; HIEBLE et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 45:267-270, 1995; MICHELOTTI et al, Pharmacol. Ther. 88:281-309, 2000). In this system the α1 adrenoceptors are involved in the contraction of the bladder base, mainly via α1A adrenoceptor and α1D adrenoceptor, respectively (Chen et al., J. Urol. 174:370-374, 2005).
α1 adrenoceptor antagonists have been widely used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), clinical condition that affects an increasing proportion of male population, causing obstruction of urinary flow due to an increase in the prostate size (MCNEAL, Urol. Clin. North Am., 17, 477-486, 1990). The prevalence of BPH increases with age, therefore, it jumps from about 50 % of men with 60 years age, reaching 80% of men with 80 age (COCKETT et al. Prog. Urol. 1 (6 ): 957-72, 1991).
It was found that the α1A subtype adrenoceptor is predominant in the human prostate at a level of RNAm (Price et al, Mol Pharmacol 46:221-226, 1994; TSENG-CRANK et al, J. Pharmacol. 115: 1475-1485, 1995) and of protein (LEPOR et al, J. Urol 149:640-642, 1993; MICHEL et al, J. Auton Pharmacol 16:21-28, 1996). Recent studies show that α1D subtype is also present in the prostate, at a significant extent (KOJIMA et al., Prostate 66:761-767, 2006). Thus, the use of drugs with higher affinity profile for α1A adrenoceptors and α1D adrenoceptors can be effective in the treatment of BPH and more tolerable than nonselective α1 adrenoceptor antagonist (CHAPPLE, Br J Urol 76 (1) :47-56, 1995), since it avoids adverse effects.
α1 Adrenoceptor bindingsMany chemical classes have the capacity to be recognized by α1 adrenoceptors. Among the drugs with high affinity for the three α1A, α1B and α1D receptor subtypes, it is found the 
prazosin
 antagonist (SHIBATA et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 48:250-258, 1995), 
quinazoline
 derivative used in the treatment of hypertension.
Another important chemical class includes 
phenylpiperazine
 derivatives such as BMY 7378, α1D adrenoceptor antagonist with affinity in the nanomolar range and used as a pharmacological tool (GOETZ et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 272 (2-3): R5-6, 1995). Furthermore, BMY 7378 is a partial agonist of 
serotonin 5-HT1A
 receptor (CHAPUT &amp; MONTIGNI J. Pharmacol. Ther. 246 (1): 359-370, 1988).
Serotonergic Receptors (5-HT)In mammals, it is known seven families of 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-7), for a total of 14 structurally and pharmacologically distinct subtypes of 5-HT receptors ((HOYER et al, Pharmacol Rev 46:157-203, 1994; HOYER &amp; MARTIN, Neuropharmacology 36:419-428, 1997; SAXENA et al, Trends Pharmacol Sci 19:311-316, 1998; VILLALON et al, Drug Discov Today 2:294-300, 1997; VILLALON &amp; CENTURION, Naunyn. Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 376 (1-2) :45-63 2007). Considering the primary structure, the 5-HT metabotropic receptors have a high degree of similarity to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors (FREDRIKSSON et al. Mol Pharmacol.:1256-1272 63, 2003).
Metabotropic subtypes 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A show greater similarity with α1 adrenoceptor receptors, in about 45% (TRUMPP-KALLMEYER et al. J. Med. 35(19):3448-3462. 1992) and moderate homology (35%) between them (BARNES &amp; SHARP Neuropharmacology 38:1083-1152, 1999).
5-HT1A ReceptorsThe 5-HT1A receptor was one of the first receptors of this family which have the gene cloned (KOBILKA et al Nature 329:75-79, 1987; Fargin et al Nature 335 (6188):358-360, 1988). RNAm studies of the receptor 5-HT1A show the expression in the brain, which are present in high density in the cerebral cortex. However, they are also found outside the CNS, such as the spleen, kidney (neonatal), intestine (PUCADYIL &amp; CHATTOPADHYAY, Progr. Lipid Res. 45:295-333, 2006) and prostate (ABDUL et al. Anticancer Res 14 (3A): 1215-1220, 1994; DIZEYI et al Prostate 59 (3) :328-336, 2004).
It is known that prostate neuroendocrine cells synthesize, store and release growth factors and neuropeptides including 5-HT (ABRAHAMSSON et al. 1986), having specific receptors for 5-HT in these tissues (HOOSEIN et al. 1993). Thus, the potential use of 5-HT1A antagonists has been highlighted for the treatment of BPH since they have an anti-proliferative effect in tumor prostate cells and are useful in controlling the growth of androgen independent tumors (ABDUL and cols. Anticancer Res 14 (3A):1215-1220, 1994; DIZEYI et al Prostate 59 (3) :328-336, 2004). The chemical structures shown below are examples of some of the chemical classes which have affinity for 5-HT1A (structures
taken from IUPHAR Receptor Database):Hypothetical model of molecular recognitionThe determination of the crystal structure of GPCRs in general is hampered by difficult to reproduce in models of crystallization of natural conformation of these receptors that have seven transmembrane domains. For example, only recently, the first crystallography of a GPCR has been obtained, in case the human β2-adrenoceptor and subsequently A2a 
adenosine
 receptor (reviewed in TATE and SCHERTLER, Curr Opin Struct Biol 19 (4): 386 - 395 2009;. KOBILKA and SCHERTLER, Trends Pharmacol Sci 29 (2) :79-83, 2008). Therefore, the construction of predictive models and the study of interactions with known ligands are important for obtaining new knowledge about these important pharmacological targets (THIEL, Nat Biotechnol 22:513-519, 2004).
Mutagenesis studies has indicated that the protonated 
nitrogen
 of the α adrenoceptors ligands, such as 
phenylpiperazine
 derivatives, carry our ionic interactions with a 
aspartate
 residue in the TM3, the 
amino
 group in the form of positive ion, which is considered as main pharmacophore group (PEREZ, Biochem Pharmacol 73 (8): 1051 -1062, 2007). On the other hand, the aromatic rings carry out hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with complementary residues in TM2, 4, 6 and 7 (WAUGH et al J. Biol Chem 276 (27): 25366-2537, 2001). In addition to these important attachments, the presence of an aromatic ring containing acceptors groups of 
hydrogen
 bond in the positions meta and para are relevant in the stabilization of the linker-receptor complex to interact with Ser residues in TM5 (LOPEZ-RODRIGUEZ et al. J. Med. Chem 40, 2653-2656, 1997; PEREZ Biochem Pharmacol 73 (8): 1051-1062, 2007).
The α1 adrenoceptor and the 5-HT1A receptors show a great similarity in ligand recognition transmembrane region (TRUMPP-KALLMEYER et al. J. Med. 35 (19) : 3448-3462, 1992). There has been evidence that an important site for binding of α1A-adrenoceptor antagonists and 5-HT1A receptors is a Asp residue in the TM3, which interacts with the protonated 
amino
 group of the ligands (LI et al. J. Mol. Model 14 (10) :957-966,2008; LOPEZ-RODRIGUEZ et al Mol Pharmacol 62 (1): 15-21, 2002). Several strategies are available for the molecular design of drugs. Among these the most important is the physiological approach, which is based on the mechanism of pharmacological action desired (KUBINYI. Pharmazie 50; 647-662 1995), which depends on selection of the therapeutic target, which in turn depends on knowledge of the involved pathophysiological process. Chronic diseases may involve alteration in the cellular signing of more than one type of receptor, and therefore drugs that are targeted to act on different receptors may be therapeutically useful (HUBER et al Biochemistry 47 (42): 11013-1 1023, 2008).
Several studies have shown the presence of α1 adrenoceptors within the urinary tract, particularly in human prostate tissue and bladder detrusor, which have their increased expression in BPH (FORRAY et al. Pharmacol. 45 (4) :703-708, 1994 ; HATANO et al J. Pharmacol 113 (3) :723-728, 1994; Marshall et al Br J Pharmacol 115 (5): 1-786 78, 1995; HIEBLE &amp; RUFFOLO Expert Opin Investig Drugs 6 (4) :367-387, 1997;. MALLOY et al Urol, J. et al Sep. 160 (3 Pt 1) :937-943,1998; MURAMATSU et al Br J Urol. 74 (5) :572-578, 1994; HIEBLE et al Pharmacol Rev. 45:267-270, 1995; HIEBLE Pharma Helv Acta 74 (2-3): 163-171, 2000; MTCHELOTTI et al. Pharmacol. Ther. 88:281-309, 2000). In addition to these receptors, 5-HT1A receptors are also expressed in human prostate tissue where they exert a proliferative effect (ABDUL et al, Anticancer Res 14 (3A): 1215-1220, 1994; DIZEYL et al Prostate 59 (3) :328-336, 2004). In view of this, there is great interest in the field of development of new drugs for dual antagonists for the treatment of BPH since it has an interest in the block of α1A/D and 5-HT1A adrenoceptors receptors.

Detailed Description of the InventionThe present invention provides 
N-phenylpiperazine
 derivatives, ligands, pharmaceutical compositions containing them.
N-phenylpiperazine
 derivatives of the invention are particularly useful as binders for in vitro processes and are also particularly useful in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and / or lower urinary tract symptoms, in addition to anti-proliferative effect, including the cell proliferation of androgen-independent tumor prostatic origin. In particular, a 
2-alcoxyphenylpiperazine
 derivative of the invention have high affinity for α1A and α1D adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors and comprises:
A basic nitrogen atom for ionic interaction with the carboxylate group of the 
aspartate
 residue (Asp) in TM3 of these receptors; andAt least one aromatic ring for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with complementary residues in TM2 4, 6 and 7; andA group with a negative charge density at position 2 (orto) of the 
nitrogen
 or the 
N-phenylpiperazine
 subunit, 
hydrogen
 bond acceptor e.g. alkoxides and isosteres.
Several compounds were synthesized with 
N-phenylpiperazine
 pharmacophore grouping. The chemical structures of the compounds of the list LDT 2-6, LDT8, LDT 62-69, LDT 39, 70 and LDT 245 are listed below:
















There are two studies with 
N-phenylpiperazine
 derivatives for α1 adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors, one of Ratouis et al (J. Med. 8:271-273, 1965), and the other of Leopold et al (J Pharm. Pharmacol. 56 (2) :247-255, 2003) who studied, among others, the 
phenylpiperazines
 sometimes called LDT5 in the first, and LDT3, LDT4 LDT5 in the second study. In addition, there are also two other references characterizing LDT62-68 as binders for 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 (MOKROSZ et al, Arch Pharm 328: 143-148, 1995), and also a reference for LDT66 and LDT68 as just α1 adrenoceptor ligands (MOKROSZ et al, J Med Chem 39: 1125-1129, 1996). However, none of these references presents determination of the intrinsic activity, and systematic analysis, in parallel, of the reasons for selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor and α1 and α2 adrenoceptors. All LDT2-6-LDT8 and LDT62-68 is presented as a series of potential candidates in the context of the search for antagonists with dual affinity for al-adrenoceptors receptors α1 A / D and 5-HT1A.
Obtaining the novel 
N-phenylpiperazine
All derivatives called in the present invention as LDT's were synthesized from the corresponding 
alkyl halide
, commercial or previously synthesized from the corresponding primary alcohols, using SN2 reaction with 
N-phenylpiperazines
 in 
acetonitrile
 in the presence of amine base or 
carbonate
 at reflux in a conventional or microwave heating, in yields ranging from 86 to 97%, and made available in the form of 
monohydrochloride
 with subsequent solubilization at a concentration of 10 mM in ultrapure water and storage at -20 ° C.
Infra-red spectra were registered by Fourier transform (FT-IR) on a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Spectrum BX) spectrum IH-NMR (300 and 500 MHz CDC13) and 13 C-NMR (75 and 125 MHz CDC13) those were recorded in more Varian Plus (7.05 T) and Bruker Avance DRX300 and DRX500 spectrometer, and mass spectra were recorded on spectrometer Shimadzu LCMS IT-TOF. The plates of the thin layer chromatography (TLC) eluted with a mixture of polar and nonpolar solvents (
ethanol
 / 
chloroform
) showed a single spot indicating the presence of only one compound in each sample, as confirmed by spectrometric analysis. Every day of the experiment, small aliquots of the storage solution in concentrations necessary to perform the experiment in question were diluted.
All experiments using LDT2-6, LDT8 and LDT62-68 and LTD-45 series were performed under light pressure 
sodium
 lamp in order to avoid possible degradation of the compounds.

Functional AssaysIsometric contraction assays were performed using Male Wistar rats, aged 2.5 - 3 months euthanized as described above. The thoracic aorta (tissue enriched in functional α1D adrenergic receptors) was removed, free from adjacent connective and adipose tissues cut in 3 mm segments. Then, each ring was fixed to a tension transducer (Grass FT-03) and immersed in vats containing 9 mL of saline (NaCl 122 mM, KCl 5 mM, CaCl2 1.25 mM, MgCl2 1.25 mM, KH2PO 1,25 mM, NaHCO3 15 mM, 
glucose
 11.5 mM) maintained at 37 ° C under constant aeration with carbonic mixture (95% 02 and 5% CO2). The aort segments were then subjected to a preload of 20 mN per 60 minutes. After recovery of tissues maintained for 1 hour at rest, it was performed a contraction induced by 
phenylephrine
 (PE) 1 µM (α1 adrenergic receptors selective agonist). In this plateau contraction, in order to promote endothelium-dependent relaxation resulting from the activation of the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and subsequent release of 
nitric oxide
 (NO), 
acetylcholine
 1 µM was added. Rings that relaxed at least 80% were considered to have intact endothelium, were used.
Then the preparation was washed and allowed to stand for 1 hour in order to recover the tissue. Then it was performed cumulative curves to 
phenylephrine
 (10-9 to 10-5 M) in the presence of 
propranolol
 1 µM (β-adrenoceptor blocker receptors) before and after incubation for 1 hour of the LDT's at 10 or 50 nM. In parallel, a temporal control was performed to rule out any artifacts on the measured contraction, where was added only the vehicle (ultrapure water 
Milli
 Q ®) instead of the substance to be tested. Strictly following the same protocol as the other tanks wherein it was added the LDT's.
The data were scanned in MacLab 8S system connected to the isometric tension transducer Grass FT-03, which recorded the voltage variation in milinewtons (mN) generated throughout the analysis. The digitized data were then analyzed by Chart 3.4 / s software program (MacLab, Inc., USA). In the pharmacological screening process, the initial concentration of the used LDT's was 50 nM, which is considered as cut concentration, i.e., substances that have no effect at this concentration would not investigated in this test. In contrast, the substances that were in effect, were then tested at lower concentrations (10 or 2 nM) (Table 2). Thus, by constructing concentration-response curves to the agonist PE in the absence and presence of the antagonist, it can be determined the maximum effect parameters (Emax) and the concentration which promotes Emax of 50% (EC50). The ratio of the EC50 value in these two conditions (with and without LDT) matches the third parameter, called "concentration ratio" (or RC). Once it has determined these parameters it is possible to calculate the apparent affinity of the competitive antagonist (KB) in vitro using the Schild equation (Eq. 1) (KENAKIN, Raven Press, New York. Pp :278-322, 1993). log⁢CR-1=logB-log KB


Where CR = concentration ratio (EC'50 / EC50); [B] = 'B' antagonist concentration; KB = equilibrium dissociation constant of the antagonist 'B'.
Data analysis and statistical treatmentThe tension data were analyzed by non-linear regression to calculate the maximum effect parameters (Emax) and concentration which promotes Emax 50% (EC50) using GraphPad Prism software, version 4 (U.S.). To determine whether there was significant difference between the measurements taken before and after treatment with LDT's it was conducted single-factor ANOVA test followed by Newman-Keuls test, considering a 5% alpha risk (differences were considered significant if P &lt;0.05).
Functional Tests with prostateIsometric contraction assays were performed using Male Wistar rats, aged 2,5 - 3 months euthanized as described above. The male rat ventral prostate was removed and dissected into 10 mm segments. Then, each segment was fixed to a tension transducer (GRASS FT-03) and immersed in vats containing 9 ml of saline solution maintained at 37 ° C under constant aeration with 
carbon mixture ( 95
% 02 and 5% CO2). The segments were then subjected to a preload of 10 mN per 60 minutes. 1 µM Phenylephrine-induced contraction (PE) (α1 adrenergic selective agonist) was performed. Then the preparation was washed and allowed to stand for 1 hour in order to recover the tissue. It was carried out cumulative curves to 
phenylephrine
 (10-8 - 10-3 M) in the presence of 1 µM 
propranolol
 (β-adrenoceptor blocker receptors) before and after incubation for 1 hour of the LDT's 3, 10 or 100 50 nM. In parallel, a time control was performed.
Data were digitized at MacLab 8S system connected to the isometric tension transducer Grass FT-03, which recorded the voltage variation in milinewtons (mN) generated throughout the analysis. The digitized data were then analyzed using Chart 3.4 / s software program (MacLab, Inc., USA). Thus, by constructing concentration-response curves to the agonist 
phenylephrine
 in the absence and presence of the antagonist it can be determined the parameters maximum effect (Emax) and the concentration that promotes Emax of 50% (EC50). The ratio of the EC50 value in these two conditions (with and without LDT) is the third parameter called "concentration ratio" (or CR). After this parameters were determined, it was possible to calculate the apparent affinity of the competitive antagonist (KB) in vitro using the Schild equation (KENAKIN, Raven Press, New York. Pp :278-322, 1993).
Statistical AnalysisTo determine whether there was significant difference between the measured values it was performed an ANOVA single factor test followed by Newman-Keuls test, considering an alpha risk of 5% (differences were considered significant if P &lt;0.05).
Binding assays (Binding)α1A adrenoceptorsMembrane PreparationFollowing the protocol described previously in the literature, membrane preparations from rabbit liver homogenates were obtained. Such membrane preparations are enriched in adrenoceptor subtype α1A. The tissue obtained as described above (∼ 30 g) was naturally thawed, immersed in thawing solution (0.25 M 
sucrose
, 1 mM 
EGTA
 and 5 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4)) freezing. Then, the tissue was transferred to a petri dish on ice containing solution for homogenizing liver (2 mM 
EDTA
, 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4)) freezing. The liver was then carefully cut by ignoring the most fibrous part.
Then, the material was transferred into a beaker where with the aid of Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (speed 24,000 RPM), the tissue was homogenized with the same buffer solution at a ratio of 6 parts of the solution to 1 part material. The material was homogenized three times for 20 seconds; in the intervals the solution was allowed to stand for 1 minute on ice. Subsequently, the homogenate was subjected to centrifugation 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 ° C, yielding a supernatant which was subjected to ultracentrifugation 80,000 x g for 40 minutes at 4 ° C yielding a pellet. This pellet was resuspended in buffer solution without NaCl (1 mM 
EDTA
 and 50 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4)) and further subjected to ultracentrifugation in the same previous conditions. The pellet obtained was resuspended in this step storage solution (0.25 M 
sucrose
, 1 mM 
EGTA
 and 5 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4)) with the aid of a manual type Dounce homogenizer and stored in aliquots at 300 µL liquid 
nitrogen
. In all protocols for membrane preparations the dosage of protein were performed according to the method of LOWRY et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 193 (1) :265-275, 1951).
Binding of [3H]-prazosina to α1A adrenoceptorsThe standardization of the assay was done as described in the literature. In the saturation test it was measured the binding of [3H]-prazosin to native α1A -adrenoceptor the absence and presence of different concentrations of nonradioactive 
prazosin
 (10-10 - 10-7 M). For competition assays, test tubes containing 350 µL of intermediate solution ([3H]-prazosin 0.16 nM, 1.6 mM 
EDTA
, 50 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4 at 25°C)) it was added the 50 µL of different concentrations of LDT's (end concentration 10-9 - 10-4 M) or 50 µL of water (solvent for dilution of LDT's) for the determination of total binding or 50 µL nonradioactive 
prazosin
 at 10 µM (end 1 µM) to the determination of nonspecific binding, and 200 µg of membrane preparations of rabbit liver (α1A) contained in 50 µL suspension completing end volume of 500 µL. Assays were performed in triplicate.
In both assays, membrane preparations were incubated at 0° C for 45 minutes. After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by rapid vacuum filtration on glass fiber filter (GMF 3 Filtrak ®). The filters were washed four times with 4 ml of the same solution under vacuum to remove all free radioligand. Then the filters were dried and placed in vials containing 5 ml scintillation fluid (4% PPO, 0.1% 
POPOP
 w / v in 
toluene
). The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR).
Specific binding of [3H]-prazosin to α1A adrenoceptors was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. Data obtained by saturation experiment allowed us to obtain the parameters Kd (dissociation constant), which is the concentration of radioligand required to occupy 50% of the receptor sites and Bmax, maximum density of binding sites, which were calculated by non-linear regression. The increased values of bound were calculated indirectly by the value obtained for the concentration of bound radioligand (fmol / mg protein) which was multiplied by the dilution factor (DF) of radioligand (e.g. [3H]-prazosin) results from adding the nonradioactive ligand (e.g., 
prazosin
), in a process known as isotope dilution. This procedure aims to obtain a saturation curve with less expenditure of radioactive substances and biological materials. Since competition assays allow us to construct inhibition curves of specific binding of radioligand. The higher the concentration of competitor agent employed in this case the LDT 's study, the greater the competition for specific receptors, decreasing the formation radioligand-receptor complex. This can be seen by the gradual decrease of radioactivity retained on the filters is detected by the counter liquid scintillation.
From these curves it was possible to calculate the LDT's concentration values which inhibits 50% radioligand binding (IC50).These values were converted to Ki values (competitive dissociation constant at equilibrium or inhibition constant) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Eq. 2). Ki=CI501+L/Kd


Where Ki = inhibition constant; 
CI50
 = concentration inhibiting 50% radioligand binding; [L] = concentration of radioligand; Kd = equilibrium dissociation constant of the ligand (measured in saturation assay).

The homogenate obtained was filtered through four layers of gauze and then subjected to centrifugation 5,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4 ° C, yielding a supernatant which was subsequently ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 minutes at 4 ° C, obtaining a pellet. This pellet was resuspended in buffer free of NaCl and subjected to a further ultrafiltration under the same conditions. The pellet obtained in this step was resuspended in storage solution (0.25M 
sucrose
, 1mM 
EGTA
 TIIM and 5 mM 
Tris
 (pH 7.4)) with the aid of a manual type Dounce homogenizer and stored in aliquots of 300 µL in liquid 
nitrogen
.

The values of Kd and Bmax were 0.7 ± 0.1 nM and 125 ± 42 fmol / mg protein, respectively (Neves et al., Bioorg Med. Chem. 18 (5): 1925-1935, 2010). It was incubate for 15 minutes at 37 ° C, 50 mg of membrane preparation of rat hippocampus, 50 µL contained in suspension in 50 mM Tris-HCl, into tubes containing 400 µl intermediate solution ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT 1.25 mM, 1.25 mM CaC12, 1.25 mM MnC12, 10 µM

Specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors was defined as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding. For these receptors were also determined the LC50 and Ki parameters.
Intrinsic activity at native 5-HT1A receptorsThe GTP presence displaces the GPCR to a state of low affinity (Lahti et al, 1992). The intrinsic activity of a substance can be estimated using GPCR agonist or antagonist radioligand appropriate to define the affinity of the substance in the state of high and low affinity receptor, respectively. Therefore, to determine the intrinsic activity of the more potent derivatives in 5HT1A receptors it was calculated their dissociation constants (Ki) using an antagonist as radioligand ([3H] p-MPPF) in the presence of a high concentration of GTP (Ki low) or an agonist ([3H] 8-OH-DPAT) in the absence of GTP (Ki high). Values for Ki ratio (Low Ki / High Ki) considerably greater than 1 (one) indicates agonism, whereas values close to 1 indicate antagonism while negative values indicate inverse agonism.

D2-Like ReceptorsMembrane PreparationThe membrane preparation of rat striatum (receptor D2 - "like" - subtypes of 
dopamine
 receptors: D2 , D3 and D4) was performed according to literature description (Niznik et al, Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.. Pharmacol 329:333-343, 1985; Terai et al. Eur J Pharmacol 173:177, 1989; HAMDI et al, Life Sci 50, 1529-1534, 1992). Briefly, organs were homogenized for 30 seconds three times in Fisatom in 50 mM Tris-HCl, MgCl2 8 mM, 5 mM 
EDTA
 (pH 7.4 at 4 ° C) and then centrifuged at 48,000 x gav (20 minutes 4 ° C). The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 
EDTA
 (pH 7.4 at 37 ° C), incubated at 37 ° C for 10 minutes and centrifuged twice more. The final pellet was resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 1.5 mL / g tissue.
D2-Like receptors binding assayD2-Like receptors binding assays were performed as described by our group (Neves et al., Bioorg. Med. 18 (5), 1925-1935, 2010). 50 µg rat striatal membranes were incubated for 60 min at 37 ° C in medium containing 0.1 nM of the antagonist radioligand [3H]-YM 09151-2, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mM MgC12, 1.5 mM CaC12, 1 mM 
EDTA
 and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 at 25 ° C) in the presence or absence of LTD's (0,003-30 µM). Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 30 µM 
sulpiride
. Assays were performed in triplicate.
The radioactivity retained on the filters was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). For these receptors were also determined IC50 and Ki parameters.
Protein dosageThe dosage of the protein content of the samples was performed by the literature and proposed modified for microtiter plate (96 well plate) colorimetric method. To construct a standard curve used the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 250, 350 µg / mL. It was added 50 µL patterns of protein or 50 µL of dilute protein samples under study to each well containing 250 µL of a 2% 
disodium carbonate
 in 0.1 N NaOH, 1% 
cupric sulphate
 and 2 % 
sodium potassium tartrate
, 50 µL water (white). Finally, it was added 15 µL the Folin to each well and mixing with multichannel pipette. The plate was incubated for 45 min at room temperature from the homogenization of the first well. The absorbance values were obtained in plate spectrophotometer at a wavelength equal to 700 nm. The experiments were performed in triplicate using two different dilution factors. The calculation of the protein content of the samples was performed by interpolation using the values of the standard curve of absorbance versus protein concentration, which were analyzed by linear regression using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 program. Values are expressed in mg protein / ml homogenate.
Data analysis and statistical treatmentThe data obtained in binding assays were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (USA) in order to calculate the parameters of the competition curves, IC50, and the saturation curve, such as Kd and Bmax. Specially for the saturation experiments in the α1A and α1B adrenergic receptors one or two binding sites were tested, by choosing the one that best applies through the F test (DE LEAN et al., Mol Pharmacol. 21 (1) :5 it, 1982). Thus, when the sum of squares of errors was greatly reduced by assuming the model of the two opposite sites of a site model, the first model was used to obtain estimates of Kd values of 
prazosin
. On the other hand, when no improvement was significant when adding a second site, it was obtained a single Kd value.
The difference between experimental groups was analyzed by single factor analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) followed by post hoc test of Newman-Keuls (more than 2 groups) considering in both cases P &lt;0.05.
Cell proliferation in vitro testHuman prostate cancer cells (DU-145) were cultured in medium (RPMI 1640) until confluence. Then the cells were dissociated, plated (5 x 103 cells / well) and maintained in medium free of fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. Then the cells were maintained and treated with 5-HT (1 µM) or 
phenylephrine
 (3 µM) in the absence or presence of LTD's (5, 50 or 500 nM) for 48 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by using the MTT technique (MOSMANN, T. Immunol Methods. 16;65 (1 -2) :55-63, 1983).
Acute toxicity testSwiss mice (female, 25-30 g, 6 animals per condition) were treated with LDT via intraperitoneal with LTD's at a dose of 100 µg / kg and observed for 14 days in the behavioral framework according to described method (LORKE, D., Arch Toxicol, 54 (4):. 275 - 87, 1983, modified). The temperature was measured by retal probe before and after 30 and 60 min of described treatment.
Phenylephrine-induced contraction inhibition in rat aortaAccording SCOFIELD et al (J. Pharmacol Exp Ther 275:. 1035-1042, 1995) as well as TESTA et al (Life Sci 57 (13). P1159-63, 1995), the rat thoracic aorta corresponds to a tissue expressing mainly α1D-adrenoceptors in addition are enriched in serotoninergic receptors subtype 5-HT2A (Banes et al, J. Pharmacol Exp Ther 291:.. 1179-1187, 1999). With this in view, the functional tests of contraction in isolated organ model were performed using these tissues. When added to the incubation bath, none of the LDT's (50 mM) changed the baseline of isometric tension. Thus, was discarded a possible ruled-agonist effect on receptors with vasoconstrictor action, such as α1-adrenoceptors and 
serotonin
 (5-HT2A), on this concentration. Similarly, targeting to rule out any artifacts on the measured contraction, a time control was performed where only the vehicle was added (ultrapure Mili Q® water) in place of the substance to be tested, strictly following the same protocol as the other vats were added to the LDT ' s (Fig. 1).
We conducted experiments with BMY7378 50 nM, α1D adrenoceptor antagonist used as positive control, and obtained a value of KB = 2.95 nM, consistent with the literature (CARROLL et al, Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 11:1119 - 1121, 2001). Within the series of LDT's 2-6 and 8, all substances, except LDT6, reduced the contraction induced by FE, also inducing a shift of concentration-response curves to FE to the right, quantified by the ratio of CE50 (CR). Thus, the data suggest an α1D adrenergic antagonist effect for all derivatives studied, except LDT6.Thereafter the apparent affinity of antagonists was calculated (Table 1). The second experimental condition (LDT's 10 nM) was conducted only for the LDT 5 and 8 or 2 nM (LDT 245), to determine the affinity (KB) calculated from the Schild equation. The entire series LDT 2-8 except LDT6, showed great affinity for α1D adrenoceptors. Compared with BMY7378 (KB=2.95 nM) affinity for this receptor is greater for the LDT derivative 5 and 8 (KB = 0.57 and 0.16, respectively, * P &lt;0.05).
Regarding other derivatives LDT's 62-70 and 39, all concentration-response curves to 
phenylephrine
 suffered a classic right shift, quantified by the ratio of EC50 (CR) (Table 4), in the presence of LDT's relative the control curve, thus behaving as competitive antagonists. Among the antagonists N-phenyl 
piperazine
 varying the alkyl chain attached to position R1 (LDT ' s 63-68), and comparing them with the LDT62 derivative, there was a significant increase in relative affinity (KB) by α1D-adrenergic receptors for LDT66 and LDT67 derivatives(Table 2), in which the alkyl chain ranging from six to seven carbons, respectively, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important for molecular recognition in this subtype of adrenergic receptor, which is consistent with the literature which describes the important role of hydrophobic forces in determining the affinity of 
N-phenylpiperazines
 or orto- 
methoxyphenyl piperazines
 for the α adrenoceptors.
The increase in hydrophobicity on LDT69, given by the substitution of R2 by an ethoxylated group did not alter the affinity to α1D-adrenergic receptor relative to LDT62, wherein R2 is a methoxyl. Moreover, the inclusion of hydrophilic group donor and acceptor of 
hydrogen
 bond, or the substituent in R2 absence observed for LDT70 and LDT39, respectively, reduce affinity by α1D - adrenergic receptors. The range of affinity of LDT's 66-68 for α1D adrenoceptor is is equivalent to the affinity reported for other antagonists such as 
N-phenylpiperazine BMY7378
 and

Binding assays (Binding)Adrenoceptor α1A and α1B - Percentage of binding of [3H]-prazosin
First, saturation assays preparation of rabbit liver and rat were performed to determine the binding parameters of [3H]-prazosin. To adrenoceptor α1A after analysis considering the binding of the radioligand to one or two specific binding sites, the best curve fit was obtained considering the two-site model. In this case it has a high affinity site corresponding to the α1L type, and a second low affinity site, the α1L, whose existence, nature and function are discussed in the literature. While for α1B adrenoceptor at the best fit occurred in only one binding site model. By using 
prazosin
 non-radioactive as competitor agent to standardized curve competition for binding of 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin. Accordingly, the competition curve was biphasic in preparation of rabbit liver, approximately 2/3 of the sites labeled by 0.1 nM [3H]-prazosin showing high affinity for 
prazosin
 (
CI50
 = 0.16 nM) and 1 / 3 had low affinity sites (
CI50
 1 nM).
Kd values of [3H]-prazosin to α1A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and α1B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol. Pharmacol., 48:250-258, 1995). Concerning the LDTs, all series tested was able to inhibit specific bounding of the [3 H]-prazosin in competition assays.
For the calculation of the Ki of the LTD's it was used the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where for 
prazosin
 (PZS) Kd values were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites of high and low affinity, respectively to α1A adrenoceptor, and it was used Kd = 0.34 nM for α1B-adrenoceptor. The obtained Ki values are summarized in the following Tables 3 to 5 below.

All LDT 2-8 group showed besides the ability to identify two binding sites, Ki values in the nanomolar range to the high affinity component (α1A) similar to that observed for 
prazosin
 (Table 3). There was an increase in the affinity of the derivatives LDT65 to LDT69 compared to the LDT62 to the α1A adrenoceptors. LDT66, LDT68 and LDT69 derivatives (Ki equal to 43, 38 and 33 nM, respectively) showed affinity six to eight times higher (P &lt;0.01) than LDT62 (Ki = 261 nM) (Table 5). Although LDT65 and LDT67 have Ki values from three to four times smaller (67 and 81 nM, respectively) compared to LDT62 this increase in affinity was not significant (P = 0.06 (LDT65) and 0.1 (LDT67)). There was no difference between affinity and LDT62 and LDT63 derivatives. LDT64, LDT39 and LDT70. For adrenoceptor α1B, once again there was a lower affinity profile for LDT6 in the range µM when compared to the others, especially the LDT8, nanomolar range, but the difference was not significant. Thus, we see that the auxophoric substitution observed in LDT6 does not contribute to the upregulation of the apparent affinity for α1 B / D adrenoceptor subtypes.
The LDT's 62-70 and LDT39 derivatives have lower affinity for α1B-adrenoceptors in relation to the α1A and α1D receptors. Although none of the structural changes has significantly altered the affinity, there seems to be an increased affinity related to the increase of the alkyl chain from LDT65 derivative. Moreover, there also seems to have greater interaction when the ethoxylated group in the R2 
phenylpiperazine
 subunit position present in LDT69 (also observed for LDT8) compared with the LDT62 methoxyl, using the same standard affinity receptors α1A, but to a lesser degree. Mokrosz et al. (1997) found that only LDT's 66 and 68 are ligands of α1-adrenergic receptor, however, it was not determined their affinity. Thus, we evaluate by what α1 -adrenoceptor subtypes the LDT's would bind specifically and what would be its intrinsic activity in these subtypes. As for α1D adrenoceptors it seems that hydrophobic interactions with alkyl chain good size are important requirements for molecular recognition of a receptor α1A because the affinities (Table 6) were significantly higher for LDT66 and LDT68 derivatives, which have alkyl chain with 6 and 8 carbons, respectively.
The LTD's with size increase of the alkyl chain, more specifically LDT's 65-68 derivatives, LDT 66 and 68 are the most potent, are within the affinity range shown for most drugs in clinical use, which makes them new potential dual α1 adrenoceptor antagonists (α1A and α1d) which may be useful not only in relieving the symptoms of BPH but also to inhibit the proliferation of the prostatic tissue via α1A adrenoceptor antagonism.
A2A receptors - binding percentage of [3H] RX821002Previously performed by our group, saturation assays in rat cortex, where it was determined the binding parameters of [3H] RX821002 (Kd = 2.05 ± 0.28 nM and Bmax = 124 ± 7 fmol protein / mg) to α2A receptors. This Kd value was used to calculate Ki of LDT's using Cheng-Prusoff equation.
During competition assays, the LDT's 65-68 were able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H] RX821002 to α2A adrenergic receptors, but with lower affinities (µM range, Table 5), as well as the α-1B adrenergic with respect to α1A / 1D adrenergic receptors. The fact that these substances present a low affinity for this receptor is important for there is a high homology between α2A adrenoceptor subtypes. Thus, the tested LDT's are likely to present little blocking of this α2A adrenoceptor that is involved with the regulation of central nervous, cardiovascular and male genitourinary systems, by inhibiting the release of 
catecholamines
 in these systems.

The 5-HT1A receptors - binding percentage of [3H]-8-OH-DPATSaturation studies in rat hippocampal enriched tissue in 5-HT1A receptors were performed to determine the binding parameters of the [3H]-8-OH-DPAT (Kd = 0.7 nM ± 0.1 nM and Bmax = 125 ± 42 fmol / mg protein, n = 3), which is consistent with the literature (Neves et al, Bioorg Med Chem 18 (5): 1925-1935, 2010). This Kd value was used to calculate the Ki of the LDT's using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. The Ki obtained values were summarized in the following tables 7 and 8. In Competition assays all tested range was able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. In this receptor, the most prominent derivative was LDT8, which exhibited a very high affinity (Ki = 23.7 pM) compared to it, all other components of the range have significantly lower affinity although all with a high affinity in the nanomolar range.
Compared to LDT62 (Ki = 147 nM), the LTD's 65-68 have 8-29 times higher affinities (Ki (nM) 18, 5, 18 and 9, respectively, P &lt;0.05). On the other hand, LDT63, LDT64, LDT69, LDT70 and LDT39 have similar affinities, with no statistically significant difference (P&gt; 0.05) between values of Ki and that of the LDT62 (Table 8).

In another competition assay for 5-HT1A receptors, the LDT's 65-68 were capable of specific binding of the antagonist [3H]p-MPPF affinity in the nM range, as well as the agonist [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. The ratios of Ki values for the low and high affinity receptor states, by the agonist and antagonist, respectively, were close to unity (Table 9), suggesting that these four would derivatives act as antagonists of 5-HT1A receptors, which can be useful in inhibiting proliferation of prostate tissue occurring in BPH.

5-HT2A - binding percentage of [3H]-ketanserinPreviously it was performed by our group, saturation assays in rat cortex, enriched tissue in 5-HT2A receptors (Neves et al., Bioorg. Med.

This Kd values was used for the calculation of the LDT's Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng &amp; Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099-3108, 1973). The obtained Ki values are summarized in the following Tables 10 and 11. Competition assays in the whole tested range was able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-ketanserin.

Differently than was observed for the 5-HT1A receptors, there is little difference in affinity between the most LDT's (the difference does not exceed 20 times between the Ki values), except with a much lower affinity LDT70 with lower affinity which has 6 times lower than LDT62 (P &lt;0.05). Generally, compared to affinities of LDT's 2-6 and 8, LTD's 62-70 and LDT39 by all the studied receptors, the observed affinities for 5-HT2A receptors are the smallest, as occurs for the derivative with respect to LDT65 α2A adrenergic receptors.
α2A receptors - Percentage of binding of [3H]RX821002In competition assays the LDT's were able to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-RX821002 to the α2A adrenergic receptor, but with lower affinities (µM range, Table 12). The fact that these substances present a low affinity for this receptor is important that there is a high homology between α2A adrenoceptor subtypes. Thus, the tested LDT's are likely to present little blocking of this α2A adrenoceptor which is involved with the regulation of central cardiovascular and nervous male genitourinary systems, by inhibiting the release of

 in these systems, reducing the likelihood of adverse effects.

5-HT1A receptors - intrinsic activityThe Ki value ratios for the states of low and high affinity of the receptor, by antagonist and agonist respectively, were close to the unity for the LDT's 3 and 8 (Table 13), suggesting that these derivatives are 5-HT1A antagonist receptor. Therefore they can be useful in the proliferation inhibition of the prostate tissue that occurs in BPH.

Other non-receptor targets for the treatment of BPHG-protein coupled receptors have structural similarities that difficult the obtaining of selective ligands (reviewed in Oldham &amp; Hamm, Nature 9:60-71, 2008). Additionally, blocking non-target receptors for the disease in question is related to an increased likelihood of adverse effects. Thus, in addition to α2 adrenoceptor (already presented in this text, Table 12), we also conducted the investigation of the action of LDT's on muscarinic and dopaminergic D2 receptors. All LDT's showed a lower affinity for these receptors, and particularly LDT3 and LDT5 with Ki in micromolar range (Tables 14 and 15) in relation to the target receptors, i.e. α1A, α1D adrenoceptor and 5-HTIA receptors. Therefore these LDT's should have little propensity for adverse effects.

Proliferation assays using human prostate cells in vitroLiterature data show that prostate cells expressing the α1A adrenoceptor, α1D adrenoceptor and 5HT1A receptor, wherein α1D adrenoceptor and 5HT1A receptor are related to cell proliferation (DIZEYI et al Prostate 59 (3):328-336, 2004; KOJIMA and cols., Prostate 66:761-767, 2006). In these models, 
tamsulosin
 does not inhibit cell proliferation (DIZEYI et al. Prostate 59 (3) :328-336, 2004).
The analysis of our data showed that the LDT's used in a nanomolar range of concentration in vitro inhibits the stimulation of tumor-origin human prostatic cell. In particular, LDT3 (50 nM) and LDT66 (20 nM) inhibited the effect in face of the α1D receptors and 5-HT1A receptors stimulus (Table 16).

The blocking of the receptors at central level could cause symptoms as described in Table 8. Considering the parameters described in Table 8, none of LDT's (100 mg / kg ip) caused no effect in 14 days, thus ruling out acute toxicity. Importantly, the reduced affinity of LDT's by non target receptors (Tables 2, 4 and 5) contributes to the non-observation of adverse effects (Table 9).
