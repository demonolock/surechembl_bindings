RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/624,483 filed Sep. 21, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/537,307, filed Sep. 21, 2011; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/607,905, filed Mar. 7, 2012; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/607,908, filed Mar. 7, 2012. The entire contents of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany 
dermatological disorders
 are chronic disorders that may only be managed by long-term administration, and even lifetime administration, of various medications. However, many of these medications have serious side effects. For example, 
psoriasis
 and 
eczema
 may be treated with drugs such as topical corticosteroids, immunomodulatory such as 
tacrolimus
 and 
pimecrolimus
, immune suppressants, such as 
cyclosporins azathioprine
 and 
methotrexate
, and biological agents, such as antibodies. The side effects of the foregoing medications include severe 
skin irritation
, sensitivity to the sun, suppression of the immune system, 
anemia
 and 
kidney problems
. These side effects limit the utility of existing therapies due to the risks presented, and exclude patient populations who suffer from preexisting immunocomprised conditions or those whose medication regimen preclude use of other drugs from the classes listed above. Occlusive therapy has been used in 
psoriasis
, but the effects of occlusion on 
psoriasis
 are not completely understood (see e.g., Hwang et al., Internat. J. 
Dermatol
. (2001) 40, 223-231).
Laser- or light-based dermatological procedures such as removal of pigmented lesions, facial rejuvenation, and 
skin tightening
 are increasing in frequency. Possible complications resulting from these procedures include 
erythema
, 
infection
, and 
scarring
. Petrolatum application to the treatment site is a standard post-treatment management practice, as petrolatum is known to facilitate healing of the treatment site. However, topical use of moisturizers often requires multiple applications per day to be effective and to prevent it from wearing off by contact, sweat and other normal activities. Therefore, it is desirable to find alternative methods of treating that are non-invasive and provide treatment without undesirable and dangerous side effects.
Therefore, it is desirable to find alternative methods of treating dermatological disorders, managing post-laser or light or chemical peel treatments in subjects in need thereof, or otherwise improving conditions of compromised skin barrier in subjects in need thereof that are non-invasive and provide treatment without undesirable and dangerous side effects.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONSkin barrier function is critical to skin hydration, disease prevention, and appearance. Compromised skin barrier function has been characterized by increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), decreased skin hydration, and loss of elasticity. Disclosed herein is a description of a safe, flowable, polymer emulsion system that can be activated to form an invisible, breathable, elastic, cosmetically elegant occlusive film that can be comfortably worn to provide remarkable skin hydration and aesthetic benefits. An additional benefit is that the film durability does not require repeated applications to sustain such benefits.
In addition to providing increased compliance with a once-daily application of aesthetically elegant formulations, patients benefit from the immediate cosmetic results, whether during the treatment of a dermatological disorder or following skin ablative and non-ablative procedures that would otherwise require additional downtime. The compositions, formulations, and methods described herein provide a more attractive alternative to current treatment options for dermatological disorders or for management of post-laser or light or chemical peel treatment recovery. First, the film formed is two times more hydrating than petrolatum (see Example 2, below). Second, the film formed is more aesthetically pleasing in that it is invisible and takes on the appearance of natural skin. Additionally the skin surface altering properties provide immediate improvements to the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, skin roughness, redness and periorbital puffiness. Thirdly, the film formed is durable and can be worn over a period of 24 hours without the need to reapply.
In some aspects, the invention provides a composition for treating a dermatological disorder in a subject's skin, in which the composition comprises a) a reactive reinforcing component; and b) a cross-linking component; wherein the cross-linking component catalyzes an in situ cross-linking of the reactive reinforcing component, such that a film is form on the skin.

Eczema is inflammation of the upper layers of the skin, causing itching, blisters, redness, swelling, and sometimes oozing, scabbing and scaling. As used herein “eczema” and “dermatitis” are used interchangeably. Specifically, the particular eczema disorder is selected from the group consisting of atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, xerotic eczema, seborrhoeic dermatitis, dyshidrosis, 
discoid
 eczema, venous eczema, dermatitis herpetiformis, neurodermatitis and autoeczematization.
Atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing, non-contagious and pruritic skin disorder. The skin of a subject with atopic dermatitis reacts abnormally and easily to irritants, food, and environmental allergens and becomes red, flaky and very itchy. It also becomes vulnerable to surface infections caused by bacteria. Atopic dermatitis often occurs together with other atopic diseases like hay fever, asthma and allergic conjunctivitis. It is a familial and chronic disease and its symptoms can increase or disappear over time.
Contact dermatitis is skin inflammation caused by direct contact with a particular substance, such as an allergen (for example, poison ivy or 
nickel
), or an irritant (for example, a detergent, such as 
sodium lauryl sulfate
). A substance may act both as allergen and irritant. Other substances cause a problem after sunlight exposure, bringing on phototoxic dermatitis. Generally, the site of inflammation is itchy, and is confined to a specific area of the body, with the area having defined boundaries.
Xerotic eczema (also known as asteatotic eczema, eczema craquele or craquelatum, winter itch, or pruritus hiemalis) Is very dry skin, usually with fine fissures and cracks traversing through the eczematous plaques.
Seborrheic dermatitis (or seborrheic eczema) is a chronic inflammation of unknown cause that causes scales on the skin (often the scalp or face), and include, for example, dandruff and cradle cap.
Dyshidrosis (also known as dyshidrotic eczema, pompholyx, vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis, or housewife's eczema) is a chronic dermatitis characterized by itchy blisters on the palms of the hand, sides of the fingers or toes, and/or soles of the feet.
Discoid
 eczema (also known as nummular eczema, exudative eczema, microbial eczema) is characterized by round spots with tiny blisters, scabs and scales.
Venous eczema (also known as gravitational eczema, stasis dermatitis, varicose eczema) occurs in people with impaired circulation, such as varicose veins and edema, and is characterized by redness, scaling, darkening of the skin and itching.
Dermatitis herpetiformis (also known as Duhring's Disease) is characterized by intensely itchy and typically symmetrical rash on arms, thighs, knees, and back and is related to celiac disease.
Neurodermatitis (also known as lichen simplex chronicus, localized scratch dermatitis) is an itchy area of thickened, pigmented eczema patch that results from habitual rubbing and scratching.
Autoeczematization is an eczematous reaction to an infection with parasites, fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Retinoid-induced dermatitis occurs in subjects treated with retinoids.
Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease that appears on the skin. Specific types of psoriasis include psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic erythroderma, pustular psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, and guttate psoriasis. The causes of psoriasis are not known, though certain psoriasis triggers have been established, including certain medications. Such medications may trigger one or more of the specific types of psoriasis described below. Drug-induced psoriasis may be induced by beta-blockers, 
lithium
, antimalarials, 
terbinafine
, 
calcium
 channel blockers, 
Inderal
, 
Quinidine
, 
Indomethacin
, 
captopril
, 
glyburide
, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, and lipid-lowering drugs.
Psoriasis vulgaris (also known as plaque psoriasis) is characterized by one or more raised, inflamed, red lesions covered by a silvery white scale.
Psoriatic erythroderma is characterized by periodic, widespread, fiery redness of the skin and the shedding of scales in sheets, rather than smaller flakes. The reddening and shedding of the skin are often accompanied by severe itching and pain, heart rate increase, and fluctuating body temperature.
Pustular psoriasis is characterized by white blisters of noninfectious pus (consisting of white blood cells) surrounded by red skin. Pustular psoriasis includes von Zumbusch, Palmoplantar and Acropustulosis psoriasis.
Inverse psoriasis appears as bright-red lesions that are smooth and shiny and is often found in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in other skin folds around the genitals and the buttocks.
Guttate psoriasis appears as small, red, individual spots on the skin, usually appear on the trunk and limbs. Spots associated with guttate psoriasis are not usually as thick as plaque lesions.
In at least one embodiment, a subject suffering from psoriasis may also suffer from a dermatitis listed herein. For example, seborrheic-like psoriasis is a skin condition characterized by psoriasis with an overlapping seborrheic dermatitis.
Ichthyosis is a family of genetic skin disorders characterized by dry, scaling skin that may be thickened or very thin. Specific types of of ichthyosis include Ichthyosis vulgaris; X-linked ichthyosis; Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, Nonbullous (nbCIE); Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis(bullous ichthyosis, bCIE); Harlequin type ichthyosis; Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens; Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type; Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness; Lamellar ichthyosis, type 1; Lamellar ichthyosis, type 2; Lamellar ichthyosis, type 3; Lamellar ichthyosis, type 4; Lamellar ichthyosis, type 5; CHILD Syndrome; Conradi-Hünermann syndrome; Ichthyosis follicularis with alopecia and photophobia syndrome; Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome; Netherton syndrome; Neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis; Adult Refsum disease: Ichthyosis and male hypogonadism; Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: Photosensitive trichothiodystrophy (IBIDS syndrome).
Ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by fine, polygonal, flat whitish scales that may be darker on distal extremities.
In addition, ichthyosis includes acquired ichthyosis, which is histologically similar to ichthyosis vulgaris, but is not believed to be inherited. Instead, acquired ichthyosis can be a manifestation of systemic disease, and it has been described in association with malignancies, drugs, endocrine and metabolic disease, HIV, infection, and autoimmune conditions.
Xeroderma is characterized by abnormally dry skin and may be a chronic or acute condition.
Specific types of rosacea include erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and granulomatous rosacea. Rosacea is characterized by the presence of one or more of the following primary features: flushing (transient erythema); nontransicnt erythema: papules and pustules: and/or telangiectasia and may include one or more of the following secondary features: burning or stinging, plaque; dry appearance; edema; ocular manifestations; peripheral location; and phymatous changes.
Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (Subtype 1) is mainly characterized by flushing and persistent central facial erythema. The appearance of telangiectases is common but not essential for a diagnosis of this subtype. Central facial edema, stinging and burning sensations, and roughness or scaling may also be reported. A history of flushing alone is common among patients presenting with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.
Papulopustular rosacea (subtype 2) is characterized by persistent central facial erythema with transient papules or pustules or both in a central facial distribution. However, papules and pustules also may occur periorificially (that is, they may occur in the perioral, perinasal, or periocular areas). The papulopustular subtype resembles acne vulgaris, except that comedones are absent. Rosacea and acne may occur concomitantly, and such patients may have comedones as well as the papules and pustules of rosacea. Burning and stinging sensations may be reported by patients with papulopustular rosacea. This subtype has often been seen after or in combination with subtype 1, including the presence of telangiectases. The telangiectases may be obscured by persistent erythema, papules, or pustules, and tend to become more visible after successful treatment of these masking components.
Phymatous rosacea (Subtype 3) includes thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. Rhinophyma is the most common presentation, but phymatous rosacea may occur in other locations, including the chin, forehead, cheeks, and ears. Patients with this subtype also may have patulous, expressive follicles in the phymatous area, and telangiectases may be present. This subtype has frequently been observed after or in combination with subtypes 1 or 2, including persistent erythema, telangiectases, papules, and pustules. In the case of rhinophyma, these additional stigmata may be especially pronouneed in the nasal area.
Granulomatous rosacea is characterized by hard, yellow, brown, or red cutaneous papules or nodules that may be severe and lead to scarring. These lesions tend to be less inflammatory than papules and pustules and sit upon relatively normal-appearing skin. They can vary in size among patients but are monomorphic in each individual patient, and typically appear on the cheeks and periorificial areas. Granulomatous rosacea may occur in locations other than those in which the phymas ate observed. The presence of other rosacea signs is not needed for a diagnosis of the granulomatous rosacea variant.
In at least one embodiment, a dermatological disorder may also include a disease-driven secondary dermatological disorder. A “disease-driven secondary dermatological disorder” refers to a dermatological condition that requires treatment and was caused by or is associated with a non-dermatological disorder. A “non-dermatological disorder” includes disorders not primarily associated with the skin but which may result in, be associated with, or have a secondary manifestation of a skin condition. For example, a non-dermatological disorder includes, for example a disorder of the circulatory system or metabolism of the subject. For example, an ulcer is an example of a disease-driven secondary dermatological disorder. As used herein an ulcer is a sore on the skin or a mucous membrane, accompanied by the disintegration of tissue. Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. In at least one embodiment, the subject with the ulcer has a circulatory or a metabolic disorder that inhibits the wound healing process, such as diabetes mellitus. In at least one embodiment, the ulcer is caused by a bacterial, viral or fungal infection; cancer; pressure (e.g. a bedsore); blood disorders; and/or a chronic wound. Examples of ulcers that may be treated with the invention disclosed herein include diabetic foot ulcer; Arterial insufficiency ulcers (also known as “ischemic ulcers”); neuropathic ulcers (also known as “mal perforans”); or vascular ulcers.
In one embodiment of the invention, the compositions, formulations or films of the invention treat the dermatological disorder of the subject, in addition to masking, concealing, or covering the dermatological disorder.
As used herein “compromised skin barrier function or “compromised skin barrier” includes conditions such dermatological disorders and skin following treatment with light or laser treatment or chemical peel treatment. In at least some embodiments, compromised skin barrier conditions do not include wounds.
In at least one embodiment, a dennatological disorder does not include wounds or skin or body imperfections.
In at least one embodiment, the dermatological disorder is not a skin or body imperfection.

In at least one embodiment, the dermatological disorder is not a wound. The language “wounds” includes injuries to the skin wherein the skin is torn, cut or punctured. A wound is a break in the skin. In one embodiment, the wound is caused by skin contact with a foreign object. The break in the skin may cause external bleeding. Wounds include open wounds, for example, abrasions, lacerations, ineisions, punctures, avulsions, or amputations. Wounds also include burn wounds. A burn is a type of injury to flesh caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, light, radiation or friction. In at least some embodiments, the compromised skin barrier caused by laser or light or chemical peel treatment is not considered to be a wound.
The term “laser treatment” includes any procedure performed by exposing the subject's skin or body to a laser. The laser treatment may be ablative or non-ablative. Representative laser treatments include laser therapies for cosmetic uses or for medical uses, and include, for example, skin rejuvenation; skin resurfacing; stretch marks; scar removal; wrinkle removal or reduction; leg vein or artery removal; tattoo removal; removal of stretch marks, removal of sunspots; removal of birthmarks; telangiectasia; rosacea; angiomas; hemangiomas: reticular veins; port wine stains; liposuction; hair removal, removal of precancerous lesions, and skin cancer surgery.
The term “light treatment” means intensive pulsed light therapy.
The term “chemical peels” include treatment of the skin with a 
glycolic acid
, trichloracetic acid or a 
phenol
 peel where the upper layers of the viable epidermis are removed.
The term “exposed to a laser” or “exposed to a light” means a laser light or light was shone onto the subject's skin or body.
The term “post-laser treatment” means that the subject has undergone a laser treatment prior to treatment with the compositions, formulations, films and methods described herein.
The term “post-light treatment” means that the subject has undergone a light treatment prior to treatment with the compositions, formulations, films and methods described herein.
The compositions, compositions, formulations or films of the invention may be applied to the subject any point in time after undergoing the laser or light or chemical peel treatment. Any amount of time between the laser or light or chemical peel treatment and the use of the method disclosed herein is contemplated. Specifically, the subject may immediately use the compositions, formulations, films and methods described herein immediately following the laser or light or chemical peel treatment procedure, or any time thereafter. Specifically, the subject may wait 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 hours to initiate the methods described herein. In at least one embodiment, the compositions, formulations or films of the invention are applied following eschar or scab formation. One of skill in the art would be able to determine when and for how long the treatment is useful.
The terms “treat,” “treatment” and “treating” includes both disorder modifying treatment and symptomatic treatment. In some embodiments, treatment ameliorates or causes a reduction in the severity and/or duration of at least one symptom of the dermatologicai disorder. In some embodiments, treatment causes a complete recovery from the dermatological disorder. In some embodiments, treatment ameliorates or causes a reduction in the severity and/or duration of at least one symptom of the complications arising from laser or light or chemical peel treatment. In some embodiments, treatment causes a complete recovery from the laser or light or chemical peel treatment procedure.
The terms “apply,” “applied” and “application” includes methods of contacting or administering the composition or formulation disclosed herein to a subject's skin or body, such as application by fingers, brush, cotton ball, pad, spray, sponge, cotton swab, roll-on and the like. One of skill in the art can readily determine appropriate methods to apply the compositions disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the composition is applied to the subject's skin at the site of the dermatological disorder (e.g., at about the area of the skin where the dermatological disorder occurs). In some embodiments, the composition is applied to the subject's skin at or around the site of the laser or light or chemical peel treatment (e.g., at about the area of the skin that was laser or light or chemically treated).
In treating a dermatological disorder, one of skill in the an (for example, a medical practitioner such as a physician) would first identify the area on the subject's body affected by the dermatological disorder. A pre-treatment of the area (for example, washing, shaving, or otherwise preparing the area for treatment) may be completed, if necessary. After the optional pretreatment, the reactive reinforcing component and the crosslinking component are applied to the area in need of treatment either sequentially or in combination to form the film over the entire or over a portion of the area in need of treatment, thereby treating the dermatological disorder. The amount of both the reactive reinforcing component and/or the crosslinking component is determined by the size and location of the area to be treated as well as the type of disorder to be treated. The film may be left over the area until the dermatological disorder resolves, or improves, or after a period of time as determined by the skilled practitioner or by the subject suffering from the disorder. The film can be removed by use of the film removing cleanser as described herein. The treatment can be repeated as many times as needed in order to achieve a desired result.
In treating a subject post-laser or light or chemical peel treatment, one of skill in the art (for example, a medical practitioner such as a physician) would first identify the area on the subject's skin or body that was laser or light or chemeially treated. A pre-treatment of the area (for example, washing, shaving, or otherwise preparing the area for treatment) may be completed, if necessary. After the optional pretreaiment, the reactive reinforcing component and the crosslinking component are applied to the area in need of treatment either sequentially or in combination to form the film over the entire or over a portion of the area in need of treatment, thereby treating the subject post-laser or light or chemical peel treatment. The area treated with the the compositions, formulations, films and methods of the invention may also include area that were not exposed during tlie laser or light or chemical peel treatment. The amount of both the reactive reinforcing component and/or the crosslinking component is determined by the size and location of the area to be treated and/or the type laser or light or chemical peel treatment used. The film may be left over the area until the effects of the laser or fight or chemical peel treatment resolves, or improves, or after a period of time as determined by the skilled practitioner or by the subject. The film can be removed by use of the film removing cleanser as described herein. The treatment can be repeated as many times as needed in order to achieve a desired result.
In certain embodiments, the reactive reinforcing component is first applied to the skin and then a cross-linking component is applied over the reactive reinforcing component. In other embodiments, the cross-linking component is first applied to the skin and then a reactive reinforcing omponeni is applied over the cross-linking component.
The language “therapeutic formulation” or “formulation” includes a composition (or “a therapeutic composition”) that, when applied to the body of a subject, in need of treatment, form a film (or “therapeutic film”) on the body resulting in a therapeutic benefit to the subject.

In some embodiments, the organopolysiloxane is a high viscosity organopolysiloxane, a low viscosity organopolysiloxane or a combination thereof. When the organopolysiloxane is a combination of high and low viscosity organopolysiloxanes, the combination of a high viscosity and a low viscosity 
vinyl
 organosiloxane provides a bimodal distribution of organosiloxane molecular weights. In at least one embodiment, the organopolysiloxane is a combination of high and low viscosity vinyl-terminal organopolysiloxanes providing a bimodal distribution of the vinyl-terminated organopolysiloxane. In one embodiment, the organopolysiloxane is a combination of formulas I, II, IIa, IIb, and IIc, specifically, of formula IIa, IIb and/or IIc, or more specifically, of formula IIb and IIc, providing a bimodal distribution of the vinyl-terminated organopolysiloxane. In one embodiment, the bimodal distribution of polymer molecular weight is represented by a ratio of the molecular weights (for example, the sum of s and t) of the high viscosity organopolysiloxanes to the low viscosity organopolysiloxane. In one embodiment, this ratio is from 2 to 3. In a specific embodiment, this ratio is 2.5.
The term “viscosity” refers to the measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear stress or tensile stress. Viscosity may be reported as either dynamic viscosity, also absolute viscosity, (typical units Pa·s, Poise, P, cP) or kinematic viscosity (typical units cm2/s, Stokes, St. cSt), which is the dynamic viscosity divided by the density. Thus, if and when the density of a fluid is approximately 1, then the dynamic viscosity and the kinematic viscosity are equivalent. One of skill in the art would understand that the density of the fluid may vary with temperature or pressure, and as such would be able to adjust such measurements accordingly. One of skill in the art without undue experimentation would be able to determine how to measure the viscosity of a fluid, for example, using a viscometer or a rheometer. Representative methods include use of a capillary viscometer, rotational viscometer or rheometer to measure viscosity at an instrument specific strain. Specific methods for determining the viscosity of a fluid are shown in Example 5.

In some embodiments, the pigment dispersion formulation may be applied to skin that has not been subjected to the application of a therapeutic formulation or film. For example, a subject may apply the pigment dispersion formulation to the skin in the area around the therapeutic film or formulation, or the subject may apply the pigment formulation to the skin in lieu of applying the therapeutic film or formulation.
In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a kit comprising a therapeutic formulation comprising a reactive reinforcing component and a cross-linking component. In some embodiments, the kit is a multi-compartment kit comprising at least two compartments in which one compartment comprises the reactive reinforcing component and the second compartment comprises the cross linking component. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for use of the kit, one or more brushes, one or more swabs, a film removing cleanser or a mirror. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises one or more finishing formulations.
In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a therapeutic film prepared by a process comprising the steps of applying a reactive reinforcing component to the body; and applying a cross-linking component to ihe reactive reinforcing component, in which the cross-linking component catalyzes an in situ cross-linking of the reactive reinforcing component.
In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a therapeutic film prepared by a process comprising the steps of applying a cross-linking component to the body; and applying a reactive reinforcing component to the cross-linking component, in which the cross-linking component catalyzes an in situ cross-linking of the reactive reinforcing component.
In some embodiments, the film has the appearance of natural skin upon application to the skin. The language “appearance of natural skin” includes the perception that the film, when applied to the skin, has the look, feel and texture of real skin and that the film treated skin has the physical properties (e.g., the elasticity and stiffness) of real (e.g., live) skin. A trained observer and/or a technician would be able to determine whether the film upon application to the body has the appearance of natural skin. For example, a trained observer would be able to determine whether the film, upon application to the body, appears excessively shiny, or whether the film appears not to move with the underlying musculature of the skin by, for example, breaking, buckling or deforming, in response to natural skin motion.
A technician would be able to determine whether the film has the appearance of natural skin upon application to the body. For example, the elasticity and stiffness of skin, with or without the film applied to it, can be assessed by a wide variety of methods (Agache et al., Arch. 
Dermatol
. Rev., 269 (3980) 221), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, the DermaLab suction cup instrument provides one common method to assess the mechanical properties of skin, and has previously shown younger skin to be less stiff and more elastic than aged skin (Grahame et al. Clinical Science 39 (1970) 223-238, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference). With this method, the stiffness of the skin is indicated by the Young's Modulus, a measure calculated by the instrument based on the pressure required to suck skin up a predetermined distance.
In some embodiments, the Young's Modulus of the skin treated with the film is reduced by between about 5% to about 10%, for example, between about 30% and about 60%, or between about 40% and about 50% compared to untreated skin. In some embodiments, the Young's Modulus of skin treated with the film is reduced by between about 5% and about 25% compared to untreated skin.
The elasticity of the skin is determined by the skin retraction time. The retraction time is obtained by measuring the time it takes for the skin to drop a predetermined distance towards its natural position, after the suction pressure is removed. In some embodiments, the retraction time of skin treated with the film is decreased by between about 5% and about 15%, for example, between about 30% and about 60%, or about 50% and about 65% when compared to untreated skin. In some embodiments, the retraction time of skin treated the film is decreased by between about 5% and about 10% compared to untreated skin. In some embodiments, the retraction time of the skin treated with the fdm approaches the retraction time of the film alone.
In some embodiments, the Hint upon application to the skin, has (he appearance and physical properties of youthful, unblemished natural skin. The language “youthful skin” includes skin that has mild or no damage, as measured by the Griffith's score. The Griffith's score (GS), as shown below, is a quantitative measurement of the amount of skin damage subject has.
1. 0-1: No damage2. 2-3: Mild damage3. 4-5: Moderate damage4. 6-7: Moderate to severe damage5. 8-9: Severe damage

In some embodiments, youthful skin includes skin that has a Griffith's score of between about 0 and about 3.
In some embodiments, the subject's skin has a negative change in Griffith's score (ΔGS) of about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7 or about 8 after application of the film. In some embodiments, the subject's skin has a AGS of between about −0.5 and about −3.0 upon application of the film. In one embodiment, the subject's skin has a AGS between about −1 and about −1.5, between about −1.2 and about −1.3 (e.g., about −1.25) upon application of the film. In another embodiment the subject's skin has a AGS of between about −2.0 and about −3.0. for example, between about −2.0 and about −2.5, or between about −2.1 and about −2.2 (e.g., about −2.15) upon application of the film.
In other embodiments, the film, upon application to the skin, provides stiffness and elasticity such that the skin treated with the film appear substantially more similar to youthful skin than untreated skin. The term “elasticity” includes the skin's tendency to return to its original shape once it's been deformed. The language “elasticity substantially similar to youthful skin” includes the ability of the skin to return to its original shape once it's been deformed in a manner similar to that of young skin. The term “stiffness” includes the skin's resistance to deformation. The language “stiffness substantially similar to youthful skin” includes the ability of the skin to resist deformation in a manner similar to that of young skin. A technician would also be able to determine whether the film, upon application to the body, has the aforementioned physical properties of youthful, unblemished, natural skin by the techniques described above (e.g., using the Dermalab suction cup instrument).
In some embodiments, the subject and/or observers of the subject perceive an age reduction upon application of the film. In some embodiments, the perceived age reduction is about 1 year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years, about 5 years, about 6 years, about 7 years, about 8 years, about 9 years, about 10 years, about 11 years, about 12 years, about 13 years, about 14 years or about 15 years less than the subject's actual age. In some embodiments, the perceived age reduction is about 7.5 years less than the subject's actual age upon application of the film. In other embodiments, the perceived age reduction is about 8.5 years less than the subject's actual age upon application of the film.
The language “the film is formed” and “film formation” includes the results of the polymerization reaction that occurs upon the interaction of the reactive reinforcing component and the cross-linking component. Without being bound by theory, film formation is characterized by a phase transition from the viscous sol state of a mixture to that of a continuous interconnected polymer state of film.
A technician could determine when the film is formed on the skin by using routine methods. For example, rheological measurements using small amplitude oscillatory shear can determine the continuous evolution of the viscoelastic properties, such as elastic modulus (G′), the viscous modulus (G″) and the loss of tangent (tan δ) of the reacting mixture continuously through the film formation process. In some embodiments, the rlteometer can be used to determine the cross over time between G′ and G″ and the time when tan δ becomes frequency independent, which is a measure of film formation. In some embodiments, the film is formed within at least about five minutes, for example, within about one minute, about two minutes, about three minutes or about four minutes. In some embodiments, the film is formed within at least about 10 seconds and about 3 minutes.
In some embodiments, the film has a Young's Modulus (e.g., tensile strength) of between about 0.01 and about 1 MPa.
In some embodiments, the fracture strain of the film has a fracture strain of at least about 150%.
In some embodiments, the film has a leather adhesive force of greater than about 20 N/mm, for example, greater than about 25 N/mm, greater than about 30 N/mm, greater than about 35 N/mm, greater than about 40 N/mm, greater than about 45 N/mm, greater than about 50 N/mm, greater than about 55 N/mm, greater than about 60 N/mm, greater than about 65 N/mm, greater than about 70 N/mm, greater than about 75 N/mm, or greater than about 80 N/mm. In one embodiment, the leather adhesive force is between about 50 and about 80 N/mm.
In some embodiments, the film has a hysteresis of less than about 10% for example, least than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than 1% or about 0%.
In some embodiments, the film is between about 10 μm and about 1500 μm thick, for example, between about 50 μm and about 500 μm thick. In some embodiments, the film is less man about 100 μm thick. In some embodiments, the film is less than about 75 μm thick. The film thickness may be measured by methods known to one of skill in the art, for example, by the combination of calipers and a caIIbrated microscope. The thickness of the film may also be digitally measured from a micrograph of the film cross-section. The microscope calibration allows for the conversion of measured pixelar distance into metric distance units.
In some embodiments, the film shrinks by less than between about 1 and 30%, for example, between about 1 to about 15%. The amount of shrinking may be determined by methods known to one of skill in the art, for example, by the Croll method (Croll, S. G. J. Coatings Tech. 52 (1980) 35, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference). In this method the film is used to coat one side of a thin flexible substrate. The amount of curve developed in the substrate due to the shrinking of the coating is used to calculate the magnitude of shrinking of the coating (Francis et al., J Mater Set 2002; 37:4717-31, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.)
In some embodiments, the film is physiologically stable. The language “physiologically stable” includes the durability of the film upon exposure to normal skin conditions, for example, humidity, tears, sweat or sebum. The physiological stability may be determined by methods typically used by one of ordinary skill in the art, such as an uptake test, which measures the change in weight of the film after exposure to a physiological factor. For example, the uptake test may employ a formulation of simulated sweat (e.g., 1× 
phosphate
 buffered saline solution) or simulated sebum (e.g., 25% wax monoesters, 41% triglycerides, 16% free fatty acids and 12% 
squalene
). In some embodiments, the weight of the film inereases by less than about 10%, for example, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than 4%, less than 3%, less than 2%, less than 1% or exhibits no increase upon exposure to humidity, tears, sweat or sebum.

EXAMPLE 2Hydration StudyI. ObjectiveTo evaluate the effects of the test products utilizing measurements of skin hydration and elasticity. Skin hydration has been shown to significantly improve skin conditions and quality of life for patients suffering from conditions of compromised skin barrier such as subjects suffering from dermatological disorders or recovering from light or laser treatment. Skin hydration prov ides transient relief from irritation. Subsequently, an improved barrier function and stratum corneum hydration makes the epidermis more resistant to external stressors and reduces the induction of Koebner phenomena (excoriation, maceration and infectious foci (Streptococcus pyogenes)). Therefore, treatments that result in enhanced hydration of the subject's skin may be useful in treating subjects suffering from conditions of compromised skin barrier including dermatological disorders or subjects recovering from laser or light or chemical peel treatment. In addition, hydration of skin is useful in relieving or resolving the symptoms of such conditions including symptoms such as itchy skin; flaking or peeling skin; blisters on skin; redness or swelling of the skin; or oozing, scabbing and scaling skin.
II. Experimental DesignA. General ConsiderationsThe experimental design was based on previous studies by several different investigators which have been published as follows:
M. Obata and H. Tagami. A rapid in vitro test to assess skin moisturizers. J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 41, 235-241 (July/August, 1990) and P. Agache, S. Mary, P. Muret, A. M. Matta, P. Humbert. Assessment of the-Water Content of the Stratum corneum using a Sorption-Desorption Test. Dermatology, 2001, 202:308-313, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Brief Description of the ProtocolFive panelists participated in this study. There were 6 test sites, 3 on each volar forearm of the selected panelists. Four of the six volar forearm test sites will be treated (randomized) and two sites will remain non-treated to serve as controls. Following Baseline measurements with a Skicon-200 Conductance Meter, cyberDERM RGI Evaporimeter and DermaLab Suction Cup the test products were applied to 4 of the 6 sites and the remaining two sites served as non-treated controls. Follow-up measurements with the evaporimeter and suction cup were taken from each of the six volar forearm test sites approximately 4 hours after treatment. After the 4-hour TEWL and suction cup volar forearm measurements have been completed, the test product will be removed from the 4 volar forearm test sites. Conductance measurements will be taken from the 6 volar forearm sites immediately and 5, 10 and 15 minutes after removal. Post removal TEWL and suction cup measurements will be taken from the volar forearm sites following completion of the 15-minute post removal conductance measurements. The panelists will be required to acclimate in an environmentally controlled room for approximately 25-30 minutes prior to all measurements.

Agrees to discontinue use of all moisturizing products (soaps, lotions, sunscreens, insect repellent, etc.) on their arms for the 3 days prior to their day of testingc. Agrees to refrain from exercising and/or drinking hot or caffeinated beverages during the 2 hours prior to their appointment on the day of testing (this affects the measurements)d. Willing to remain at the lab until their 4 hour measurements are completed on the day of testinge. Willing to wear a short-sleeved shirt or a shirt with sleeves that can be pulled or rolled above the elbows to each visitf. Willing to wear non-occlusive, non-contact protective arm guards in between product application and their 4-hour measurements on the day of testingg. Willing and able to follow all study requirements and restrictionsh. Is able to read, understand, and sign the consent form.

2. Exclusion Criteria
a. Is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnaney as determined by interview.b. Is currently going through menopause (i.e., experieneing hot flashes).c. Is a smoker.d.

Have known sensitivities to adhesives, cosmetics, moisturizers or fragrances.g. Any other condition or factor the Investigator or his duly assigned representative believes may affect the skin response or the interpretation of the test results.

Each volunteer signed a consent form and HIPAA Authorization form after being informed as to their obligations and any risks that they might eneounter as a participant in this study.
Each candidate was instructed to stop the use of all moisturizing products (soaps, lotions, sunscreens, insect repellent, etc.) on their arms during a 3 day pre-conditioning period prior to testing. Candidates were instructed not to exercise or drink hot or caffeinated beverages within 2 hours prior to their day of testing visit as this will affect the measurements. They were also instructed to wear a short-sleeved shirt or a shirt with sleeves that can be pulled or rolled above the elbows to each visit.
C. Treatments and ProceduresPrior to Baseline acclimation, the test areas on each panelist was cleansed with Kimwipes wetted with water and patted dry with dry Kimwipes. The cleansing should be as minimal as wiping twice with wet Kimwipes and subsequent patted drying by stroking twice with dry Kimwipes.
Six 5 cm by 5 cm test sites on the left and right volar forearms (3 on each arm) using a standard template were outlined on each panalist. The panelists were instructed to keep their arms air-exposed for the duration of this study and not to touch their arms during the study.
1.IBS Skicon-200 Conductance Meter Measurements (Skin Hydration)All measurements were taken following a 25-30 minute acclimation period in a controlled environment with the relative humidity maintained at less than 50% and temperature maintained at 19-22° C.
As has been shown, most notably by Obata and Tagami [Obata, M. and Tagami, H. A rapid in vitro test to assess skin moisturizers. In: J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 41, 235-241 (July/August, 1990), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference], the ability of an alternating current to flow through the stratum corneum is an indirect measure of its water content. The value recorded which is expressed in units of microsiemens represents the AC conductance 2-3 seconds after placing the spring-loaded probe tip to the sample site. This timing interval is sufficiently long enough for the electronic circuits to stabilize in response to this change in conductance but short enough not to be influenced by an increased hydration at the probe tip due to its being occlusive and acting as a hindrance to the normal water loss at the test site.
In this study, an IBS Skicon-200 Conductance Meter equipped with a Measurement Technologies probe to further enhance its ability to measure changes in skin surface hydration was used. It was anticipated that skin occlusion or treatment with a moisturizer will produce increased conductance values.
Three conductance measurements from each of the six volar forearm test sites at Baseline were taken. Following completion of the 4 hour TEWL and suction cup measurements (as described below), the test products removal sequentially from each test site and another series of measurements were taken immediately and again every 5 minutes for 15 minutes.
2.CyberDERM RG1 Evaporimeter Measurements (Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL))All water loss measurements were taken following a 25-30 minute acclimation period in a controlled environment with the relative humidity maintained at less than 50% and temperature maintained at 19-22° C.
At Baseline, evaporative water loss measurements were taken from each of the test sites as described below. Any individuals with water loss values outside the normal range (&gt;10.0 gms/m2 hr) were excluded at this time.
Evaporative water loss measurements provide an instrumental assessment of skin barrier function. These measurements were made using a recently calibrated cyberDERM RG1 Evaporimeter System (Broomall, Pa.) with TEWL Probes that are manufactured by Cortex Technology (Hadsund, Denmark) and available in the US through cyberDERM, inc. (Broomall, Pa.).
This instrument is based on the vapor pressure gradient estimation method as designed by Nilsson and initially utilized by the Servo Med Evaporimeter. There are slight dimensional differences and the sensor technology is greatly improved in the DermaLab® TEWL probe but the underlying prineiples of the measurement remain the same. Both probes contain two sensors that measure the temperature and relative humidity at two fixed points along the axis normal to the skin surface. This arrangement is such that the device can electronically derive a value that corresponds to evaporative water loss expressed in gm/m2 hr. Evaporimetry with TEWL Probe is more fully described in two publications by Grove et al: Grove, G. L., M. J. Grove, C. Zerweck and E. Pierce: Comparative metrology of the evaporimeter and the DermaLab® TEWL probe. Skin Res. &amp; Tech. 5:1-8, 1999 and Grove, G. I., M. J. Grove, C. Zerweck and E. Pierce: Computerized evaporimetry using the DermaLab® TEWL probe. Skin Res. &amp; Tech. 5:9-13, 1999, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The guidelines established for using the Servo Med Evaporimeter as described by Pinnagoda [Pinnagoda, J., R. A. Tupker, T. Anger and J. Serup. Guidelines for transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement. In: Contact Dermatitis 1990: 22:164-178, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference] are quite appropriate for the DermaLab® TEWL Probe as well.
The cyberDERM RG1 Evaporimeter System is completely computerized and continuously communicates with its PC through a USB port and associated cyberDERM, inc. software for the Evaporimeters. The application program entitled x1WL2M that captures the water loss data from the attached evaporimeter at a sampling rale of 8 inputs/secondwas used. These inputs were graphed as a real time display on the computer monitor. The extracted value refers to the average evaporative water loss rate collected over a twenty-second interval once steady state conditions had been achieved. These were directly transferred to an Excel file using a DDE link.
At Baseline, approximately 4 hours after treatment and again post removal of the test products, duplicate water loss readings were taken from each volar forearm site and electronically recorded using a spreadsheet format based on Excel software that computes the average value for each test site. These values were also manually recorded on a worksheet that serves as a back up in case of possible computer malfunction. Such measures provide a noninvasive method for determining the barrier function of the stratum corneum.
3. DermaLab® USB with a Suction Cup (Skin Elasticity Via Measurements of Skin Recoil Time)All water loss measurements were taken following a 25-30 minute acclimation period in a controlled environment with the relative humidity maintained at less than 50% and temperature maintained at 19-22° C.
A DermaLab® USB with a Suction Cup was used to evaluate skin elasticity. The suction probe which was placed on the test site is capable of producing a vacuum up to 65 kPa. Within the suction chamber there were 2 light beams set at fixed distances from the skin surface. The measuring aperture was 10 mm in diameter and the probe itself had an ultra low weight of approximately 7 g for minimum skin bias. The probe was secured to the panelist's site using an adhesive ring. When the suction pump was activated it created a vacuum that drew the skin into the chamber. The pressure required to draw the skin to the point where it blocks the lower light beam was recorded. The pump remained on and the skin continues to draw into the chamber to the point that it eventually blocked the upper light beam as well. The skin was then allowed to relax for 10 seconds before the vacuum resumed for a total of 5 cycles. The time it took for the skin to retract through the light beams to its natural state is reported and referred to as the “retraction time”. The geometry of the suction cup standard probe was such that the 10 mm diameter section of the skin being sampled was extended approximately 2% and 12% when lifted to these respective levels. As both the stress and strain at these 2 points is known, the “stiffness” ratio that is similar to Young's Modulus for more ideal materials can be computed. The results obtained with the DermaLab® Suction Cup in terms of a stiffness index:
Δ preesure in KPa

Δ distance in mm

Skin that is firm and taut will have a much higher stiffness index than skin that is loose and saggy.
The one measurement from each site at Baseline, 4 hoars post treatment and again post removal of the test products was taken. At each of these time points, suction cup measurements were taken after the TEWL measurements were completed. Measurements were taken from the same location for each site.
4. Test Product &amp; Treatment Proceduresa. Test ProductsThe 2-step test product: LP Product A (Treatment) and LP Product B (Perfector) designed as LP A+B.
Control: Vaseline (Petrolatum)
b. Test Product ApplicationSix test sites were located on the left and right volar forearms, with three sites on each arm. Each site was approximately 5 cm×5 cm in size.
After the Baseline assessments and measurements are completed, the test sites for each panelist were treated according to the randomization schedule described below. Products were applied in duplicate with each product being applied to one site on each arm. One site on each arm remained non-treated to serve as untreated controls.

Application of the 2-Step Test ProductAn aliquot of 0.08-0.1 mL was dispensed to finger cot and then directly applied to the test area. The two materials are applied to the same test area, the first test material (LP Product A, 0.08 mL) was applied to skin first and the second test material (LP Product B, 0.1 mL) was dispensed with a new finger cot and applied onto the same area treated with the first test material by gliding motion to coat the treated area but not by rubbing in to minimize the mixing of the two test materials.
Application of VaselineTo the test site, 0.05 cc of test material using a graduated 1.0 cc syringe was delivered and then a finger cot was used to gently spread an even film of the product over the test area.
Panelists were required to wear non-occlusive, non-contact protective arm guards to minimize product transfer and site contact with foreign material following application of the test products and until their 4-hour measurements were completed. The panelists were sequestered at the facility until their 4-hour measurements were completed.
c. Test Product RemovalRemoval After 4 HoursAll the test area will be cleansed with 88-116 removal tonic. The removal tonic was shaken well to be homogenious prior to use. The removal tonic (1.5 mL) was poured onto a cotton round pad and then the wet pad was placed on the test area. After 30 seconds of the ineubation, the testing product(s) was removed by gently wiping against the boundary of the treatment and rolling the product off the treated area. Severe rubbing or adding additional pressure was avoided. Upon removal, the area was cleaned with Kimwipes wetted with water and patted dry with dry Kimwipes. All three test area including Vaseline and untreated control was removed and cleansed as above
E. Statistical AnalysisThe sorted data was tabulated and arranged in order of panelist number for every point of evaluation. Due to the small sample size, a full statistical analysis was not warranted. For all analysis, a two-tailed p≦0.05 will be taken as the level of significance.
6. Results1. IBS Skicon-200 Conductance MeasurementsThe film treatment sites demonstrated a two-fold inerease in the skin conductance when compared with petrolatum after removal of each substance (p&lt;0.05). (FIG. 1). The greatest inerease was associated with LP A+B treated sites while untreated sites demonstrated the least inerease in hydration.
2.CyberDERM RG1 Water Loss MeasurementsEvaporative water loss measurements show that both LP A+B and vaseline were relatively occlusive 4 hours post application. Specifically, TEWL values were significantly lower for petrolatum and LP A+B as compared to the blank control site prior to removal (p&lt;0.05). Differences were not detected between LP A+B and petrolatum. Upon removal of lite Ftlms water loss values are found to return toward Baseline levels. Little or no change was associated with the no treatment controls.
EXAMPLE 3DermaLab Suction Cup Measurements (Skin Elasticity)Similar to the protocol described above in Example 2, an additional study was conducted to evaluate the skin elasticity of the LP A+B film. Vaseline and untreated blank control. Six voluntary participants were selected for the study as described in the protocol above in Example 2. A baseline measurement was determined by DermaLab Suction Cup on live volar arm test area. Next, the test areas were treated with LP A+B as described above in Example 2. The skin retraction times were determined by DermaLab Suction Cup at 4 hour post treatment and also immediately after removal. The results are summarized below:

ConclusionSkin retraction times were significantly reduced by 30% when LP A+B was applied (P&lt;0.05) as compared to baseline, hence, providing greatly improved skin recoil properties. The results described above in Examples 2 and 3 highlight the utility and benefit of the LP A+B film as compared to petrolatum treatment for skin with compromised barrier function. The superior hydration benefits, coupled with the ease of application, film durability and cosmetic aesthetics, makes this polymer emulsion system a compelling alternative for management of skin in dermatological disorders such as lichen simplex chronicus, cutaneous lupus, psoriasis, eczema, chronic dry skin, xeroderma, rosacea, ichthyosis, or an ulcer, or any combination thereof.
EXAMPLE 4Evaluation of Clinical Efficiency for Management of Specific Skin ConditionsBackgroundEmollient based moisturizers are often considered an adjuvant therapy and an essential part of the management of many dry skin conditions such as dermatitis and psoriasis to inerease hydration of the keratin of stratum comeum (SC).
Topical use of moisturizers often requires multiple applications per day to be effective and to prevent it from wearing off by contact, sweat and other normal activities. Emollient base moisturizers can also cause a few side effects, such as irritant dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, allergy to formula constituents, stinging, cosmetic acne, and other undesired effects.
In comparison with other emollient based moisturizers in terms of occlusion and efficiency of skin hydration, formulations of described herein are unobtrusive to the normal activity of the wearers having potential for the convenient (single application per day), localized, prolonged moisturization effect to the skin.
Evaluation of the use of the formulation described herein are described below,
Atopic Dermatitis (AD)Experimental DesignSubjects24 to 48 patients with AD based upon the criteria proposed by Haffin and Rajka (1980)1 including male and female with no age restrictions. Patients will be interviewed about the disease duration of AD, other atopic disorders including asthma or allergic rhinitis, and other seasonal difference in AD severity and their treatment history such as steroids, moisturizer or oral anti-histamines. Patient questionnaires are also given to patients for self evaluations on severity of conditions and life quality such as sleep pattern.
Inclusion Criteria1. Male and female at any age
2 Agrees to refrain from exercising and/or drinking hot or caffeinated beverages during the 2 hours prior to their appointment on the day of testing (this affects the measurements)
3.Willing and able to follow all study requirements and restrictions
4.Is able to read, understand, and sign the consent form.
Exclusion Criteriaa. Is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnaney as determined by interview.
b. Is currently going through menopause (i.e., experieneing hot flashes).
c. Is a smoker.
d. Any other condition or factor the Investigator or his duly assigned representative believes may affect the skin response or the interpretation of the test results.
Each patient is NOT instructed to stop the use of all moisturizing products (soaps, lotions, sunscreens, insect repellent, etc.) during a 3 day pre-conditioning period prior to testing which is usually instructed to follow for regular hydration studies. However, patients is instructed not to exercise or drink hot or caffeinated beverages within 2 hours prior to their day of testing visit as this will affect the measurements.
Treatments and ProceduresAnyone with marks, scars, scratches or any skin condition and dry skin are NOT excluded at this time. Two or six 5 cm by 5 cm test sites are outlined on the subject's skin on disease affected skin (skin lesion) and normal looking skin using a standard template.
Test ProductsThe test products are labeled as follows:
Test ArticleDescriptionAN109 - Product 1 PDMSSkin care primer cream (Step1)complexAN 109- Product 2 ActivatorSkin care serum (Step 2)
Test Product ApplicationProducts will be applied in two to six lesions identified as disease affected skin and in two to three normal looking skin area.
2-Step Test Product (AN 109-Product 1 and 2)The AN 109-1 and 2 are applied once a day throughout 2 weeks daily. An aliquot of 0.08-0.1 mL is dispensed to finger and then directly applied to the lest area. The two materials are applied to the same test area, the first test material (AN109-H1, 0.08 mL per 5 cm2 area) is applied to skin first and the second test material (LPS 021, 0.1 mL per 5 cm2) is dispensed with a new finger cot and applied onto the same area treated with the first test material by gliding motion to coat the treated area but not by rubbing in to minimize the mixing of the two lest materials.
Removal Before Clinical MeasurementsAll the test area is cleansed with AN 109-Remover. The remover is shaken well to be homogeneous prior to use. The removal tonic (1.5 mL per 5 cm2) is be poured onto a cotton round pad and then the wet pad is placed on the test area.
Clinincal MeasurementsI. Disease severity: SCORAD (severity scoring of AD. score range of 0-103; European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis, 1993) utilizes the rule of nines with six clinical features of AD disease intensity (eythema/darkening, edema/population, oozing/crust, excoriations, lichenification/prurigo, and dryness).II. Children's Dermatology Life Quality index (CDLQI) or DLQI: DLQI2 for adults and CDLQI3 for children were evaluated by the questionnaire to measure how much a patient's disease had affected their lives over the last weeks. The response to each questionnaire was defined as 0-3 (0=not at all affected; 3=very much affected), DLQI was summarized under six subscales: “Symptoms and feelings;” “Leisure;” “Personal relationships;” “Treatment;” “Work and school;” and “Daily activities.” TheCDLQI was summarized under six subscales: “Symptoms and feelings;” “Leisure;” “Personal relationships;” “Treatment;” “School or holidays;” and “Sleep.” Total QOL score was calculated by summing the score of each question. Total QOL score and the six subscales were expressed as a percentage of the respective maximum scores. The reliability and validity of DLQI were assured in the review4.III. TEWL and Conductance: Protocol is as described above in Example 2IV. Tape Stripping: Qunatificaiion of the number of sequential D-squame tape strippings required to inerease TEWL by 20 g/m2 per hourV. Stratum Comeum (SC) Thickness: SC thickness is calculated from low-frequency susceptance and high-frequency admittance by the comeometer as (square root of low-frequency susceptance)/(high-frequency admittance ). SC thickness is also visualized by conventional inmmunohistostaining.VI. Immunohistochemical staining: Immunoperoxidase staining of paraffin-embedded sections is performed using the ChemMate Peroxidase/DAB system (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) to visualize the Sc and epidermal structure, epidermal thickness and extracellular lamellar membranes.VII. Laboratory tests: Peripheral blood EOS count (number 100 per ml; normal 40-440), serum LDH (IU I−1l; normal 119-229), total sernm IgE (IU ml−1; normal 0.0-400.0), and allergen-specific IgE (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) are measured. Allergen-specific IgE were estimated by fluoroenzyme immunoassays for house dust, mite allergen, grass pollen (Tancy), cedar pollen, fungal allergen (Candida), animal dander, and foods. Concerning to the sensitivity for detection of specific IgE 100 lumicount and values greater than or equal to 100 lumicount are considered positive (+).VII. Statistical analysis: Simple regression analyses are also used to identify significant associations of SC hydration, thickness, or TEWL to OSCORAD. Data with P-values less than 0.05 are evaluated as significant. We interpret P-values less than 0.005 as highly significant. Wilcoxon rank sum test and simple regression analyses are performed to assess the association or correlation between different biological markers including IgE, LDH, EOS, and the OSCORAD.
Expected ResultsImproved SCORAD and DLQI and decreased TEWL over both disease affected and unaffected normal looking skin are expecte. The decrease in TEWL is in parallel with SCORAD score. Both SC integrity measure by epidermal thickness and hydration are improved slowly but significantly during 2 week treatment period. The ultrastructure of the SC treated with AN 109-Product 1 and 2 shows improved SC integrity and barrier function and subsequently reduces inflammation by “barrier repair” achieved with application of AN 109-1 and 2.1 Hannifin J M, Rajka G (1980) Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis.

II. PsoriasisBackgroundPsoriasis affects 2-3% of the world's population and has one of the biggest impacts on quality of life of any dermatological disorder. Treatment is extremely costly and prevention of disease progression in severity and extent is crucial. Emollients and moisturizers are essential in the topical treatment of psoriasis. They are adjuvants for classic treatments and help to reduce the scale load of individual patients. Skin hydration has been shown to significantly improve skin conditions and quality of life for psoriasis patients. They are a valuable first-line treatment, as dry skin is common and adds to the irritability of the diseased skin. Skin hydration provides transient relief from irritation. Subsequently, an improved barrier function and stratum comeum hydration makes the epidermis more resistant to external stressors and reduces the induction of Koebner phenomena (excoriation, maceration and infectious foci (Streptococcus pyogenes)).
Experimental DesignSubjects48 to 64 patients suffering from moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris participate in this study. The age range is 18±70 years and the population includes men and women. They are evaluated for the severity of their disease on the morning following their arrival at the test site by a dermatologist and are followed up by the same dermatologist during their 2 week test period. The patients are instructed not to apply ointment or oil prior to the examination.
Clinical MeasurementsI. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score: This index is based on the quantitative assessment of three typical signs of psoriatic lesions: erythema (redness), infiltration (thickness), and desquamation (scaling), on a scale of 0±4, combined with the skin surface area involved. The basis for the PASI score is the evaluation of four separate body areas: head, trunk, and upper and lower extremities. Scoring them separately for erythema, infiltration, and desquamation, after establishing the extent of skin surface involved, is time-consuming, and may take 10±15 min even for experienced personnel. The PASI score is calculated as follows:
PASI=0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah+0.3(Et+It+Dt)At+0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au+0.4(El+Il+DI)AI
where E=erythema; I=infiltration; D=desquamation;
A=area; h=head; t=trunk; u=upper extremities; and 1=lower extremities

TEWL and Conductance: Protocol is as described in Example 2.K. Cutaneous Resonance Running Time (CRTT) on psoriatic lesions by Revicometer RVM 600: A Courage-Khazaka Reviscometer RVM600 (CKelectromic GmbH, Koln, Germany) is used to meantre the CRRTs in psoriatic lesions on the extensor of forearm and live contralateral uninvolved sites served as control. The measurement area with this probe is 8 mm. And the acoustical Shockwave running distance is 2 mm with energy of 1.77 IJ. Measurements are begun in the 12 o'clock position, which is determined with the right forearms laid on the table as described previously2, 3. Measurements are then taken clockwise at every 1 h interval or at every 30+ C. These measurements provide the CRRTs in the directions of 0-6 o'clock, 1-7, 2-8, and so on. Readings in 1-7, 2-8, 3-9, 4-10, and 5-11 o'clock direction on the left forearm are compared with those in 5-11, 4-10, 3-9, 2-8, 1-7 o'clock direction, respectively, on the right forearm. All subjects rested at 20-24° C., at a relative humidity of 50-55% for 30 min before measurements are taken.L. Stratum Corneum (SC) Thickness: Protocol is as described above for AD.M. Immunohistochemical staining: Protocol is as described above for AD.N. Statistical analysis: Simple regression analyses are also used to identify significant associations of SC hydration, thickness, or TEWL to PASI, Data with P-values less than 0.05 are evaluated as significant. We interpret P-values less than 0.005 as highly significant. Wilcoxon rank sum test and simple regression analyses are performed to assess the association or correlation between different biological markers including IgE, LDH, EOS, and the PASI.
Expected ResultsImproved SCORAD and DLQI and decreased TEWL over both disease affected and unaffected normal looking skin are expecte. The decrease in TEWL is in parallel with SCORAD score. Both SC integrity measure by epidermal thickness and hydration are improved slowly but significantly during 2 week treatment period. The ultrastructure of the SC treated with AN 109-Product 1 and 2 shows improved SC integrity and barrier function and subsequently reduces inflammation by “barrier repair” achieved with application of AN 109-1 and 2.

IV. Ichthyosis VulgarisBackgroundThe most common monogenic disorder of keratinisation, Ichthyosis Vulgaris, is associated with AD and related atopic manifestations in up to 50%1. X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) is a relatively common, recessive condition caused by mutations in the steroid sulfalase (STS) gene. Common loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) cause ichthyosis vulgaris and predispose individuals to atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis.
Experimental DesignSubjects48 to 64 patients with Ichthyosis Vulgaris participate in this study. The age range is 6±70 years and the population includes men and women. Patients with ichthyosis Vulgaris diagnosed according to widely accepted criteria1 are recruited from our dermatology clinic. Ichthyosis Vulgaris severity is assessed by SCORAD. Patients are classified into mild, moderate and severe Ichthyosis Vulgaris.

EXAMPLE 5Viscosity MeasurementsThe viscosity of a fluid can be measured by many methods known to one of skill in the art. Specifically, “The theology handbook: for users of rotational and oscillatory rheometers By Thomas G. Mezger” or ASTM standards such as ASTM D3835-08, ASTM D2857-95, ASTM D2196-10, and ASTM D2983-09 instruct one of skill in the art on how to measure the viscosity of a fluid. Illustrative methods also include the following methods:
Method A5Overview
This protocol determines the viscosity (cP) on a Brookfield Viscometer. This protocol can be performed on a wide variety of formulations including but not limited to immediate effects treatment, and perfector.

6Background
The viscosity of formulation is critical to its performance and its aesthetics. Furthermore a change in viscosity with time or exposure to a stress condition is an important indicator of formulation instability. As such, it is important to be able to reproduribly and accurately evaluate formulation viscosity. The following protocol can be used to determine lite viscosity at single shear rate of a formulation whose viscosity is between 50 and 300 Pas.

Pre-Study Visit: Screening, 20 Minute VisitEach panelist was asked to fill out a questionnaire required them to provide personal information. The personal questions addressed medical history, and current medications (topical or oral) for treating the specific skin condition. The panelists were instructed to use the product on the designated areas continuously for two or three weeks and make two additional 30 minute visits to the test site. Prior to leaving the Pre-Stndy visit, the designated skin sites were photographed.
Study Protocol—14 Days, 2-30 Minute VisitsThe skin lesions were determined at the Pre-study visit and each of these designated skin lesion sites were treated with the formulations (Step 1 and Step 2). Two of the three panelists were instructed to apply the formulation daily, minimally once a day, and repeating the application if the film was removed for the entire two week study period. The third panelist was asked to continuously wear the formulation for the first week of the study, but then not use the formulation for the second week and then to resume treatment for the third week. Each panelist documented the progression of their skin condition via daily photos to track the progression and changes of their skin appearance.
At the 1 week and 2 week time points, the skin condition of each panelist was evaluated by the study coordinator. Each panelist reported any irritation or changes in skin appearance as a result of the use of the formulation to the study coordinator. At each of these visits, photographs were taken of the designated test skin sites.

Study ResultsAt baseline, the panelists each had moderate eczema skin with dry, red patches, peeling skin, and moderate itchy and burning sensation. The individualized results are described below.
PanelistSkin lesion/Treatment Site#1lower right palm of the left handbetween the 3rd and 4th, and 4th and5th finger on the right hand#2Area above the left eye2nd finger of the right hand#3Entire palm of the right hand
Panelist 1Baseline: Skin was raw, red, dry and itchy with patches of flaky and peeling skin. 1st week: use of formulation: The skin is looking visibly better within 24 hours. Specifically, the skin looked less dry and was not red. The itching went away completely. The formulation worked faster than expected; as it usually takes the 
hydrocortisone
 creams a few days to fake effect. For the palm area, panelist 1 applied the product 1-2 times per day. When panelist 1 returned for the evaluation by the study coordinator, she had the product on, and the skin was healed with no signs of redness, dryness, or peeling skin.2nd Week: withdrawal (no usage) of the formulation: The skin condition deteriorated: the dryness and the itching returned. The skin appeared red and had started to peel again.3rd Week: use of formtdalion: Panelist self-reported that the skin condition is improving again and the skin looks to be healing. The dryness was gone and only one small spot of redness remained. The panelist reported that the skin was no longer itchy either.
Panelist 2Baseline: Skin was red, dry and itchy. Treatment sites: around eyes and finger.1st Week: The panelist returned with ashy and dry skin, and her skin condition looked similar to baseline. However, the panelist reported that she did not wear the product continuously and applied it only once per day. Instead, if the film was removed, the formulation was not reapplied immediately, thus resulting in large gaps between treatment.2nd Week: The panelist returned wearing the film formed from the formulation. The panelist's skin looked visibly better and was of a smooth texture and without redness. The panelist reported when the formulation was used her skin was neither itchy nor irritated. The panelist was instructed to continue treatment for another week with minimal time lapse between treatment.
Panelist 3Baseline: Skin was red, raw looking, had dry white patches, and was itchy, with visible patches of peeling skin.1st st Week: The panelist returned with formulation applied to her skin. The film was peeling when she arrived for the appointment, but when the film residues were brushed off, the study coordinator confirmed that her skin was no longer peeling. She had applied the pjxxluct 2-3 times/day depending on her activities. Although she did not note any visible difference with the product usage, she reported that the itching has been reduced. Her skin looked less dry but still slightly red. There were no signs of irritation from formulation use. but the difference between one week of treatment and baseline was not significant.2nd Week: The panelist returned with formulation applied to her skin. She had applied live product 2-3 times/day depending on her activities. Her skin looked better with the redness gone and most of the dry, peeling patches of skin healed. Again, the panelist reported no itching.
ConclusionThe formulation reduced or resolved the symptoms of the eczema patients involved in the study. Some of the benefits demonstrated by this study include a quicker healing time as compared to the panelists' current treatment regime, a better skin aesthetic appearance, and reduced irritation. In conelusion, an occlusive film resulting from the application of the 2-step formulations provided the protective barrier to the diseased skin with the compromised barrier function, such as the skin of eczema patients.
