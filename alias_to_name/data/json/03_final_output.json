Kd values of [3H]-prazosin to α1A adrenoceptors were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites with high and low affinities, respectively (n = 3), and α1B adrenoceptors the Kd value was 0,34 nM (n = 3), in agreement with literature (SHIBATA and cols., Mol.

The Kd value was used to calculate Ki of LDT's using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where for prazosin (PZS) Kd values were 0.46 nM and 56.5 nM for sites of high and low affinity, respectively to α1A adrenoceptor, and it was used Kd = 0.34 nM for α1B-adrenoceptor.\n7.
