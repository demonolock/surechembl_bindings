Once taken up by an epithelial cell, a therapeutic protein either enters the destructive lysosomal trafficking pathway or is released back into the intestinal lumen. This inability to be readily transported across the intestinal epithelium continues to be a limiting factor in developing commercially viable oral formulations, particularly for polypeptide-based therapeutics. A common solution is to use parenteral administration such as intravenous or subcutaneous administration, but these administration routes can often create considerable side effects, lower the therapeutic efficacy, and reduce patient convenience that can negatively affect compliance. There is a need for improved compositions and methods for transporting therapeutics into or across an epithelium, e.g., a gut epithelium. </p>INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE </p> [0003] All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. </p>SUMMARY </p> [0004] In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a carrier-payload complex comprising a carrier capable of endocytosing into a polarized epithelial cell and accumulating in a region of the cell, wherein the payload is heterologous to the carrier.

The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. A better understanding of the features and advantages of the present disclosure will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description that sets forth illustrative aspects, in which the principles of the disclosure are utilized, and the accompanying drawings (also“Figure” and“FIG.” herein), of which: </p> [0071] FIG. 1 schematically shows a setup comprising an apical chamber above an epithelial cell monolayer and a basal chamber below such epithelial cell monolayer. For apical to basolateral permeability (e.g., transcytosis), test articles (e.g., carriers, delivery constructs, payloads, etc.) were applied to the apical (A) side and the amount of permeated (e.g., transcytosed) material was determined (e.g., using western blotting, chromatography, etc.) on the basolateral (B) side. </p> [0072] FIG. 2 shows that a delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 147, comprising a carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and an IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142), transported the IL-22 payload across intact, polarized, Caco-2 gut epithelial cell monolayers in a time-dependent manner (the amount of protein on the basolateral site was measured 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the delivery construct was applied to the apical membrane of the monolayer as described above in FIG. 1). The data further show that when the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) comprising the carrier of SEQ ID NO: 134 and the IL-22 payload of SEQ ID NO: 142 is applied to the Caco-2 epithelial cells, about 2-3 fold more IL-22 crossed the Caco-2 epithelial cell monolayer as compared to when an IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) not coupled to a carrier is applied to the Caco-2 epithelial cells. </p> [0073] FIG. 3 shows that a delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 147, comprising a carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and an IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142), resulted in the IL-22 payload being transported across intact and polarized SMI- 100 gut epithelial cell monolayers in a time- dependent manner (the amount of protein in the basolateral chamber was measure at 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the delivery construct was applied to the apical membrane of the monolayer). The data further shows that when the delivery construct including the carrier of SEQ ID NO: 134 coupled to the IL-22 payload of SEQ ID NO: 142 is applied to the SMI-100 epithelial cells, \\n\\n about 2-3 fold more IL-22 crossed the SMI- 100 epithelial cell monolayer as compared to when an IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) not coupled to a carrier is applied to the SMI-100 epithelial cells. </p>[0074] FIG. 4 demonstrates that a delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 147 results in IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 142) being transported in significant amounts across an intact and polarized gut epithelium in vivo. Apical site of the gut epithelium is highlighted by white arrow #1. The lamina propria is abbreviated as“l.p.” The outer basal membrane of the polarized epithelium is highlighted by white arrows #2. IL-22 localization is indicated by white arrows and green fluorescence (e.g., white arrows #3), blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p> [0075] FIG. 5 shows that a first delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147), and a second delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 148) transported an IL-22 payload across Caco-2 monolayers (“after transport” refers to protein located in the basolateral compartment after transport across Caco-2 monolayers). The western blot data further shows that the delivery constructs were intact after transport, e.g., as shown by the absence of lower molecular weight degradation products. Transport of the IL-22 payload with delivery constructs SEQ ID NO: 147 and SEQ ID NO: 148 are shown relative to transport of an IL-22 control protein (SEQ ID NO: 143) in the absence of a carrier. The control protein IL-22 consisted of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 143. </p> [0076] FIG. 6 shows the amount of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) and an IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) detected in the basolateral compartment of Caco-2 epithelial cell monolayers following transcytosis. Protein amounts were normalized. The data show that transport of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) including a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) across polarized epithelial cells was dependent on glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75, e.g., GRP75B). Caco-2 cells with knockdown of GRP75 (indicated as Caco-2<sup>GRP75</sup> ) showed significantly reduced transport of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) as compared to cells expressing GRP75 (indicated as Caco-2). Dependence of transport on GRP75 is indicated by the reduced amount of delivery construct that was detected in the basolateral compartments in GRP75 knockdown cells as compared to cells expressing GRP75. The transport of IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) alone was not affected by GRP75 knockdown. </p> [0077] FIG. 7 shows that transport of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) across polarized epithelial cells was dependent on basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (HSPG). Caco-2 cells with knockdown of this protein (indicated as Caco-2<sup>HSPG</sup> ) showed significantly reduced transport of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) compared to cells expressing HSPG (indicated as Caco-2). Dependence of transport on HSPG is indicated by the reduced amount of delivery construct that was detected in the basolateral \\n\\n compartments in HSPG knockdown cells as compared to cells expressing HSPG. Transport of IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) alone (i.e., not coupled to a carrier) was not dependent on HSPG. </p>[0078] FIG. 8 depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 154) in apical compartments (highlighted with white arrow #2) within epithelial cells 15 min after intra-luminal injection using a rat intra-luminal injection model (white arrow #1 highlights the apical surface, white arrow #3 highlights the basal membrane, and white arrow #4 highlights the lamina propria). The data demonstrate that a carrier derived from an example of Cholix<sup>41 187</sup> (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 137) was capable of transporting a payload to apical </p>compartments of epithelial cells, but not across epithelial cells. Red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p> [0079] FIG. 9 depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 156) in apical compartments (highlighted with white arrow #2) of epithelial cells 15 min after intra-luminal injection using a rat intra-luminal injection model (white arrow #1 highlights the apical surface, white arrow #3 highlights the basal membrane, and white arrow #4 highlights the lamina propria). The data demonstrate that a carrier derived from an example of Cholix<sup>40 205</sup> (SEQ ID NO: 138) was capable of transporting a payload (e.g., hGH) to apical compartments of epithelial cells, but not across epithelial cells into the lamina propria. These data further suggest that residues 1-39 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can play a role in transcytosis but may not be required for endocytosis of a Cholix carrier. Red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p> [0080] FIG. 10A depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) in apical compartments inside epithelial cells 5 min after intra-luminal injection of the delivery construct to rat jejunum. In FIGs. 10A-10C, red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining; white arrow #1 highlights the apical compartments, and white arrow #2 highlights supranuclear compartments. </p> [0081] FIG. 10B depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) 10 min after intra-luminal injection. The data demonstrate that the carrier transported the hGH payload from apical compartments to supranuclear and basal compartments over time. </p> [0082] FIG. 10C depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) 15 min after intra-luminal injection. The data demonstrate that the carrier \\n\\n transported the payload from apical compartments to supranuclear and basal compartments over time. </p> [0083] FIGs. 11A-11B depict apical -to-basal transport of human growth hormone (hGH, SEQ ID NO: 190) alone compared to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) coupled to carriers. The carrier lengths are indicated by the C-terminal truncation relative to reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (e.g., “134” indicates a carrier having the residues 1-134 of SEQ ID NO: 1). All carriers further included an N-terminal methionine). Western blotting for hGH qualitatively assessed the capacity of these proteins to undergo apical-to-basal transport across polarized monolayers of primary human small intestinal epithelial cells in vitro after 2 h. The amounts of apically-applied materials were equivalent on a molar basis for hGH content, and basal collections were concentrated ~l0-fold prior to analysis. </p> [0084] FIG. 11A shows a comparison of the apical-to-basal transport of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) alone relative to that measured for the delivery constructs with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 151 - SEQ ID NO: 154 and SEQ ID NO: 159 with truncations at positions 134, 151, 187, 41-187, and 266, respectively. The data demonstrates that Cholix carriers with C- terminal truncations at positions 134, 151, 187 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or an N-terminal truncation at 41 and a C-terminal truncation at 187 of SEQ ID NO: 1, showed significantly lower apical-to- basal transport of conjoined hGH as compared to the construct with a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 159) with a C-terminal truncation at 266. </p> [0085] FIG. 11B shows that the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NO: 155 and SEQ ID NO: 157 - SEQ ID NO: 159 and that include Cholix carriers with C-terminal truncations at positions 206 (SEQ ID NO: 131), 245 (SEQ ID NO: 132), 251 (SEQ ID NO: 133), and 266 (SEQ ID NO: 134), respectively, compared to SEQ ID NO: 1 demonstrated efficient apical-to-basal transport of conjoined hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146). While carriers with Cholix C-terminal truncations at positions 245 and 251 demonstrated apical-to-basal transport of conjoined hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) comparable to that of the carrier with the C-terminal truncation at position 266, the carrier with a Cholix C-terminal truncation at position 206 showed a significant enhancement of apical- to-basal transport of hGH compared to the carriers with C-terminal truncations at positions 245, 251, and 266. </p> [0086] FIGs. 12A-12F show the extent of apical to basal transport across polarized gut epithelial cells in rat jejunum of six delivery constructs, each including a different Cholix carrier. Localization of the Cholix carrier (red fluorescence) and hGH (green fluorescence) is </p>demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal anti-Cholix and monoclonal anti-hGH antibodies, respectively. White arrows indicate the apical membrane,“1-p” refers to \\n\\n lamina propria ,“GC” refers to goblet cells, and open arrows indicates delivery construct present in the lamina propria. </p> [0087] FIG. 12A shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 151) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 140) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146). FIG. 12 A shows that the carrier did not enable the delivery construct to enter epithelial cells, suggesting that a functional sequence fragment having amino acid residues 135-151 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can play a role in endocytosis into polarized epithelial cells (in contrast, FIG. 12B demonstrates that the carrier with SEQ ID NO: 139 enabled cellular entry of the respective delivery construct via endocytosis). </p> [0088] FIG. 12B shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 152) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 139) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12B shows that this construct did enter epithelial cells (as opposed to the construct with SEQ ID NO: 151 described in FIG. 12A) but mainly remained in apical and, to some extent, in basal vesicular pools but did not enter the lamina propria , thereby enabling delivery of payload to apical and basal compartments of an epithelial cell. </p> [0089] FIG. 12C shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 136) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12C shows that this construct entered epithelial cells, reached apical and basal compartments and also reached a supra-nuclear region of the cell, yet still remained inside the epithelial cell, suggesting that the sequence fragment consisting of amino acid residues 152-187 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can allow access and delivery to supranuclear regions, as well as allow localization in basal compartments. </p> [0090] FIG. 12D shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 154) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 137) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12D shows that this construct entered epithelial cells but remained in apical compartments and did not appear to reach basal or supra-nuclear compartments. </p> [0091] FIG. 12E shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 155) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 131) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12E shows that this construct completed the transcytosis process as indicated by delivery constructs reaching the lamina propria (see open arrow), suggesting that the sequence fragment consisting of amino acid residues 188-206 of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 can enable \\n\\n the carrier (and constructs comprising such carrier) to engage with basal recycling processes that allow release of the carrier or respective construct from the epithelial cell into a basolateral compartment (e.g., lamina propria). </p> [0092] FIG. 12F shows the transport across rat jejunum epithelial monolayers in vivo 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by </p>immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12F shows that this construct completed the transcytosis process as indicated by delivery constructs reaching the lamina propria (see open arrow). </p> [0093] FIG. 13A, FIG. 13B, and FIG. 13C show that the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NO: 154, SEQ ID NO: 152, and SEQ ID NO: 153, respectively, co-localized with Rabl la on the apical side of the epithelial cells. The data also show that the constructs with SEQ ID NO: 152 and SEQ ID NO: 154 did not significantly localize at the basal side but remained mainly at the apical side. The construct with SEQ ID NO: 153 did localize at both the apical and basal side, however only co-localized with Rabl la at the apical side and not at the basal side (sub-images 3a and 3b of FIG. 13C). Together, these results suggest that carriers that are not capable of transcytosis can enter apical recycling systems of the epithelial cell. Measurements were carried out 15 min after intraluminal injection. Green fluorescence shows localization of hGH, red fluorescence shows localization of Rabl la (or Rabl 1), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining (experimental description includes FIG. 13D). </p> [0094] FIG. 13D shows that the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 159 co-localized with Rabl la on the basal side but not significantly on the apical side of the polarized epithelial cell. This suggests that carriers capable of transcytosis can utilize the basal recycling system for their release from the epithelial cell into the lamina propria (see sub-images 4a and 4b of FIG. 13D). </p>[0095] FIGs. 14A-14C show knockout effects of K8, HSPG (perlecan), and GRP75, respectively, on the transcytosis function of a delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 150 that includes a Cholix derived carrier with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 134 coupled to hGH via a spacer which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 177, as compared to hGH alone (SEQ ID NO: 190). Stable cell lines of Caco-2 cells lacking the expression of specific candidate proteins K8 (Caco-2<sup>K8</sup> ), HSPG (Caco-2<sup>HSPG</sup> ), and GRP75 (Caco-2<sup>GRP75</sup> ) were used as monolayers in vitro to verify their involvement in carrier (e.g., Cholix carriers) transcytosis via active and selective endogenous transport mechanisms. </p> [0096] FIG. 14A shows that K8 knockout did not significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). </p> [0097] FIG. 14B shows that HSPG (perlecan) knockout did significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). \\n\\n [0098] FIG. 14C shows that GRP75 knockout did significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). </p> [0099] FIG. 15A shows Biacore™ binding interactions used to examine the pH-dependency of Cholix carrier-GRP75 interactions. To that end, biotin was coupled to the C-terminus of full- length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and subsequently attached to a surface (e.g., chip surface, plastic 96-well plate, etc.) using the biotin-streptavidin </p>bioconjugation and incubated with purified GRP75 protein in buffer solutions at pH 5.5, 6.5, and</p>7.5, respectively. Highest binding affinity was for this interaction was measured at pH 6.5. </p> [0100] FIG. 15B shows the pH-dependence of the interaction of a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 189, full-length Cholix sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with a deletion of the glutamic acid residue at position 581) with the apical receptor (e.g., TMEM132 such as TMEM132A), the lysosome avoidance receptors (e.g., GRP75), traffic receptor (e.g., ERGIC-53), and basal receptor (e.g., perlecan). This pH dependency of receptor interaction as determined in plasmon resonance assays indicates that a Cholix-derived carrier can interact with certain receptors sequentially dependent on its location. For example, these data show that a Cholix-derived carrier has a significantly higher affinity to endocytosis and early trafficking receptors such as apical entry receptor and lysosome avoidance receptor at pH 7.5. Once the pH drops to about</p>5.5, the affinity of the Cholix carrier for these early trafficking receptors decreases, while its affinity for the apical -basal trafficking receptor ERGIC-53 and the basal release protein perlecan significantly increases at that pH, allowing the Cholix carrier to“be handed off’ to trafficking and basal release receptors during the vesicular transcytosis process. </p> [0101] FIG. 16 shows significant Biacore™ binding interactions of the full-length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 with perlecan and GRP75. </p> [0102] FIG. 17 shows significant Biacore™ binding interactions of the full-length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 with GRP75, perlecan, and TMEM132A. </p>[0103] FIGs. 18A-18D show the fate of human growth hormone (hGH, SEQ ID NO: 190) that was administered by intraluminal injection (ILI, luminal surface is indicated as a white arrow in FIG. 18A-FIG. 18F) into the rat jejunum in vivo was evaluated first as a negative control expecting transport to lysosomes after cellular uptake. </p> [0104] FIG. 18A shows that localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) 15 minutes post injection (ILI) was limited to a small population of vesicles in the apical region of epithelial cells as demonstrated by green immunofluorescence detection. </p> [0105] FIG. 18B, FIG. 18C, and FIG. 18D show that 15 min post ILI, hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) was co-localized with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, red </p>fluorescence) (FIG. 18B) and Ras-related protein (Rab7, purple fluorescence) (FIG. 18C) with \\n\\n about the same frequency and characteristics of resident LAMPl<sup>+</sup>, Rab7<sup>+</sup> lysosomes (FIG. 18D), indicating that hGH was directed to the lysosomal destructive (e.g., recycling) pathway shortly after uptake into the epithelial cells. </p> [0106] FIG. 18E and FIG. 18F show that a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) that includes a Cholix derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) via a spacer (SEQ ID NO: 175), was directed away from the lysosomal pathway and thus did not show co-localization with either LAMP 1 (FIG. 18E) or Rab7 (FIG. 18F), thereby enabling </p>transcytosis of functional payload across polarized epithelial cells into the lamina propria. </p> [0107] FIG. 19A shows that coating protein I (COPI, red fluorescence) distribution was restricted to the luminal apical membrane and apical vesicular compartment of epithelial cells prior to luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) that includes a Cholix derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) via a spacer (SEQ ID NO: 175). In comparison, following apical intraluminal injection (ILI, luminal surface is indicated as a white arrow in FIG. 19A-FIG. 19D) of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159), FIG. 19B shows that COPI redistributed to a supra-nuclear location, indicating co-localization of the vesicles containing both the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 159 and COPI. Blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. Measurements in FIGs. 19A-19D were carried out 15 minutes post-ILI. </p> [0108] FIG. 19C shows that LMAN1 (green fluorescence) co-localized with COPI (red fluorescence) in the apical region (highlighted by white arrow) of polarized epithelial cells prior to injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159). </p> [0109] FIG. 19D shows that, following apical ILI (highlighted by white arrow) of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159), LMAN1 interacted and distributed with the delivery construct to the basal region of the epithelial cell, which is adjacent to the lamina propria (denoted as“1-p”). Thus, an LMAN1 redistribution mechanism appears to be used by Cholix carriers to move from the apical side of the epithelial cell to a basal compartment. </p> [0110] FIGs. 19E-19H show trafficking of a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) from apical (indicated by white arrow #1) to basal (indicated by white arrow #2) compartments in epithelial cells 5 (FIG. 19F), 10 (FIG. 19G), and 15 min (FIG. 19H) after luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to an hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) in rat jejunum. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, ERGIC receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, and localization of another marker of ERGIC that may play a role in apical to basal trafficking (also referred to herein as ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex) is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of \\n\\n Cholix carrier and ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, ERGIC receptor, and ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0111] FIG. 19E shows untreated polarized gut epithelial cells. </p> [0112] FIG. 19F shows localization and interaction of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) with ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex 5 minutes after luminal injection in apical compartment as indicated by pink fluorescence signal in apical compartments. </p> [0113] FIG. 19G shows trafficking of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) in association with ERGIG-53 to the basal membrane 10 minutes after luminal injection followed by basal release of the carrier (and construct) into the lamina propria (gold arrow). These data demonstrate that a Cholix-derived carrier can utilize specific interactions with ERGIC proteins (e.g., ERGIC-53) to“hijack” vesicular trafficking from apical to basal compartments of a polarized epithelial cell. </p> [0114] FIG. 19H shows increased amounts of Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) present in the lamina propria 15 minutes after luminal injection. </p> [0115] FIGs. 19I-19K show that a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) utilized basal protein secretion mechanisms to traffic through a polarized epithelial cell into the lamina propria. The fluorescence microscopy images were acquired 15 min after luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to an hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) in rat jejunum, and show that basal vesicles (highlighted by white circles and numbers“1-3” in different epithelial cells) can contain Cholix carrier and ERGIC-53 receptor, Cholix carrier and basal secretion protein, or all three of Cholix carrier, ERGIC receptor, and basal secretion protein. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence (using an anti -Cholix carrier antibody), ERGIC-53 receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, and localization of basal secretion protein is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC-53 receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and the basal secretion protein perlecan is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, ERGIC-53 receptor, and perlecan is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0116] FIG. 191 shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and ERGIC-53 receptor as indicated by yellow fluorescence. </p> [0117] FIG. 19 J shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and perlecan as indicated by pink fluorescence. \\n\\n [0118] FIG. 19K shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134), ERGIC-53 receptor, and perlecan as indicated by white spots (e.g., overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). </p> [0119] FIG. 20A shows the distribution of another endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi- intermediate compartment (ERGIC) element, SEC22b, in the absence of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159). In untreated (i.e., no injection of a delivery construct) tissues, SEC22b and LMAN1 extensively co-localized in the apical compartment while LMAN1 alone was separately observed close to the apical plasma membrane. In FIGs. 20A-20D, red fluorescence shows localization of LMAN1, purple fluorescence shows localization of SEC22b, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH, white arrow indicates the apical surface, and“G” indicates Goblet cells. </p> [0120] FIG. 20B shows that 5 minutes after ILI of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), LMAN1, SEC22b, and hGH co-localized in the apical compartment but not significantly in basal compartments of epithelial cells. </p> [0121] FIG. 20C shows that 10 min post ILI, the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) and LMAN1 were observed to co-localize in the basal compartment of epithelial cells without SEC22b, confirming that LMAN1 interacted and moved with the delivery construct inside the vesicle from the apical to the basal vesicular compartment of epithelial cells. </p> [0122] FIG. 20D shows that the extent of delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) and </p>LMAN1 co-localizing in the basal compartment 15 min post ILI had increased, with an increasing amount of hGH reaching the lamina propria over time. </p> [0123] FIG. 20E-FIG. 20H show the same tissue sections as described above and shown in FIG. 20A-FIG. 20D but showing only LMAN1 and SEC22b signals (no hGH signal). This demonstrates the profound redistribution of LMAN1 to the basal compartment without a redistribution of SEC22b in response to apical application of a delivery (SEQ ID NO: 159).</p>These data demonstrate that delivery constructs comprising a Cholix derived carrier can utilize endogenous Cholix trafficking pathways that allow rapid and efficient transport of payload across the gut epithelium by coupling such payload to the carrier. </p> [0124] FIGs. 21A-21E show an exemplary surface model of a Cholix derived carrier consisting of SEQ ID NO: 178 (includes amino acid residues 1-265 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and an N- terminal methionine) which was used to highlight selected regions of interest that can play a role in certain functionalities related to apical to basal transcytosis, as well as their relative position and proximity on the protein surface. Amino acid regions located within residues V<sup>1</sup> and E<sup>39</sup> are adjacent to surface exposed amino acids D<sup>150</sup>-K<sup>186</sup> and K<sup>186</sup>-L<sup>205</sup>. Specifically, L<sup>17</sup>-!<sup>25</sup> (region XI, \\n\\n SEQ ID NO: 160) and c<sup>170</sup>-ΐ<sup>176</sup> (region X2, SEQ ID NO: 161) coordinate to form a pocket surrounded by several negative charges. Similarly, K<sup>186</sup>-H<sup>202</sup> (region X3, SEQ ID NO: 162) coordinates with I<sup>31</sup>-E<sup>39</sup> (region X4, SEQ ID NO: 163) to form a continuous ridge structure. In addition, the surface model shows residues D<sup>135</sup>-N<sup>139</sup> (region X5, SEQ ID NO: 164), and the asparagine residues (e.g., potential glycosylation sites) highlighted in purple. </p> [0125] FIG. 21A shows the amino acid sequence of a Cholix polypeptide with SEQ ID NO: 178. </p> [0126] FIG. 21B shows the location of regions XI, X3 and X4. </p> [0127] FIG. 21C shows the location of regions XI and X2, as well as X3 and X4. </p> [0128] FIG. 21D shows the location of regions XI, X2, X4 and X5. </p> [0129] FIG. 21E shows the location of regions XI, X2, X3, X4 and X5. </p> [0130] FIGs. 22A-22L illustrate a trafficking pathway analysis for a derived delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). The delivery construct comprised a Cholix derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) coupled to an active, secreted form of IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) via a glycine-serine spacer (SEQ ID NO: 176). In FIGs. 22A-22L the white arrow #1 highlights the apical surface, white arrow #2 highlights the basal surface, and white arrow #3 highlights the lamina propria. </p>[0131] FIG. 22A shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the EEA1 antigen in cellular locations consistent with trafficking at both the apical and basal compartments of epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in early endosome compartments. Red fluorescence shows localization of the EEA1 antigen, and the green fluorescence shows localization of IL-10. </p> [0132] FIG. 22B show that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the Rab7 (top left) predominantly in the apical compartment of epithelial cells, but with only limited co-localization in cells within the lamina propria , suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in late endosome compartments (bottom left shows white light image, and bottom right shows merged staining with DAPI staining is shown in blue, red fluorescence showing localization of the EEA1 antigen, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10). </p> [0133] FIG. 22C shows that LAMP1 was identified in large, specific vesicles consistent with mature lysosomes that were devoid of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) (white arrows, red fluorescence showing localization of the EEA1 antigen, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10). The delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149), however, co-localized with the LAMP1 antigen in cellular locations other than lysosome-like structures, consistent with vesicle trafficking at both the apical and basal compartments of epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in late endosomal compartments. \\n\\n [0134] FIG. 22D shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct also strongly co-localized with clathrin-coated vesicles, particularly in areas adjacent to the nucleus, and with Rabl la predominantly in the basal compartment of epithelial cells as well as in selected cells within the lamina propria. DAPI staining is shown in blue, red fluorescence shows localization of IL-10 antigen, and green fluorescence shows localization of clathrin. </p> [0135] FIG. 22E shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum as demonstrated by calnexin (red fluorescence showing localization of calnexin, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10) in a pattern adjacent to the nucleus in epithelial cells and in a large fraction of cells within the lamina propria. Specifically, the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the LMAN1 antigen appeared to re-distribute in response to carrier endocytosis and transcytosis, as shown for 5 (FIG. 22F), 10 (FIG. 22G), and 15 minutes after injection (FIG. 22H). </p> [0136] FIG. 22F shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC-53) and the LMAN1 antigen (red fluorescence showing localization of ERGIC-53 and LMAN1, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining) appeared to re-distribute in response to carrier endocytosis and transcytosis, as shown for 5 minute after injection. </p> [0137] FIG. 22G shows the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct co-localized with LMAN1 antigen 10 minutes after injection. The data show significant localization of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) in the lamina propria. </p> [0138] FIG. 22H shows the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct co-localized with LMAN1 antigen 15 minutes after injection. The data show significant localization of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) in the lamina propria. </p> [0139] FIG. 221 shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) did not co-localize with the low levels of giantin present in epithelial cells (red fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, and green fluorescence showing localization giantin, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining). Some giantin co-localized with the construct in a subset of cells present in the lamina propria , suggesting that the Cholix derived carrier does not locate with the Golgi compartment. </p>[0140] FIG. 22J shows that the 58K antigen localized in epithelial cells at a site apical to the nucleus and the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) showed some co-localization (red fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, and green fluorescence showing localization 58K Golgi antigen, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining) with this protein in a manner that \\n\\n suggests a brief movement through this compartment. No 58K antigen was observed in cells within the lamina propria. </p> [0141] FIG. 22K shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149, top left, IL-10 localization) showed some level of co-localization with the TGN38 antigen (top right), which showed a cellular distribution that was restricted to the apical side of nuclei in epithelial cells and adjacent to the nucleus in a few cells within the lamina propria. Bottom left image shows a white light image and bottom right shows a merge (overlay) with IL-10 (red), TGN38 (green), and DAPI signal (blue fluorescence). </p> [0142] FIG. 22L shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) (IL-10 localization shown by green fluorescence, top right) strongly co-localized with Rabl la (top left, localization shown by red fluorescence) predominantly in the basal compartment of epithelial cells and in selected cells within the lamina propria. Bottom left image shows a white light image and bottom right shows a merge (overlay) with IL-10 (green), Rabl la (red), and DAPI signal (blue fluorescence). </p> [0143] FIGs. 23A-23C show microscopy images demonstrating transcytosis of an IL-10 across polarized gut epithelial cells in Wistar rats at various time points following luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) included a carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 coupled to an IL-10 payload having the amino acid set forth in SEQ ID NO: 145 via a spacer having an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 176. Green fluorescence indicates the presence of IL-10 (via staining with an anti-IL-lO antibody). Blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining, which labels DNA, and red fluorescence indicates the presence of CK-8 (cytokeratin-8) with which a Cholix-derived carrier can co-localize (e.g., in a supranuclear region of an epithelial cell) during transcytosis. The white arrows #1 highlight the apical membrane of the epithelial cells, and the white arrows #2 highlight the basal membrane of the epithelial cells. </p>[0144] FIG. 23A demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 one minute after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data shows that transport of an IL-10 payload from the apical to the basal site and into the lamina propria occurred as early as 1 minute after application of the delivery construct. White arrow #3 indicates the presence of IL-10 in the lamina propria (see e.g., white arrows #3). </p>[0145] FIG. 23B demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 five minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data shows an increased amount of transported IL-10 payload that was present in the lamina propria (see e.g., white arrows #3) 5 minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct. \\n\\n [0146] FIG. 23C demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 ten minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data shows an even higher amount of transported IL-10 payload that was present in the lamina propria (see e.g., white arrows #3) 10 minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct. </p> [0147] FIGs. 23D-23F show apical endocytosis and early trafficking of the Cholix carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 in epithelial cells 1 min after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) comprising the Cholix carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 coupled to an IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) in rat jejunum. The data shows that Cholix-derived carriers avoid the lysosomal destruction pathway by interacting with lysosome avoidance receptors. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, apical entry receptor TMEM132 localization is shown by red fluorescence; and localization of lysosome avoidance receptors is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and the apical entry receptor TMEM132 is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, apical entry receptor TMEM132, and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0148] FIG. 23D shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) at the apical membrane (indicated by white arrow #1) of a polarized epithelial cell. Basal membrane is indicated by white arrow #2 and the lamina propria is indicated by white arrow #3. </p> [0149] FIG. 23E shows interaction of Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) with apical entry receptor TMEM132 as indicated by yellow fluorescence at and around the apical membrane. </p>[0150] FIG. 23F shows that Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135), apical entry receptor TMEM132, and lysosome avoidance receptor are in close proximity at the apical membrane as shown by white spots (e.g., overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence) indicated by the white arrow. It is assumed that the lysosome avoidance receptor (GRP75) can approach a Cholix carrier-apical entry receptor complex, followed by dissociation of the Cholix carrier with the apical entry receptor TMEM132 and association of the Cholix carrier with the lysosome avoidance receptor GRP75 due to changes in the pH environment and the pH-dependency of these Cholix carrier-receptor interaction as shown, e.g., in FIG. 15B. </p> [0151] FIGs. 23G-23H show trafficking of a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) from apical to supranuclear compartments in epithelial cells 5 and 15 min after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) coupled to an IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) in rat jejunum. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, ERGIC receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, apical entry \\n\\n receptor (e.g., TMEM132) localization is shown by orange fluorescence; and localization of lysosome avoidance receptors is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, apical entry receptor, and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p>[0152] FIG. 23G shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) in a polarized gut epithelial cell 5 minutes after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). The data shows that, following apical receptor-mediated endocytosis, the Cholix carrier forms complexes with a lysosome avoidance receptor and apical entry receptor close to the apical membrane (indicated by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence) and highlighted by white arrow) and also starts interacting with ERGIC receptor as demonstrated by yellow fluorescence (and the yellow arrow) slightly closer to supranuclear regions within the cell. </p> [0153] FIG. 23H shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) in a polarized gut epithelial cell 15 minutes after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). The data shows that the carrier moved from apical to supranuclear compartments while associated with ERGIC (see yellow arrow), wherein the yellow fluorescence intensity is increased compared to 5 minutes post-injection, indicating increased Cholix carrier movement from apical to supranuclear regions over time. The data further shows localization of Cholix carrier at the basal membrane and in the lamina propria (gold arrows). </p> [0154] FIG. 24 shows a diagram of intracellular compartment elements (e.g., cellular regions, compartments, and receptors such as transport receptor interaction partners (or TRIPs) of carriers) involved in the apical to basal transcytosis of carriers described herein. The transcytosis process is schematically described over a 15-minute time course. For example, Cholix derived carriers capable of transcytosis may not or may not significantly enter lysosomes or apical recycling pathway(s) following endocytosis (e.g., as depicted by recycling endosomes or“RE”). Redistribution of COPI and LMAN1, but not SEC22b, following apical application of a Cholix derived carrier, as well as access to basal compartment recycling pathway(s) are shown as pathway characteristics of Cholix derived carriers. Thus, the Cholix derived carriers described herein can utilize a series of intracellular vesicular compartments to traffic through polarized intestinal epithelial cells that can culminate in apical to basal transcytosis and allow such carriers to rapidly and efficiently (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) shuttle payload (e.g., therapeutic proteins) into the lamina propria. \\n\\n [0155] FIG. 25 shows that both a Cholix<sup>386</sup> derived carrier (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 135 or 180) and a Cholix<sup>415</sup> derived carrier (e.g., comprising residues 1-415 of SEQ ID NO: 1) transport an anti-TNFa agent (e.g., an anti-TNFa antibody or functional fragment thereof) across intestinal epithelial cells at 10 minutes and at 40 minutes. Moreover, a Cholix<sup>386</sup>-anti-TNFa construct transports at about 12c the rate of anti-TNF-a alone and a Cholix<sup>415</sup>-anti-TNFa transports at ~7x the rate of anti-TNF-a alone. </p> [0156] FIG. 26 shows the purity of SEQ ID NO: l92-Exenatide (SEQ ID NO: 192 crosslinked to Exenatide (SEQ ID NO: 195)) run on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. </p>[0157] FIG. 27 shows in vivo trancytosis of Exenatide crosslinked to carriers SEQ ID NO: 191 or SEQ ID NO: 192 across the jejunum of Sprague Dawley Rats. The amount (in pM) of Exenatide transported across intestinal tissues was measured at 10 minutes and 40 minutes post treatment. The data shows that both SEQ ID NO: l9l-Exenatide and SEQ ID NO: l92-Exenatide are capable of transport at a higher rate than Exenatide alone at 10 minutes and at 40 minutes. </p>[0158] FIG. 28A shows that the length of amino acid spacers with SEQ ID NOs: 175, 196, and 197 did not impact the ability of IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 142) when included in the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NOs: 147, 198, and 199 to induce IL-22 receptor dimerization. The induction of receptor dimerization of control recombinant human IL-22 (rhIL-22, SEQ ID NO: 143) is shown by the black curve. </p> [0159] FIG. 28B shows that coupling of the IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) to the N- or to the C-terminus of a carrier comprising amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1 via the spacer with SEQ ID NO: 196 did not significantly change the ability of the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NOs: 198, 200, and 201 to induce IL-22 receptor dimerization. The induction of receptor dimerization of control recombinant human IL-22 (rhIL-22) is shown by the black curve. </p> [0160] FIG. 28C shows that the length of amino acid spacers with SEQ ID NOs: 175, 196, and 197 did not impact the ability of IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 142) when included in the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NOs: 147, 198, and 199 to induce pSTAT3 activation. The pSTAT3 activation of control recombinant human IL-22 (rhIL-22, SEQ ID NO: 143) is shown by the black curve. </p> [0161] FIG. 28D shows that coupling of the IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) to the N- or to the C-terminus of a carrier comprising amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1 via the spacer with SEQ ID NO: 196 did not significantly change the ability of the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NOs: 198, 200, and 201 to induce pSTAT3 activation. The pSTAT3 activation of control recombinant human IL-22 (rhIL-22) is shown by the black curve. \\n\\n DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p> I. Introduction </p> [0162] Provided herein, in certain embodiments, are delivery constructs (e.g., carrier- payload complex) capable of transporting one or more heterologous payload molecules (e.g., one or more therapeutic payloads) into epithelial cells (e.g., polarized gut epithelial cells), e.g., by endocytosis, or across epithelial cells (e.g., polarized gut epithelial cells) by, e.g., by transcytosis. The delivery constructs can comprise a carrier that is coupled to the heterologous payload. The carrier can be capable of transporting the heterologous payload into or across epithelial cells using endogenous trafficking pathways. Utilization of endogenous trafficking pathways, as opposed to use of passive diffusion, can allow the carrier to shuttle the heterologous payload rapidly (e.g., at least 10 <sup>6</sup> cm/sec, 10 <sup>5</sup> cm/sec) and efficiently (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) into or across epithelial cells without impairing the barrier function of these cells or the biological activity of the heterologous payload. </p> II. Carriers </p> [0163] The carrier portion of a delivery construct provided herein can be any molecule (e.g., small molecule, polypeptide, nucleic acid, etc.) capable of increasing the rate and/or amount of a heterologous payload (e.g., a therapeutic payload) delivered into and/or across an epithelium. </p>[0164] A carrier herein can have numerous attributes. In some embodiments, a carrier herein can have a reduced (e.g., at least 50% reduced) or ablated ADP ribosylation activity (e.g., ribosylation of elongation factor 2) relative to a naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide such as SEQ ID NO: 3. </p> [0165] In some embodiments, a carrier herein utilizes an endogenous trafficking pathway to transport a heterologous payload coupled thereto across a polarized epithelial cell. Such carrier can be referred to herein as a transcytosing carrier. In some instances, a carrier herein can utilize an endogenous trafficking pathway to transport a heterologous payload coupled thereto into a polarized epithelial cell. Such carrier can be referred to herein as an endocytosing carrier. </p> Within endocytosing carriers, there can be carriers that deliver a payload coupled thereto into specific regions within the polarized epithelial cells such as an apical compartment, a </p>supranuclear compartment, or a basal compartment. </p> [0166] Any of the carriers herein can transport molecules coupled thereto by interacting and/or co-localizing with one or more endogenous proteins of such epithelium. The one or more endogenous proteins can be receptors or enzymes capable of moving a carrier into or across the epithelial cell. Interacting and/or co-localizing with the one or more endogenous proteins of the epithelial cell can provide a carrier with one or more functions, including endocytosis into the epithelial cell, avoidance of a lysosomal destruction pathway, trafficking from an apical \\n\\n compartment to a basal compartment, and/or exocytosis from the basal membrane of the epithelial cell into a submucosal compartment such as the lamina propria. </p> [0167] An interaction of such carrier with an endogenous protein can be a selective interaction. Such selective interaction can be a pH-dependent interaction. In instances where a carrier interacts with two or more endogenous proteins, such interactions can be sequential interactions where a first interacting protein hands the carrier off to a second interacting protein. Such sequential interactions can occur at a different pH (e.g., pH 5.5, 7.0, 7.5, etc.). An interaction between a carrier and an endogenous protein can be a covalent or non-covalent interaction. Non-covalent interactions include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, ionic bonds, p-p-interactions, etc. </p> [0168] In some instances, one of the endogenous proteins that a carrier can interact with can be an apical entry receptor. Such apical entry receptor can be a transmembrane protein 132 (TMEM132). Interaction of a carrier with such apical entry receptor can enable the carrier to enter the epithelial cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. </p> [0169] A carrier can also interact with a lysosome avoidance receptor. Such interaction with a lysosome avoidance receptor can occur inside the epithelial cell and subsequent to endocytosis. A lysosome avoidance receptor can be a glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75, e.g., GRP75B). Interaction of a carrier with such lysosome avoidance receptor can enable the carrier to avoid or circumvent lysosomal degradation. Such ability can allow a carrier to significantly reduce the amount of payload coupled to the carrier reaching a lysosome of a cell, a fate that most therapeutic proteins face once taken up by the gut epithelium. </p> [0170] Furthermore, a carrier can interact with an apical to basal trafficking protein. Such interaction can occur inside the epithelial cell and subsequent to endocytosis. Such apical to basal trafficking protein can be an endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) protein, such as ERGIC-53. Interaction of a carrier with an ERGIC protein can enable the carrier to move from an apical compartment to a supranuclear compartment or a basal compartment. </p> [0171] A transcytosing carrier can also interact with a basal release protein capable of promoting exocytosis of a carrier from a basal site of an epithelial cell. Such interaction can occur at the basal site of an epithelial cell and subsequent to moving from an apical compartment to a basal compartment. Such basal release protein can be perlecan (also referred to herein as basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein or HSPG). Interaction of a carrier with perlecan can enable the carrier to access a basal recycling system that allows release of the carrier from the basal compartment into a submucosal compartment such as the lamina propria. \\n\\n [0172] Thus, a transcytosing carrier herein can be a molecule that is capable of interacting with the endogenous proteins TMEM132 (e.g., TMEM132A), GRP75 (e.g., GRP75B), ERGIC (e.g., ERGIC-53), and perlecan (HSPG), enabling such carrier to transport a payload molecule coupled thereto across a polarized epithelium, e.g., a polarized gut epithelium. </p> [0173] An endocytosing carrier herein can be a molecule that is capable of interacting with the endogenous protein TMEM132, allowing apical entry of such carrier. An endocytosing carrier can remain associated with TMEM132 after endocytosis (e.g., compared to a </p>transcytosing carrier that can dissociate from TMEM132 after endocytosis to interact with, e.g., GRP75 or an ERGIC protein) and within apical regions and compartments of the cell (e.g., a polarized epithelial cell). In some cases, such endocytosing carrier can also interact with GRP75. Such interactions with TMEM132 and/or GRP75 can allow the carrier and a payload coupled thereto to avoid, or at least significantly reduce (e.g., less than about 50% compared to the payload molecule when it is not coupled to the carrier), lysosomal degradation. In some instances, an endocytosing carrier can remain in an apical compartment, and not show significant translocation to a basal compartment, for, e.g., at least about 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes after apical (e.g., luminal) application of the carrier compared to a transcytosing carrier that can show complete transcytosis of nearly all apically applied molecules, e.g., about 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes after apical (e.g., luminal) application. In some instances, at least about 50%, 75%, or 90% of carrier molecules remain in apical compartments 5 minutes after luminal application of the carrier. In some instances, at least about 50%, 75%, or 90% of carrier molecules remain in apical compartments 10 minutes after luminal application of the carrier. In some instances, at least about 50%, 75%, or 90% of carrier molecules remain in apical compartments 15 minutes after luminal application of the carrier. In some instances, at least about 50%, 75%, or 90% of carrier molecules remain in apical compartments 30 minutes after luminal application of the carrier. The percentage of carrier molecules that remain in the apical compartment of the epithelial cell can be determined by dividing the intensity of the fluorescence signal measured in a basal compartment of the cell by the intensity of the fluorescence signal measured in the apical compartment of the cell at the respective time point. </p> [0174] In other instances, an endocytosing carrier that is capable of transporting a payload to a supranuclear or basal compartment can interact with an ERGIC protein and/or another ER- Golgi trafficking protein complex that can allow the carrier to access such compartments inside an epithelial cell. </p> [0175] An endocytosing or transcytosing carrier can be a polypeptide. Such carrier can be derived from a polypeptide secreted by a bacterium, such as Vibrio cholerae (herein a Cholix derived polypeptide). A carrier can be a chimeric polypeptide derived from two or more different \\n\\n bacterial polypeptides. Such two or more different bacterial polypeptides can be derived from two or more different bacteria (e.g., Vibrio cholerae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , etc.), and/or derived from two or more different strains of a bacterium (e.g., two or more different strains of Vibrio cholerae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , etc.). </p> [0176] A carrier can be a naturally or non-naturally occurring polypeptide of a polypeptide secreted by such bacterium. </p> [0177] Non-naturally occurring polypeptides can include those having a C- and/or an N- terminal modification. </p> [0178] In one example, a polypeptide comprises one or more amino acid substitutions, and/or one or more amino acid deletions, and/or one or more amino acid additions relative to a sequence alignment with a naturally occurring polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3) or relative to a sequence alignment with a consensus sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 130). </p> [0179] Examples of substitutions contemplated herein include conservative substitutions of one or more amino acids. The following six groups each contain amino acids that are </p>conservative substitutions for one another: (1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), and Threonine (T); (2) Aspartic acid (D) and Glutamic acid (E); (3) Asparagine (N) and Glutamine (Q); (4) Arginine (R) and Lysine (K); (5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), and Valine (V); and (6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), and Tryptophan (W). </p> [0180] Additionally, or alternatively, mutations in a carrier contemplated herein include one or more of: V1L, L1V, D3E, E4A, E581A, etc., e.g., relative to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, or 130 (a number designates the amino acid position, a letter before the number designates the modified amino acid, and a letter after the number designate the substituted amino acid). In some cases, a carrier comprises a valine at position 1, a leucine at position 1, an aspartic acid at position 3, a glutamic acid at position 3, a glutamic acid at position 4, or an alanine at position 4 in the carrier (numbering relative to positions in SEQ ID NO: 1). </p>[0181] Examples of deletions include N-terminal truncations and C-terminal truncations. </p>[0182] As used herein, when a C-terminal truncation is referred to as occurring“at” an amino acid position, such amino acid is included in the truncated polypeptide. When an N- terminal truncation is referred to as occurring“at” an amino acid position, such amino acid is excluded from the truncated polypeptide. For example, in one instance, the carrier comprises SEQ ID NO: 1 with a C-terminal truncation at position 386. Such carrier ends at amino acid 386 (A) of SEQ ID NO: 1 at its C terminus. Additionally, the above carrier can be further truncated at position 20 at its N-terminus, thereby having an N-terminal amino acid of proline (P) (which is position 21 in the reference sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1). \\n\\n [0183] N-terminal truncations include those that remove up to 10, 20, 30, 39, or 40 amino acids at the N-terminal of a Cholix sequence herein (e.g., any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3, or 130). C-terminal truncations can be those described herein. Such N- and/or C-terminal truncations can result in different functions. Truncations can be described as relative to a wild-type sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3), relative to a non-naturally occurring sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), or relative to a consensus sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 130), wherein the residues are numbered from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, starting with position 1 an the N-terminus. For example, a carrier with a C-terminal truncation at position 266 relative to SEQID NO: 1 comprises amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> [0184] Examples of additions include: a signal peptide sequence, a purification peptide sequence, or other N-terminal modifications. A signal peptide sequence can comprise 1 to about 40 amino acids. In some cases, a carrier comprises an N-terminal methionine. The term“about,” as used herein in the context of a numerical value or range, generally refers to ±10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% of the numerical value or range recited or claimed, unless otherwise specified. </p> [0185] A carrier can have a substantial sequence identity (e.g., about, or greater than, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity, or 100% sequence identity) to a naturally occurring polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3), a non-naturally occurring polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 1-2), or to any of the functional fragments described herein (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 160-168). </p> [0186] The term“sequence identity” or a percent (%) of sequence identity, as used herein is the percentage of residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the residues in a selected sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining </p>percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. </p> [0187] A carrier (e.g., an endocytosing or a transcytosing carrier) herein can be derived from a polypeptide secreted from a Vibrio cholerae bacterium (e.g., those comprising a sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 3-125 or 127-129). Such carrier can be referred to as a Cholix derived polypeptide. A carrier derived from a Cholix polypeptide can include naturally and non- naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide sequences, as well as those sequences that have at least \\n\\n about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to a naturally (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3-78) or non-naturally (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1-2) occurring Cholix polypeptide described herein. A Cholix polypeptide derived carrier can also include endocytosing and/or transcytosing fragments (e.g., N- and/or C-terminal truncations of Cholix polypeptide) of naturally and non-naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide sequences, wherein such endocytosing and/or transcytosing fragments can have at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to any of such naturally or non-naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide sequences. </p> [0188] TABLE 1 provides exemplary full-length Cholix and Cholix derived sequences. </p> TABLE 1 - Exemplary Cholix Polypeptide

ablated ADP ribosylation activity (e.g., ribosylation of elongation factor 2) relative to a naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide such as one with a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. Such carriers can be referred to as non-toxic carriers. Examples of such Cholix derived polypeptides include any of the polypeptides with a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NO: 1-10 that can have a deletion at position 581 (e.g., an E581 deletion as, e.g., in SEQ ID NO: 189), a substitution at position 581 (e.g., a E581A substitution), or an alternative deletion or substitution that renders the carrier non-toxic. In some instances, a carrier has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:</p>130 with a mutation at position 581. In some instances, a carrier has an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3 with a mutation at position 581. </p> [0191] In some instances, a carrier comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of an amino acid sequence of any one of TABLE 1 or TABLE 2 with a C-terminal deletion, substitution and/or addition thereby resulting in a reduced or ablated ADP ribosylation activity. Such deletion, substitution, and/or addition maintains a transport functionality such as transcytosis or endocytosis. As such, some of the carriers herein transcytose, either alone or along with a heterologous payload, while some of the carriers herein endocytose, either alone, or along with a heterologous payload. </p> [0192] In some instances, a first carrier derived from a first Cholix polypeptide can have improved properties compared to a second carrier derived from a second Cholix polypeptide.</p>Such properties can include the ability of a carrier to transport a heterologous payload across a polarized epithelial cell (or cell layer), a stability of a carrier (e.g., an in vivo stability or an ex vivo stability such as shelf-life), the ability of a carrier to be functionally expressed in an expression system such as E. coli or CHO cells, the ability of a carrier to be purified, e.g., using chromatographical methods, and the ability to multimerize (e.g., dimerize) when, e.g., associated (e.g., coupled) with a heterologous payload. It can surprisingly be shown that a first carrier derived from a Cholix polypeptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 can have one or more of the following properties compared to a second carrier derived from a Cholix polypeptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 and/or 126: (i) an enhanced transcytosis function (e.g., an increased transport rate for transporting a payload across epithelial cells); (ii) improved functional expression (e.g., higher production yields) in E. coli and/or CHO cells; (iii) improved purification properties (e.g., higher purities and/or recovery yields); and (iv) an enhanced in vivo stability (e.g., an increased protease and/or pH stability, melting temperature). Such in vivo stability can be determined by incubating the carrier with, e.g., Caco-2 cells or by administering \\n\\n (e.g., injecting into a lumen) the carrier to a mammal (e.g., a rodent or a human). Enhanced transcytosis function, e.g., a speed or velocity of transportability can be determined, e.g., as described in EXAMPLE 1 by determining the amount of transported carrier and/or payload in a basolateral chamber at certain time points (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes after apical application of the carrier or delivery construct). In some cases, the stability of a carrier against a protease can be determined by incubating the carrier with the protease (e.g., trypsin) at certain molar ratios (e.g., 1 : 1) and at ambient temperature, and measuring the amount of intact carrier at various time points (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 30, or 45 minutes) using, e.g., size-exclusion </p>chromatography. The stability of the carrier at a certain pH can be determined by incubating the carrier with a buffer having the appropriate pH (e.g., pH 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, etc.) and measuring the amount of intact carrier at various time points (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 30 min.) using, e.g., size-exclusion chromatography. </p> [0193] A transcytosing carrier can transport a payload, coupled thereto, across an epithelial cell. Such transport can occur in vitro , e.g., using epithelial cell monolayers such as Caco-2 or SMI-100 cell monolayers. In other instances, such transport can occur in vivo , e.g., across a gut epithelium of a subject (e.g., a rodent or a human) into submucosal compartments such as the lamina propria. </p> [0194] The mechanism of action of a transcytosing carrier can involve one or more of: receptor-mediated endocytosis into a polarized epithelial cell through interaction with </p>TMEM132, LMAN1 and/or GPR75, avoidance of the lysosomal destruction pathway through interaction with GRP75, apical to basal transport through interaction with an ERGIC receptor (e.g., ERGIC-53), and release from the basal membrane into submucosal compartments such as the lamina propria through interaction with perlecan (HSPG). </p> [0195] A transcytosing carrier can be one that interacts with one or more of the following endogenous proteins: TMEM132A, GPR75, ERGIC protein, and perlecan (HSPG) as shown in EXAMPLES 10 and 12. Interaction of a transcytosing carrier with an apical entry receptor such as TMEM132A can enable apical entry of the carrier into a polarized epithelial cell. Interaction of a transcytosing carrier with a lysosome avoidance receptor such as GRP75 can enable the carrier and a payload coupled thereto to avoid lysosomal degradation, thereby allowing transport of unaltered and functionally intact carrier and payload. Interaction of a transcytosing carrier with an apical to basal transport protein such as an ERGIC protein (e.g., ERGIC-53) can allow the carrier, once endocytosed, to move to the basal site of the epithelial cell. Interaction of a transcytosing carrier with a basal release protein such as perlecan can enable the carrier to enter basal recycling systems and exocytosis of the carrier into basolateral compartments, such as submucosal compartments (e.g., lamina propria). \\n\\n [0196] Moreover, a transcytosing carrier can co-localize with any one or more of coating protein I (COP I) early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) for hijacking the endogenous apical to basal transport machinery, and with Ras-related protein 1 la (Rabl la) at the basal side of the epithelial cell for entering basal secretion systems as shown in EXAMPLE 10. </p> [0197] In some instances, a transcytosing carrier does not co-localize with Ras-related protein 7 (Rab7) and/or lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) during transport across such epithelial cell, enabling such carrier to avoid lysosomal degradation as shown in EXAMPLE 10 </p> [0198] Examples of transcytosing carriers include those having a C-terminal truncation of any of SEQ ID NOs 1-78 or 130, wherein the C-terminal truncation can occur at the C-terminus of the polypeptide at any amino acid position after the C-terminal residue at position 195 (e.g., truncation at any one of positions 195-634 of SEQ ID NOs: 1-2). Amino acid positions for truncation can be determined using sequence alignment to consensus sequence SEQ ID NO: 130 or any of reference sequences SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3. TABLE 3 below illustrates exemplary carriers by identifying various amino acid residue sequences of such carriers and C-terminal positions that SEQ ID NOs 1-78, or 130 can be truncated at. In some instances, transcytosing carriers include those having a C-terminal truncation of any of SEQ ID NOs 1-2 or 4-78. </p> TABLE 3 - Exemplary Transcytosing Carriers Identifying Amino Acid Residues of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-78 or 130 </p><img id=\"imgf000093_0001\" path=\"imgf000093_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901319/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000093_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000094_0001\" path=\"imgf000094_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901295/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000094_0001.tif\"/></p>[0199] Such transcytosing carriers can further be truncated at their N-terminus at an amino acid position up to N-terminal position 20 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 79 which is truncated at the N- terminal position 17 (starts with position 18)). </p> [0200] Also contemplated herein are transcytosing carriers such having at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity, to any of the carrier sequences shown in</p>TABLE 3 </p> [0201] In one instance the carrier comprises SEQ ID NO: 1 with a C-terminal truncation at position 386. In one instance the carrier comprises SEQ ID NO: 2 with a C-terminal truncation at position 386. In one instance the carrier comprises SEQ ID NO: 4-79 with a C-terminal truncation at position 386. In one instance the carrier comprises SEQ ID NO: 130 with a C- terminal truncation at position 386. In such instances, the sequence does not include SEQ ID NO: 3 with a C- terminal truncation at position 386. In such instances, the sequence does not include SEQ ID NO: 126. \\n\\n [0202] When a Cholix derived carrier has a C-terminal truncation at position 386, it can be referred to herein as Cholix<sup>386</sup>. The“386” designates the C-terminal truncation after the amino acid that most closely aligns with position 386 when the sequence is part of or aligned with SEQ ID NO: 130. A cholix<sup>386</sup> does not necessitate that the polypeptide has 386 amino acids in it. For example, a truncation of SEQ ID NO: 79 at position 386 results in a carrier that is shorter than 386 amino acid residues. Examples of Cholix<sup>386</sup> carrier molecules include any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-79 or 130 truncated at position 386 as it is aligned for the highest sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 130 or it is aligned with any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3 for highest sequence identity, e.g., ending with the amino acid residues“AQA.” </p> [0203] A Cholix<sup>386</sup> can also include polypeptides maintaining substantially the same function as SEQ ID NO: 180 but with one or more additions/deletion/substitutions, and having at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the Cholix<sup>386</sup> molecules described herein. </p> [0204] Another example of a transcytosing Cholix derived carrier is Cholix<sup>266</sup>. In one instance, a Cholix<sup>266</sup> consists of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 181. Other Cholix<sup>266</sup> fragments can include those of any of SEQ ID NO: 1-78 truncated at amino acid position 266 as it is aligned for the highest sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 130 or it is aligned with any of SEQ ID NOs 1-3 for highest sequence identity. Alternatively, a carrier can have any sequence of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) truncated at the C-terminus at position 266. </p> [0205] Another example of a transcytosing Cholix derived carrier is Cholix<sup>251</sup>. In one instance, a Cholix<sup>251</sup> consists of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 182. Other Cholix<sup>251</sup> fragments can include those of any of SEQ ID NO: 1-78 truncated at amino acid position 251 as it is aligned for the highest sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 130 or it is aligned with any of SEQ ID NOs 1-3 for highest sequence identity. Alternatively, a carrier can have any sequence of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) truncated at the C-terminus at position 251. </p> [0206] Another example of a transcytosing Cholix derived carrier is Cholix<sup>245</sup>. In one instance, a Cholix<sup>245</sup> consists of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 183. Other Cholix<sup>245</sup> fragments include those of any of SEQ ID NO: 1-79 truncated at amino acid position 245 as it is aligned for the highest sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 130 or it is aligned with any of SEQ ID NOs 1-3 for highest sequence identity. Alternatively, a carrier can have any sequence of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) truncated at the C-terminal at position 245. </p> [0207] Another example of a transcytosing Cholix derived carrier is Cholix<sup>206</sup>. In one instance, a Cholix<sup>206</sup> consists of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 184. Other Cholix<sup>206</sup> fragments include those of any of SEQ ID NO: 1-78 truncated at amino acid position 206 as it is aligned for the highest sequence identity with SEQ ID NO 130 or it is aligned with any of SEQ \\n\\n ID NOs 1-3 for highest sequence identity. Alternatively, a carrier can have any sequence of </p>FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) truncated at the C-terminal at position 206. </p> [0208] Other examples of carriers include those having a C-terminal truncation at any one of amino acid position 195-634 of the sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). Preferably, such truncation is at an amino acid position of any one of 195-347 of the sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). </p> [0209] At the N-terminus, a transcytosing carrier can have any of amino acids 1-20 of SEQ ID NOs: 1-78, or 130. In some embodiments, the N-terminus of the carrier has amino acid residues 1-20 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 (100% sequence identity at positions 1-20), or an amino acid sequence having at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to amino acid residues 1-20 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. In some embodiments, the first four amino acids at the N-terminus are VEEA (SEQ ID NO: 185). In some embodiments, such carrier does not comprise SEQ ID NO: 126. In some embodiments, the N-terminus of the carrier has the amino acid residues 1-20 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). Any of such carrier can optionally have an N-terminal modification as described herein. Such N-terminal modification can be an N-terminal methionine. Examples of such carriers are those comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 131- 135. </p> [0210] As such, a transcytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of an amino acid sequence having at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity, or have 100% sequence identity, to the amino acid residues from position 1 to any of the amino acid residues at any one of the positions 205-275 of the amino acid sequence set forth in </p>FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). </p> [0211] In such instances, a transcytosing carrier consists, consists essentially of, or comprises amino acid residues 1-275, 1-266, 1-265, 2-265, 3-265, 4-265, 5-265, 1-251, 1-250, 2- 250, 3-250, 4-250, 5-250, 1-245, 2-245, 3-245, 4-245, 5-245, 1-206, 1-205, 2-205, 3-205, 4-205, or 5-205 of the amino acid residues set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). In various instances, such carrier can consist or consist essentially of amino acid residues 1-275, 1-266, 1- 265, 2-265, 3-265, 4-265, 5-265, 1-251, 1-250, 2-250, 3-250, 4-250, 5-250, 1-245, 2-245, 3-245, 4-245, 5-245, 1-206, 1-205, 2-205, 3-205, 4-205, or 5-205 of the same amino acid residues set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-78. </p> [0212] Specifically, in some instances, such transcytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-275, 1-266, 1-265, 2-265, 3-265, 4-265, 5- 265, 1-251, 1-250, 2-250, 3-250, 4-250, 5-250, 1-245, 2-245, 3-245, 4-245, 5-245, 1-206, 1-205, 2-205, 3-205, 4-205, or 5-205 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. \\n\\n [0213] Alternatively, in some instances, such transcytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-275, 1-266, 1-265, 2-265, 3-265, 4-265, 5- 265, 1-251, 1-250, 2-250, 3-250, 4-250, 5-250, 1-245, 2-245, 3-245, 4-245, 5-245, 1-206, 1-205, 2-205, 3-205, 4-205, or 5-205 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. </p> [0214] A carrier can be further modified at its N-terminus. Such N-terminus modifications include functional groups that can enhance expression and/or stability of the polypeptide. Such terminal modifications can be illustrated by the following designation“FG-Carrier”, wherein FG is a functional group attached to the N-terminus of the carrier. Examples of functional groups contemplated herein include a methionine for bacterial expression and other signal sequences for expression in CHO cells or HEK-293 cells. Examples of transcytosing carriers with an N- terminal methionine include those having an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 131-135 (TABLE 4). It should be noted that functional groups can also be coupled to the C-terminus of a carrier. </p> TABLE 4 - Exemplary Transcytosing Cholix Derived Carriers </p><img id=\"imgf000097_0001\" path=\"imgf000097_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901271/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000097_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000098_0001\" path=\"imgf000098_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901286/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000098_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000099_0001\" path=\"imgf000099_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901314/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000099_0001.tif\"/></p>[0215] Using crystal structure information of a Cholix derived carrier having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 178, a handful of regions were identified that can play a role in endocytosis and transcytosis. Such regions are referred to herein as Xi, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, X<sub>4</sub>, X<sub>5</sub>. Xi spans amino acid residues 17 - 25, has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 160, and can play a role in apical to basal transport of a carrier, e.g., by allowing interaction of a carrier with an ERGIC protein (e.g., ERGIC-53). X<sub>2</sub> spans amino acid residues 170 - 176, has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 161, and can play a role in carrier access to supranuclear compartments and to move from the apical to the basal site of an epithelial cell, e.g., by allowing interaction of a carrier with an ERGIC protein. X<sub>3</sub> spans amino acid residues 186 - 202, has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 162, and can play a role in basal release of the carrier into basolateral compartments, e.g., by allowing interaction of a carrier with a basal release protein such as perlecan. X<sub>4</sub> spans amino acid residues 31 - 39, has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:</p>163, and can play a role in carrier movement from the apical site an epithelial cell to the basal \\n\\n site, e.g., by allowing interaction of a carrier with an ERGIC protein. X<sub>5</sub> spans amino acid residues 135 - 139, has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 164, and can play a role in apical entry of a carrier into an epithelial cell, e.g., by allowing interaction of a carrier with an apical entry receptor such as TMEM132. </p> [0216] Thus, in some embodiments, a transcytosing carrier includes the amino acid residues of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-78, or 130 at Xi, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, X<sub>4</sub>, and/or X<sub>5.</sub> For example, a carrier herein can have amino acids 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, or a sequence having at substantial sequence identity thereto; provided however that any one or more of Xi, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, X<sub>4</sub>, and X<sub>5</sub> are identical to those of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. In one embodiment, all of Xi, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, X<sub>4</sub>, X<sub>5</sub> are identical to those of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. The same can be said for all other carriers and Cholix- derived carriers described herein, such as those provided in TABLE 3 or TABLE 4. </p> [0217] In some embodiments, transcytosing carriers exclude those having a sequence of any one or more of the Cholix sequence polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1-78 or 130. In some instances, those polypeptides are excluded that have a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a truncated SEQ ID NO: 3 with a C-terminal truncation at residue 425-348, 291, 266, 265, 251, 250, 245, 244, 234, 206, 205, 187, 186, 151, 150, 134, 133 as well as the fragment consisting of residues 40-187 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, transcytosing carriers exclude those comprising, consisting essentially, or consisting of a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 126. </p> [0218] Surprisingly, it has also been identified that carriers shorter than the transcytosing carriers can transport a heterologous payload into a polarized epithelial cell without significant transport of such payload across the epithelial cell. Such carriers can be referred to herein as “endocytosing carriers”. Endocytosing carriers can end up in an intracellular vesicle or cytosol of the epithelial cell. </p> [0219] Examples of endocytosing carriers include those having amino acid residues from any one of the positions 1-40 to any one of the positions 145-194 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). In some embodiments, an endocytosing carrier has an amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-80 or 82-120, having a C-terminal truncation at any one of the amino acid positions of 145-194. </p> [0220] Moreover, any of the endocytosing carriers can further have an N-terminal truncation. Such N-terminal truncation can remove up to 40 amino acids from the N-terminus of the carrier. For example, contemplated herein are carriers having amino acids VLYY (SEQ ID NO: 186) or GVLYY (SEQ ID NO: 187) at the N-terminus which is representative of amino acid position 41-44 and 40-44 of SEQ ID NO: 130, respectively. In some instances, a carrier comprises a higher degree of sequence disparity at positions 1-40 as compared to amino acids 41 to a C terminus (e.g., a C-terminus at an amino acid residue selected from positions 145-194) of \\n\\n the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-80 or 82-120, or SEQ ID NO: 130. A carrier most preferably comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the amino acid residues from any one of the positions 1-20 to any one of the positions 150-187, or from any one of the amino acid residues at positions 21-41 to the amino acid residue at position 187 or 205 of the amino acid sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). TABLE 5 provides exemplary amino acid residues that an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of. </p> TABLE 5 - Exemplary Amino Acid Residues of Cholix Carriers of any one of SEQ </p> ID NOs: 1-78 or 130 </p><img id=\"imgf000101_0001\" path=\"imgf000101_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901356/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000101_0001.tif\"/></p>[0221] In some instances, such carrier has an N-terminal truncation at position 39 of </p>FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). In other instances, such carrier has an N-terminal truncation at position 40 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). When such carrier is also truncated at its C- terminus at any one of the amino acid residues at positions 145-206 (i.e., having the C-terminal residue of any one of residues 145-206) of the sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: \\n\\n 130), such carrier can be used for endocytosis of a payload into an epithelial cell and transporting such payload to apical compartment(s) of such epithelial cell (see, e.g., EXAMPLE 4). Any of these endocytosing carriers described herein can also comprise an N-terminal modification such as an N-terminal methionine. Examples of such carrier are those comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the amino acid residues 41-187 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (SEQ ID NO: 137), or of the amino acid residues 40-205 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (SEQ ID NO: 138). </p> [0222] In some embodiments, an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-150 of any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1- 78, or 130. In some embodiments, an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-151 of any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1- 78, or 130. In some embodiments, an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-186 of any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1- 78, or 130. In some embodiments, an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 1-187 of any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1- 78, or 130. In one instance, the carrier has amino acids 1-150, 1-151, 1-186, or 1-187 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another instance, the carrier has amino acids 1-150, 1-151, 1-186, 1-187 of SEQ ID NO: 2. </p> [0223] Any of the endocytosing carriers herein can have a functional group (such as a methionine) attached to their N-terminus. Examples of endocytosing carriers with an N-terminal methionine include those with sequences set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 136 or 139. </p> [0224] In other cases, such endocytosing carrier comprises the amino acid residues from position 40 or 41 to any one of the amino acid residues at positions 187-206 of the amino acid sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). </p> [0225] In such instances, an endocytosing carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 40-187 or 41-187 of any one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1-80, 82-120, or 130. In other instances, a carrier capable of transporting a heterologous payload into a polarized epithelial cell can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 40-205 or 41-205 of any one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1- 80, 82-120, or 130. </p> [0226] Such carrier can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the amino acid residues 40-187, 41-187, 40-205, or 41-205 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Exemplary amino acid sequences of such carriers include those that consist of, consist essentially of, or comprise an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 137 and 138. Such carriers can be capable of transporting a payload to an apical compartment of a polarized epithelial cell, but not to a basal compartment as those carriers lack amino acid residues 1-39 that can play a role in apical to basal transport. \\n\\n [0227] An endocytosing carrier can comprise the endocytosis fragment that consists of the amino acid residues from position 134 to position 151 of the amino acid sequence set forth in Formula I (SEQ ID NO: 130). In some cases, such functional fragment has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 165, or a high (e.g., &gt;90%) sequence identity thereto. Exemplary carriers include those that can consist of, consist essentially of, or comprise an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 136-139 (TABLE 6). Carriers that lack one or both functional fragments with SEQ ID NOs: 166-167 (TABLE 11) can transport heterologous payload to apical compartments of epithelial cells that can include locations in apical vesicles, in the apical cytosol of the cell, and/or in the apical recycling systems such as apical recycling endosomes. Such carrier can interact with an apical entry receptor such as TMEM132 (e.g., TMEM132A), but not or not significantly with basal trafficking proteins or perlecan (HSPG) and can co-localize with Rabl la in apical compartments of the epithelial cell following endocytosis. In some instances, such carrier can consist of, consist essentially of, or comprise an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 137-139 (TABLE 6). </p> TABLE 6 - Exemplary Endocytosing Cholix Derived Carriers </p><img id=\"imgf000103_0001\" path=\"imgf000103_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901290/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000103_0001.tif\"/></p> [0228] In other embodiments, an endocytosing carrier can comprise the functional fragments that consist of the amino acid residues from position 1 to position 40 and position 152 to position 187, respectively, of the amino acid sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). In some cases, such fragments have the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 166 and 167, respectively, or a high (e.g., &gt;90%) sequence identity to one or both of such functional fragments. Such carrier can interact with an apical to basal trafficking receptor, but \\n\\n not significantly with perlecan. Such trafficking receptor enables such carrier to transport a payload to a supranuclear and/or a basal compartment of a polarized epithelial cell. Such carrier can consist of, consist essentially of, or comprise amino acids 1-187 of SEQ ID NO: 130. An example of such carrier is one that has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 136. </p> [0229] In some instances, an endocytosing carrier is not a fragment of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. In some instances, such carrier is not a fragment of any one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 4-80, or 82-120. In such instances, a carrier does not comprise or consist of amino acid residues 1-151, 1-187, or 40-187 of SEQ ID NO: 3. </p> D. Functional Sequence Regions of Carriers </p> [0230] In any of the embodiments herein, one or more functional sequence region(s) within a carrier sequence can have a localized high (e.g., &gt;90%) sequence identity to the amino acid residues found in those regions in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) in order to maintain functionality across numerous polypeptides and embodiments. In some cases, the amino acid residues in those region(s) can be restricted to those found in naturally occurring Cholix polypeptides such as those having the sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-80 or 82- 120 </p> 1. Endocytosing Domain </p> [0231] In some instances, a carrier comprises a domain that allows the carrier to enter an epithelial cell (e.g., a polarized epithelial cell) on the apical site. In some instances, such domain allows the carrier to interact with an apical entry receptor. Such apical entry receptor can be TMEM132 or TMEM132A. Such TMEM132 interacting domain may have a consensus sequence of amino acid residues 135-151 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) or of amino acid residues of positions 135-151 of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-120. TMEM132A is a transmembrane protein that is responsible for apical entry of a carrier into an epithelial cell. In order to maintain carrier interaction with TMEM132A, in some embodiments, a carrier herein includes a SEQ ID NO: 165 which sets forth a consensus sequence for a TMEM132A interacting domain. </p>Alternatively, a carrier herein can include the amino acid residues 135-151 of any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 1-120, or 130 as its TMEM132 interacting domain. </p> [0232] Moreover, it is surprisingly assumed that subregions within the TMEM132 interacting domain may be particularly relevant for apical entry of the carrier. Thus, a carrier herein may interact with an apical entry receptor such as TMEM132 via an interacting region with an amino acid motif having amino acid residues 135-139 of SEQ ID NO: 130 (e.g., “DQQRN” of SEQ ID NO: 1; SEQ ID NO: 164). Thus, any of the carriers herein (including polypeptides thereof) may include such motif, or the entire TMEM132 interacting domain (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 165) in order to provide entry into the epithelial cells on the apical side. As such \\n\\n regions can have functions within the carrier, the amino acid sequences in such regions may be conserved, or has only up to 1, 2, or 3, amino acid residues that are substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions. </p> [0233] Any of the carriers herein may include a TMEM132 interacting domain or receptor interacting regions in order to enter the epithelial cell. For example, a carrier comprising amino acid residues 1-151 of SEQ ID NO: 1, which includes a TMEM132 interacting domain of SEQ ID NO: 165 can enter epithelial cells on the apical side. Similarly, a Cholix<sup>266</sup> carrier, such as a carrier comprising amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 181), includes the TMEM132 domain and can both enter the apical side of the epithelial cells via the TMEM132 domain and transport a heterologous payload across a polarized epithelial cell. Other exemplary carriers comprising a TMEM132 interacting domain are Cholix<sup>187</sup>, Cholix<sup>206</sup>, Cholix<sup>245</sup>, Cholix<sup>251</sup>, and Cholix<sup>386</sup> (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 136, and 180-184). In some instances, a carrier is one having amino acid residues 1-187, 1-206, 1-245, 1-251, 1-266, or 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> [0234] On the other hand, a carrier lacking a TMEM132 interacting domain, such as M- Cholix<sup>134</sup> having SEQ ID NO: 140 can remain in the intestinal lumen and does not, or does not significantly (e.g., less than 10% of carrier material that was applied to the apical surface), enter an epithelial cell (see, e.g., EXAMPLE 6). </p> 2. Supranuclear and Basal Compartment Targeting Domains </p>[0235] In some instances, a carrier comprises N-terminal amino acid residues 1-40 of the sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). Such carrier can be used to transport a heterologous payload from an apical to a supranuclear or basal compartment (and into submucosal compartments, if such carrier can also interact with a basal release protein such as perlecan) of an epithelial cell following endocytosis of the carrier into the cell. Examples of such carriers include those comprising amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 131-135 </p>(TABLE 4) </p> [0236] In some instances, a carrier comprises amino acid residues 17-25 and/or 31-39 of the sequence set forth in FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130). Such regions can be restricted to those amino acid residues found in a naturally occurring Cholix polypeptide or include up to 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions. The substitution(s) can be one or more conservative or non-conservative substitutions. The 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions can preserve a function of amino acids 17-25 and/or 31-39. In some instance, a carrier has a naturally occurring sequence at 17-25 and/or 31-39. In such instances, amino acids 17-25 of a carrier can have the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 160, and/or amino acids 31-39 of the carrier can have the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 163. The function of amino acids 17- \\n\\n 25 and 31-39 can be apical to basal transport. Such function can be determined as described elsewhere herein, e.g., by generating carriers comprising N-terminal truncations at such residues and compare to the apical to basal transport capabilities of these carrier to those that do not have an N-terminal truncation (see, e.g., EXAMPLES 5 and 6). Exemplary carriers comprising such regions and being capable of apical to supranuclear and/or basal transport can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of amino acid residues 1-187, 1-206, 1-245, 1-251, 1-266, and 1-386 of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. In such cases, a carrier can consist of the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 131-136. </p> [0237] In some instances, a carrier uses an additional domain to access supranuclear and/or basal compartment. Such domain can have a consensus sequence of amino acid residues 152-187 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) or of amino acid residues of positions 152-187 of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-120. The function of this domain can be to access supranuclear regions within an epithelial cell, reach basal compartments within an epithelial cell, and/or for co-localization of the carrier with elements of the trans-Golgi network such as coating protein I (COP I). </p> [0238] For example, carriers such as Cholix<sup>187</sup> or Cholix<sup>206</sup>, e.g., carriers with sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 136 and 131, respectively, which include such supranuclear and basal targeting region are capable of accessing supranuclear regions and basal compartments within an epithelial cell, whereas a carrier without such domain, such as a Cholix<sup>151</sup> (e.g., SEQ ID NO:</p>139) remains at the apical side of the epithelial cell and does not significantly access </p>supranuclear regions or basal compartments (see, e.g., EXAMPLE 6). </p> [0239] It is believed that sequence of amino acid residues 170-176 of SEQ ID NO: 130 (e.g.,“TRPEHNI,” SEQ ID NO: 161) may be of particular relevance for a carrier to access such supranuclear and basal compartments and co-localize with COPI. </p> [0240] Hence, in some instances, a carrier comprises a supranuclear and basal targeting domain, or consensus sequence of amino acid residues 170-176 of Formula I (SEQ ID NO: 130), or SEQ ID NO: 161 (corresponding to amino acid residues 170-176 of SEQ ID NO: 1). Such carrier can also include a TMEM132A interacting domain as described above. </p> [0241] The supranuclear and basal targeting domain is one that can have minimal sequence variations. As such, a carrier herein can comprise a supranuclear and basal targeting domain that has amino acid residues of naturally occurring polypeptides such as those with SEQ ID NOs: 3- 120, or can comprise only up to 1, 2, or 3, amino acid residues that are substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions relative to the residues of naturally occurring polypeptides such as those with SEQ ID NOs: 3-120. \\n\\n [0242] Exemplary carriers comprising a supranuclear targeting domain are Cholix<sup>187</sup>, Cholix<sup>206</sup>, Cholix<sup>245</sup>, Cholix<sup>251</sup>, Cholix<sup>266</sup> and Cholix<sup>386</sup>. In some instances, a carrier is one having amino acid residues 1-187, 1-206, 1-245, 1-251, 1-266, or 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> 3. Transcytosis Domain </p> [0243] In some instances, a carrier comprises a transcytosis domain. Such domain preferably can include a consensus sequence of amino acid residues 188-206 of FORMULA I (SEQ ID NO: 130) or of amino acid residues of positions 188-206 of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-120. The function of amino acid residues 188-206 can be multifold and can play a role in transcytosis. The transcytosis region can allow interaction of a carrier with transport receptor like interaction partners (also referred to herein as“TRIPs”), endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC-53, also referred to herein as LMAN1), glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), and perlecan in a pH-dependent and/or sequential manner. Such interactions can allow the carrier to access basal recycling systems that release the carrier (along with any heterologous payload coupled thereto) from the basal membrane of the epithelial cell into the basolateral compartment (e.g., lamina propria). </p> [0244] Examples of carriers capable of transcytosis include Cholix derived carriers such as Cholix<sup>206</sup>, Cholix<sup>245</sup>, Cholix<sup>251</sup>, Cholix<sup>266</sup>, and Cholix<sup>386</sup>. In some instances, such carriers have an amino acid sequence of those with amino acid residues 1-206, 1-245, 1-251, 1-266, and 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 130. In some instances, such carriers have an amino acid sequence of those with amino acid residues 1-206, 1-245, 1-251, 1-266, and 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In some instances, such carriers have an amino acid sequence of those with amino acid residues 1-206, 1-245, 1- 251, 1-266, and 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 2. Examples of such carriers with function group, N- terminal methionine are provided in SEQ ID NO: 131 - SEQ ID NO: 135. Such carrier (e.g., Cholix<sup>206</sup>, Cholix<sup>245</sup>, Cholix<sup>251</sup>, Cholix<sup>266</sup>, and Cholix<sup>386</sup>) can be used for rapid (e.g., at least 10 <sup>6</sup> cm/sec, 10 <sup>5</sup> cm/sec) and efficient (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) transport of a payload across an epithelial cell (see, e.g., EXAMPLE 5). </p>[0245] It is postulated that the sequence of amino acid residues 188-206 (e.g., </p>“AQKEGSRHKRWAHWHTGLA,” SEQ ID NO: 168) with its one or more histidine residues can act as a pH-switch, thereby allowing the carrier to interact with TRIPs such as TMEM132, LMAN1, GRP75, and perlecan in a sequential and/or pH-dependent manner. </p> [0246] TABLE 7 below shows additional Cholix derived polypeptide sequences described herein. </p> TABLE 7 - Additional Examples of Cholix derived Polypeptide Sequences \\n<img id=\"imgf000107_0001\" path=\"imgf000107_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901335/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000107_0001.tif\"/>\\n \\n\\n \\n<img id=\"imgf000108_0001\" path=\"imgf000108_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901305/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000108_0001.tif\"/>\\n </p>III. Heterologous Payload </p> [0247] Heterologous payloads contemplated herein can be of any nature, including therapeutic, diagnostic, and imaging. A payload can be part of a delivery construct. A delivery construct can include a carrier coupled to a heterologous payload. The payload can be directly or indirectly, covalently or non-covalently, coupled to the carrier. When covalently attached, a payload can be directly attached to a carrier or via a spacer. </p> [0248] The heterologous payload can be a small molecule, a nucleic acid, a polypeptide, a protein, a nanoparticle, or a combination thereof. </p> Therapeutic Payloads </p> [0249] In some instances, the therapeutic payload is a polypeptide such as, e.g., a cytokine, a hormone, a growth factor, a therapeutic antibody, a nucleic acid, an antigen, an enzyme, clotting factor, neurotransmitter, or a polymer. </p> [0250] Cytokines provided herein include chemokines and interleukins (also abbreviated herein as“ILs”). The interleukin can be an IL-l, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-l 1, IL-l 2, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-24, IL-25, IL-26, IL-27, IL-28, IL-29, IL-30, IL-31, IL-32, IL-33, IL-34, IL-35, IL-36, IL-37, IL-38, IL-39, or IL-40. \\n\\n [0251] In some instances, the interleukin is an IL-10 or an IL-22. The interleukin can be from any species (e.g., from a human or a rodent), and is preferably from the organism to which it is intended to administer the payload or delivery construct comprising such payload. Thus, in some instances, the interleukin is a human interleukin. An interleukin provided herein can be a precursor to a mature, secreted interleukin. Such a precursor interleukin can comprise a signal peptide sequence. For example, in some instances, a therapeutic payload can be a precursor of a mature, secreted protein. In other instances, the therapeutic payload is the secreted protein. For example, in some instances, the payload comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of SEQ ID NO 141, which is a full length, precursor of IL-22. In other instances, the payload comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of SEQ ID NO: 142, which is a secreted form of IL-22. In another example, the payload comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of SEQ ID NO 144, which is a full length, precursor of IL-10. In other instances, the payload comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of SEQ ID NO: 145, which is a secreted form of IL-10. </p> [0252] A heterologous payload can comprise an N-terminal methionine. For example, an IL-22 payload can comprise an N-terminal methionine. In such instances, the IL-22 can have a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 143. </p> [0253] In some embodiments, the therapeutic payload is an IL-22. The IL-22 can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of an amino acid sequence having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99%% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 141 or SEQ ID NO: 142, or a functional fragment thereof.

In some embodiments, the therapeutic payload comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 145. </p> [0255] Hormones provided herein can include peptide and polypeptide hormones. Such hormones can include growth hormones, e.g., human growth hormone (also referred to herein as hGH or somatotropin); pituitary hormones, e.g., chorionic gonadotropin, cosyntropin, menotropins, iorticotropin, protirelin, thyrotropin, vasopressin, lypressin; parathyroid hormones; thyroid hormones; testicular hormones; gastrointestinal hormones, e.g., gastric inhibitory polypeptide, epidermal growth factor-urogastrone, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, gastrin releasing peptide, gastrins, pentagastrin, tetragastrin, motilin, neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, \\n\\n secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sincalide; incretin hormones, e.g., glucagon-like peptide-l (GLP-l) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP); metabolic hormones, e.g., insulin; and any derivatives or fragments thereof. </p> [0256] In some embodiments, the hormone is a human growth hormone comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence having at least 80%, 85%,</p>90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 146 or 190, or a fragment thereof. </p> [0257] In some embodiments, the therapeutic payload is glucose-lowering agent. In such instances, the payload can be a GLP-l agent or a GLP-l agonist. Such agonist can Exenatide or Liraglutide. In other instances, the glucose-lowering agent can be an incretin, a glucagon proprotein, a glucagon-like peptide (e.g., other than GLP-l), a glicentin-related polypeptide, an exendin-3, an exendin-4, lixisenatide (tradenames Adlyxin®, and Lyxumia®, Sanofi), liraglutide (tradename Victoza®, Novo Nordisk A/S), semaglutide (tradename Ozempic®, Novo Nordisk A/S), albiglutide (tradename Tanzeum®, GlaxoSmithKline; GLP-l dimer fused to albumin), dulaglutide (tradename Trulicity®, Eli Lilly), a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, Tirzepatide (Eli Lilly), Dual Amylin Calcitonin Receptor Agonist DACRA-089, </p>Glargine/Lantus®, Glulisin/Apidra®, Glarine/Toujeo®, Insuman®, Detemir/Levemir®, Lispro/Humalog®/Liprolog®, Humulin®, Linjeta, SuliXen®, NN1045, Insulin plus SymlinTM, PE0139, fast-acting and short-acting insulins (e.g. Linjeta, PH20, NN1218, HinsBet), (APC-002) hydrogel, oral, inhalable, transdermal and sublingual insulins (e.g. Exubera®, Nasulin®, Afrezza®, Tregopil®, TPM 02, Capsulin, Oral-lyn®, Cobalamin®, oral insulin, ORMD-0801, NN1953, NN1954, NN1956, VIAtab, and Oshadi oral insulin). </p> [0258] In some instances, the therapeutic payload is a therapeutic antibody or a binding fragment thereof.

Spacer </p> [0262] A carrier can be coupled to a heterologous payload via a spacer. A spacer provided herein can provide steric flexibility, accurate folding, and/or proper biological activity and function of both the carrier and the payload. </p> [0263] A spacer can comprise one or more amino acid residues. In some instances, the spacer is an amino acid-based spacer. Such spacer can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of at least about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, or 100 amino acid residues. In some instances, a \\n\\n spacer comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at most about 30, 25, 20, 15, or 10 amino acid residues. In some instances, the majority (e.g., more than 90%) of these amino acid residues are glycine and/or serine residues. </p> [0264] A spacer can be a cleavable or non-cleavable spacer. In some instances, a cleavable spacer can be cleaved by an enzyme, e.g., a protease. A non-cleavable spacer may not be cleavable by such enzyme. For example, a non-cleavable spacer can be used in cases where higher systemic concentrations of a payload are an objective. </p> [0265] A spacer can comprise one or more repeats of glycine-serine oligopeptide sequences. Thus, in some instances, a carrier comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the amino acid sequences (GS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 169), (GGS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 170), (GGGS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 171), (GGGGS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 172), or (GGGGGS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 173), wherein x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15. In some cases, a spacer comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the amino acid sequence (GGGGS)<sub>X</sub> (SEQ ID NO: 174), wherein x = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. In such instances, a spacer can consist of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 amino acids. </p> [0266] Examples of spacers provided herein are those comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence having at least 50%, 75%, 90%, or 99% sequence identity to GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 175), GGGGS GGGGS GGGG (SEQ ID NO: 176), or GGGGSNLQGGLRQPR (SEQ ID NO: 177), a fragment of any of the above, or a combination of any of the above. In some instances, the spacer consists of the amino acid sequence set forth in any one or SEQ ID NO: 196 (GGGGS) or SEQ ID NO: 197 </p>(GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS) . In some instances, any of the above spacer can comprise an additional glycine or serine residue at either the N- and/or C-terminal. </p> [0267] In some embodiments, the spacer coupling a carrier to a therapeutic payload comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 50%, 75%, 90%, or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs: 175-176. </p> V. Delivery Constructs </p> [0268] Provided herein are delivery constructs (e.g., a carrier-payload complex) that can comprise a carrier coupled to a heterologous payload. A carrier can be coupled to such payload covalently or non-covalently (e.g., via ionic interactions, van der Waals interactions, p-p interactions, etc.). A carrier can be coupled directly or indirectly to a heterologous payload. </p> [0269] A heterologous payload can be coupled to an N- and/or C-terminus of a carrier. In some instances, a heterologous payload is directly and covalently coupled to a C-terminus of a carrier by forming a covalent amide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of the carrier and the N-terminal amine of the heterologous payload. In some instances, a heterologous payload is indirectly and covalently coupled to the carrier via a spacer. \\n\\n [0270] Thus, in some instances, when a carrier is covalently coupled to a payload, the delivery construct can be represented according to Formula II: C-S-P or Formula III: P-S-C, wherein C is a carrier, S is a spacer, or optionally a bond, and P is a heterologous payload. A delivery construct can further comprise one or more modifications on its N-terminus and/or C- terminus. Such a modification(s) can include an N-terminal methionine residue. Thus, Formula II and Formula III can also include an N-terminal methionine (e.g., M+C-S-P) or (e.g., M+P-S-C). </p>[0271] A carrier can be coupled to a heterologous payload via chemical/synthetic conjugation (e.g., using amide coupling reactions) or by recombinant expression in a bacterial (e.g., in E. coli) or mammalian (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)) cell as a fusion protein. </p>[0272] A delivery construct, or part thereof (e.g., the carrier and/or spacer), can be a polypeptide. The term“polypeptide,” as used herein, can include both natural and unnatural amino acids. </p> [0273] Delivery constructs provided herein can transcytose across polarized epithelial cells with a high flux rate through one or more moderate-affinity, high-capacity dynamic and/or pH- dependent interactions of the carrier with one or more transport receptor-like interaction partners (TRIPs). Such TRIPs can be elements of an endogenous trafficking pathways, and as such, can allow a carrier to transport heterologous payload across the epithelial cell barrier without impairing the barrier itself and without significantly altering (e.g., chemically/enzymatically modifying) the carrier or the payload. </p> [0274] Furthermore, interactions with TRIPs can allow a carrier to transport a payload across an intact epithelium (e.g., a polarized gut epithelium) with transport rates of at least about 10<sup>6</sup> cm/sec, 10 <sup>5</sup> cm/sec, or 10 <sup>4</sup> cm/sec. </p> [0275] In some instances, a carrier is indirectly and non-covalently coupled to a payload. In such instances, nanoparticles (e.g., liposomes, metallic nanoparticles, polymer-based </p>nanoparticles, etc.) can be loaded (e.g., on the inside and/or on the surface of the particle) with payload molecules (e.g., IL-10, IL-22, GLP-l, etc.), and Cholix derived carrier molecule(s) can be coupled to such nanoparticles (e.g., onto its surface). In some instances, a ratio of payload to carrier can be at least about 15000: 1, 10000: 1, 5000: 1, 2500: 1, 1000: 1, 500: 1, 250:1, 100: 1, 50: 1, 25: 1, 10:1, 5: 1, 2.5: 1, 1 : 1. This can allow transport of such payload-containing nanoparticles into or across polarized epithelial cells (e.g., polarized gut epithelial cells) using the Cholix derived carriers attached to the surface. In some cases, a nanoparticle can release the payload following transcytosis or intracellular delivery. In cases where the nanoparticle is transported across epithelial cells, the released payload can bind to receptors within submucosal tissue (e.g., lamina propria ) and/or can enter the systemic circulation and thus provide a certain function (e.g., a therapeutic or diagnostic function) systemically. In other cases, where a nanoparticle releases the \\n\\n payload inside an epithelial cell, the payload (e.g., a nucleic acid) may provide certain intracellular functions, e.g., production of transgenes within these cells, modulation of gene expression, etc. </p> Exemplary Delivery Constructs </p> [0276] In various embodiments, a delivery construct or carrier-payload complex comprises (a) a carrier comprising a Cholix polypeptide that does not comprise SEQ ID NO: 179, and does not consist of SEQ ID NO: 126, complexed with (b) a heterologous payload, wherein the carrier is capable of (i) transcytosing the heterologous payload across a polarized epithelial cell; or (ii) transporting the heterologous payload into the polarized epithelial cell. </p> [0277] In some embodiments, a delivery construct comprises a Cholix derived carrier comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid residues 1-386 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. </p> [0278] In some embodiments, a delivery construct comprises a Cholix derived carrier comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid residues from any one of the positions 1-40 to any one of the amino acid residues at positions 150-347 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1.

Methods of Use </p> [0290] Provided herein, in some embodiments, are delivery constructs comprising a carrier coupled to a heterologous payload. The carriers provided herein can be used to transport such payload (e.g., a therapeutic payload) to various locations inside an epithelial cell such as the apical side (e.g., an apical recycling system), the basal side, and/or supranuclear compartment(s). Delivery across a polarized gut epithelium can include delivery to submucosal compartments (e.g., lamina propria and/or other submucosal intestinal compartments) and/or systemic circulation (e.g., via the hepatic portal system). </p> A. Methods of Treatment </p> [0291] The high flux transport capacities of carriers provided herein across intact epithelial barriers (e.g., a polarized gut epithelium) can be used to deliver therapeutic and/or diagnostic payload molecules to a subject in need thereof (e.g., a human or a rodent). For example, delivery of therapeutic payload to submucosal compartments, e.g., the lamina propria , can allow for \\n\\n treatment and/or diagnosis of diseases or conditions located at and/or originated from such locations in the GI tract, whereas systemic delivery of payload can be used to provide </p>therapeutically effective concentrations in various cell(s), tissue(s), or organ(s) within an organism. </p> [0292] Diseases that can be treated using a delivery construct of this disclosure can include inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and neurological diseases, viral disease or infections, and cardiovascular disease. </p> [0293] In some instances, the inflammatory disease can include inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, bacterial sepsis, Crohn’s disease (e.g., fistulizing Crohn’s disease), ulcerative colitis (e.g., moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis or mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis), collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, ischaemic colitis, diversion colitis, Behcet\\'s syndrome, indeterminate colitis, pancreatitis, liver inflammation (e.g., a hepatitis), pouchitis, proctitis, and epithelial cell injury. </p> [0294] In some instances, the autoimmune disease can include systemic lupus </p>erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, hemolytic anemia, </p>thrombocytopenia purpura, Grave’s disease, Sjogren’s disease, dermatomyositis, Hashimoto’s disease, polymyositis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and </p>scleroderma. </p> [0295] In some instances, the cancer can include non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas (NHL), Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, carcinomas of the bladder, kidney, ovary, cervix, breast, lung, or nasopharynx cancer, malignant melanoma, rituximab resistant NHL, and leukemia. </p> [0296] In some instances, the metabolic disorder can include diabetes, diabetes as a consequence of obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, syndrome X, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, raised fasting glucose, insulin resistance, urinary albumin secretion, central obesity, hypertension, elevated </p>triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol and/or reduced HDL cholesterol, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, ketosis, hypertriglyceridemia, syndrome X, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), diabetic dyslipidemia, </p>gluconeogenesis, excess glycogenolysis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, </p>hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, renal insufficiency, renal failure, hyperphagia, muscle wasting, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic coma, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. \\n\\n [0297] In some instances, the cardiovascular disease can include vascular disease, heart disease, and stroke. </p> [0298] Other diseases and conditions that can be treated using a delivery construct of this disclosure can include growth hormone deficiency (GHD), Turner syndrome (TS), Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, idiopathic short stature, short bowel syndrome, allergy, graft-vs-host disease, anemia, disorders of hematopoietic cells, and diseases of the endocrine system or reproductive systems. </p> [0299] Furthermore, a delivery construct can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition to a subject in need thereof. A delivery construct herein can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition for increased therapeutic efficacy. For example, a delivery construct can be formulated such that it is being released at specific location(s) in or around the GI tract of a subject. In some instances, a delivery construct can be formulated to increase its biological activity for engaging immune cells in the various part in or around the GI tract, such as the ileum. </p> [0300] A delivery construct can be administered via various administration routes. In some cases, administration includes oral administration of the delivery construct. In some instances, a delivery construct is orally administered as a tablet or a capsule. </p> B. Experimental Methods </p> [0301] Methods are provided herein for transcytosis testing and evaluation of Cholix Carrier interacting proteins (e.g., TRIPs). </p> 1. Transcytosis Testing </p> [0302] The transcytosis function of an isolated delivery constructs can be tested as a function of the delivery construct’s ability to pass through an epithelial membrane (e.g., a polarized gut epithelium) via transcytosis. The delivery construct’s transcytosis activity can be tested by any method known by one of skill in the art, without limitation. In various </p>embodiments, transcytosis activity can be tested by assessing the ability of a delivery construct to enter a non-polarized cell to which it binds. In cases of a Cholix derived carrier, and without intending to be bound to any particular theory or mechanism of action, it is described herein that the transcytosis function that allows a delivery construct to pass through a polarized epithelial cell and the function to enter non-polarized cells resides in the same domain or region, i.e., amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Thus, the delivery construct’s ability to enter the cell can be assessed, for example, by detecting the physical presence of the construct in the interior of the cell. For example, the delivery construct can be labeled with, for example, a fluorescent marker, and the delivery construct exposed to the cell. Then, the cells can be washed, \\n\\n removing any delivery construct that has not entered the cell, and the amount of label remaining in the cell(s) can be determined. Detecting the label within these cells, e.g., using microscopy, indicates that the delivery construct has entered the cell. </p> [0303] The delivery construct’s transcytosis ability can be tested by assessing a delivery construct’s ability to pass through a polarized epithelial cell. For example, the delivery construct can be labeled with, for example, a fluorescent marker (e.g., RFP) and contacted to the apical membranes of a layer of epithelial cells. In another example, the delivery construct can be detected using antibodies (e.g., monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies) directed against the delivery construct, or a portion thereof such as a Cholix derived carrier or a payload. </p>Fluorescence detected on the basolateral side of the membrane formed by the epithelial cells (e.g., a basolateral chamber as illustrated in FIG.l or the lamina propria in in vivo experiments) indicates that the transcytosis capabilities of the carrier are intact. </p> [0304] In vivo transcytosis can be tested using male Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats can be housed 3-5 per cage with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and can be 225-275 g (approximately 6-8 weeks old) when placed on study. Experiments can be conducted during the light phase using a non-recovery protocol that uses continuous isoflurane anesthesia. A 4-5 cm midline abdominal incision that exposes mid-jejunum regions can be conducted. Stock solutions at 3.86xl0 <sup>5</sup> M of test articles can be prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), with 50 pL (per 250 g rat) being administered by intraluminal injection (ILI) using a 29-gauge needle. The injection site mesentery can then be marked with a permanent marker. At study termination, a 3-5 mm region that captured the marked intestine segment can be isolated and processed for microscopic assessment. In vivo experiments can be performed in accordance with the U.K. Animals </p>(Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986, the European Communities Council Directive of 1986 (86/609/EEC), and the University of Bath’s ethical review procedures. </p> 2. Evaluation of Cholix Carrier Interacting Proteins (i.e., TRIPs) </p> [0305] In order to identify Cholix interacting partners (e.g., receptors, enzymes, etc.) and establish the vesicular compartments where they interact with Cholix polypeptides (e.g., residues 1-266 of a Cholix sequence or a truncated version thereof), a series of pull-down assays can be performed to identify potential interaction partners that can be followed by in silico associations using surface plasmon resonance, in vitro transcytosis studies using polarized Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells where genetic knockdown of specific targets can be achieved, and in vivo transcytosis studies where Cholix elements and specific receptors can be co-localized in established vesicular structures. Without being bound to any theory, it is assumed that a transcytosis process can involve elements that are normally restricted within specific vesicular elements of polarized intestinal epithelial cells but can be recruited or“hijacked” by, e.g., Cholix \\n\\n derived carriers, to leave the late endosome and avoid lysosomal degradation following release from the cell into a basolateral compartment (e.g., via apical recycling mechanisms, apical receptor-mediated exocytosis, etc.). </p> 3. Measuring co-localization of carriers with cellular proteins </p>[0306] Co-localization of a carrier or carrier-payload complex described herein with one or more cellular proteins can be determined by fluorescence microscopy. For example, a Cholix derived carrier can be applied to the apical membrane of a polarized epithelial cell(s) (e.g., Caco- 2) or to intestinal epithelial tissue. Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the update of the carrier into the cell can be determined by fluorescence microscopy, e.g., by using labeled anti- Cholix carrier antibodies or dye-labeled carriers, or by using anti-payload antibodies. Samples or tissue sections can further be stained with markers specific for cellular proteins such as Rab7, Rabl 1, e.g., as described in EXAMPLE 7. Various image analysis techniques can then be used to determine the relative position of the carrier to the cellular protein (see e.g., EXAMPLE 6). </p> EXAMPLES </p> [0307] The following examples merely illustrate the disclosure and are not intended to limit the disclosure in any way. </p> EXAMPLE 1 </p> Production of Cholix-derived Delivery Constructs </p>[0308] In this Example, the preparation of a delivery construct as a single amino acid sequence comprising a Cholix carrier sequence, a spacer sequence, and a therapeutic payload is described. </p> [0309] First, the gene of the delivery construct was amplified by PCR, incorporating restriction enzymes pairs of Ndel and EcoRI, Pstl and Pstl, Agel and EcoRI, or Pstl and EcoRI sites at two ends of the PCR products. After restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR products were cloned into an appropriate plasmid for cellular expression, which was digested with the corresponding restriction enzyme pairs. The resulting construct comprised the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 147 and was also tagged with a 6-His motif at the N-terminus of the protein to facilitate purification. The final plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing. </p> [0310] The delivery constructs were expressed as follows: E. coli BL2l(DE3) pLysS competent cells (Novagen, Madison, Wis.) were transformed using a standard heat-shock method in the presence of the appropriate plasmid to generate delivery construct expression cells, selected on ampicillin-containing media, and isolated and grown in Luria-Bertani broth (Difco; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N. J.) with antibiotic, then induced for protein expression by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD 0.6. Two \\n\\n hours following IPTG induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. Inclusion bodies were isolated following cell lysis and proteins were solubilized in the buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 6 M guanidine HC1, and 65 mM </p>dithiothreitol. Solubilized delivery construct was refolded in the presence of 0.1 M Tris, pH=7.4, 500 mM L-arginine, 0.9 mM GSSG, 2 mM EDTA. The refolded protein (SEQ ID NO: 147) was purified by Q sepharose Ion Exchange and Superdex 200 Gel Filtration chromatography </p>(Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Sweden). The purity of proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and analytic HPLC (Agilent, Inc. Palo Alto, Calif.). </p> [0311] The delivery construct was evaluated to verify the proper folding with regard to its anticipated molecular size. Following induction, expressed protein was collected from inclusion bodies. The extent of expression of the delivery construct was verified by western blot, and the apparent molecular weight was compared to the calculated mass. </p> [0312] The results demonstrated stable and efficient production of functional delivery construct in high yield and purity. </p> EXAMPLE 2 </p> In vitro Model for Assessment of Transport across Epithelial Cell Monolayers </p>[0313] This example demonstrates an in vitro model designed to evaluate the transport properties of delivery constructs described herein. </p> [0314] FIG. 1 schematically shows a setup comprising an apical chamber above the epithelial cell monolayer and a basal chamber below such epithelial cell monolayer. </p> [0315] For apical to basolateral permeability, test articles (e.g., delivery construct, payload, etc.) were added to the apical (A) side and the amount of permeation was determined on the basolateral (B) side. For basolateral to apical permeability, test articles were added to the basolateral (B) side and amount of permeation was determined on the apical (A) side. </p> [0316] Data can be expressed as permeability (P<sub>ap P</sub>) according to the following equation: P<sub>app</sub> = (dQ/dt)/ (Co*A). Q/dt is a rate of permeation, Co is initial concentration of test article, and A is the area of the monolayer. An efflux transport ratio (R<sub>e</sub>) can be calculated according to the following equation: (R<sub>e</sub>) = P<sub>app</sub>(B-A)/P<sub>app</sub>(A-B). R<sub>e</sub> &gt;2 can indicate a potential substrate for P-gp or other active efflux transporters. </p> [0317] SMI-100 or Caco-2 cells can be used to assess the transcytosis function of a carrier or delivery construct in vitro. </p> [0318] For Caco-2 cells, an ELISA assay was performed to evaluate the ability of a carrier or delivery construct to move across Caco-2 cell monolayers via transcytosis. Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37™) cells were maintained in 5% C0<sub>2</sub> at 37°C in complete media: Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium F12 (DMEM F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mM \\n\\n glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 pg of streptomycin/ml (Gibco BRL, Grand Island,</p>N. Y.). Cells were fed every 2 to 3 days with this media (designated complete medium) and passaged every 5 to 7 days. For assays, cells were seeded into 24- or 96-well plates and grown to confluence. </p> [0319] Caco-2 cells were grown as confluent monolayers on collagen-coated 0.4-mih pore size polycarbonate membrane transwell supports (Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA) and used 18-25 days after attaining a trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) of &gt;250 W·ah2 as measured using a chopstick Millicell-ERS® voltmeter (Millipore). Apical to basolateral (A B) transport of a carrier or delivery construct across these monolayer was determined by measuring the amount of transported protein at certain time points (e.g., 15, 30, and 45 minutes) after a e.g., 4.7 nM, 23.6 nM and 236 nM apical application of delivery construct at 37°C. TER </p>measurements and the extent of 10 kDa fluorescent dextran (measured using an HPLC size exclusion protocol) were used to verify monolayer barrier properties during the course of the study. The extent of transport of the delivery construct was determined by titration of collected media in the cell-based cytotoxicity assay. Transported delivery construct was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using antibodies (e.g., anti-carrier or anti-payload, such as an anti-IL-22 antibody) for capture and detection. </p> [0320] Confluent monolayers of human small intestinal tissues (SMI-100, MatTek </p>Corporation; Ashland, MA, EISA) established on cell culture inserts were allowed to stabilize for 24 h at 37°C prior to use. Only inserts having a trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) of &gt;400 W·ah<sup>2</sup> were considered to have sufficient monolayer integrity for use in studies. A secondary verification of monolayer integrity was performed by assessing suppression of 70 kD dextran transport. The chambers were washed once with transport buffer (PBS). Test molecules (e.g., delivery constructs, payloads, etc.), prepared at a concentration of 20 pg/mL, were applied to the apical surface of inserts in 100 pL volumes. Basolateral volumes of 500 pL PBS were replaced at each time point for transport studies. Each experimental condition was performed in triplicate. </p> EXAMPLE 3 </p> Carrier-mediated Transport of IL-22 across Polarized Gut Epithelial Cells </p>[0321] This example demonstrates that a carrier of SEQ ID NO: 134 can transport IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) across polarized gut epithelial cells in vitro. This example further demonstrates that the carrier with SEQ ID NO: 134 can transport biologically active IL-22 payload across polarized gut epithelial cells and to the lamina propria in vivo. </p> [0322] Transport of delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 147) across Caco-2 cell monolayers and small intestine epithelial tissue (also referred to herein as SMI-100) was tested by applying \\n\\n the delivery construct to the apical membrane of the epithelial cells, according to EXAMPLE 2 and as illustrated in FIG. 1 for apical (A) to basal (B) transport. Experiments were run in triplicates and samples from the basolateral chamber were collected at 15, 30, and 45 minutes after apical application to determine the amount of transported protein. The amount of transcytosed protein was measured using ELISA assays. </p> [0323] The data in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 shows that a carrier with SEQ ID NO: 134 when coupled to IL-22, resulted in the transportation of IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) across both Caco-2 (FIG. 2) and SMI- 100 (FIG. 3) monolayers in a time-dependent manner, and that the delivery construct resulted in about 2-3 fold more IL-22 crossing the epithelial cells when compared to an IL-22 (SEQ ID NO: 143) that was not coupled to a carrier. </p> [0324] For in vivo experiments, transcytosis was tested using male Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were housed 3-5 per cage with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and were about 225-275 g </p>(approximately 6-8 weeks old) when placed on study. Experiments were conducted during the light phase using a non-recovery protocol that uses continuous isoflurane anesthesia. A 4-5 cm midline abdominal incision that exposed mid-jejunum regions was conducted. Stock solutions at 3.86xl0 <sup>5</sup> M of delivery construct were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), with 50 pL (per 250 g rat) being administered by intraluminal injection (ILI) using a 29-gauge needle. The injection site mesentery was then marked with a permanent marker. At study termination, a 3-5 mm region that captured the marked intestine segment was isolated and processed for microscopic assessment. </p> [0325] The results of the transcytosis activity of the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO:</p>147 are shown in FIG. 4, demonstrating that significant amounts of IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) crossed an intact and polarized gut epithelium in vivo when provided as part of a delivery construct that includes a carrier derived from Cholix. This microscopy image shows </p>transportation of the IL-22 payload (SEQ ID NO: 142) from the apical site of the gut epithelium (highlighted by white arrow #1) to the basal site of the epithelial cells and into the lamina propria (3) (abbreviated as“l.p”) after luminal application of the delivery construct of SEQ ID NO: 147 to the jejunum of Wistar rats. The image further shows that the IL-22 interacted and bound to a significant extent to IL-22 receptors located on cells within the lamina propria and on the outer basal membrane of the polarized epithelium (highlighted by white arrows #2), demonstrating the IL-22 payload was biologically active after transport. IL-22 localization is indicated by white arrows and green fluorescence, blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p>[0326] Moreover, FIG. 5 shows that the delivery constructs consisting of the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 147 and SEQ ID NO: 148 were detected at the basolateral \\n\\n compartment after transcytosis. Analysis of the western blot experiments confirms that both delivery constructs were unaltered. </p> [0327] Follow-on experiments also showed that transcytosis of delivery constructs comprising a Cholix derived carrier can depend on the presence of both GRP75 (FIG. 6) and basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (HSPG) (FIG. 7) (also referred to herein as“perlecan”). FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 show that transcytosis function was significantly reduced in Caco-2 cells that lacked GRP75 (FIG. 6, i.e., Caco-2<sup>GRP75</sup> cells) and HSPG (FIG. 7, i.e., Caco-2<sup>HSPG</sup> cells), respectively. This indicates that both GRP75 and HSPG are TRIPs that a Cholix derived carrier can interact with during apical to basal transcytosis. </p> [0328] Together, these data demonstrate that the Cholix derived carriers described herein efficiently (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) transport therapeutic payload such as IL-22 across polarized epithelial layers, with significantly increased transport rates and overall transport efficiency (e.g., at least about 2-3 fold increase) compared to the payload alone. </p> EXAMPLE 4 </p> In vivo Transport Studies into Polarized Epithelial Cells using of Cholix Derived Carriers </p>[0329] This example demonstrates the capability of truncated Cholix derived carriers to transport payload into polarized epithelial cells. </p> [0330] FIG. 8 depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 154) in apical compartments (highlighted with white arrow #2) within epithelial cells 15 min after intra-luminal injection of the construct using a rat intra-luminal injection model (white arrow #1 highlights the apical surface, white arrow #3 highlights the basal membrane, and white arrow #4 highlights the lamina propria). The data demonstrates that a carrier derived from Cholix<sup>41 187</sup> (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 137) is capable of transporting payload to apical compartments of epithelial cells, but not across epithelial cells. Red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p> [0331] FIG. 9 depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 156) in apical compartments (highlighted with white arrow #2) of epithelial cells 15 min after intra-luminal injection using a rat intra-luminal injection model (white arrow #1 highlights the apical surface, white arrow #3 highlights the basal membrane, and white arrow #4 highlights the lamina propria). The data demonstrates that a carrier derived from Cholix<sup>40 205</sup> (SEQ ID NO: 138) is capable of transporting payload (e.g., hGH) to apical compartments of epithelial cells, but not across epithelial cells into the lamina propria. These data further suggest that residues 1-40 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can play a role in transcytosis but may not be required for endocytosis of a \\n\\n Cholix carrier. Red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. </p>[0332] FIG. 10A depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) in apical compartments inside epithelial cells 5 min after intra-luminal injection of the delivery construct to rat jejunum. In FIGs. 10A-10C, red fluorescence shows localization of a Cholix carrier, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining; white arrow #1 highlights the apical compartments, and white arrow #2 highlights supranuclear compartments. </p> [0333] FIG. 10B depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) 10 min after intra-luminal injection. The data demonstrate that the carrier transported the hGH payload from apical compartments to supranuclear and basal compartments over time. </p> [0334] FIG. 10C depicts fluorescence microscopic detection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) 15 min after intra-luminal injection. The data demonstrates that the carrier transported the payload from apical compartments to supranuclear and basal compartments over time. </p> [0335] These data demonstrated that Cholix derived carriers with C-terminal truncations at position 187 or 205 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and an N-terminal truncation at positions 40 or 41 of SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively, can transport payload into polarized epithelial cells. These data further suggested that the N-terminal 39 amino acids of Cholix carrier can play a role in transcytosis but are not sufficient for transport to basolateral intracellular vesicles, and that 1-187 is not sufficient for transcytosis but sufficient to transport payload into epithelial cells (e.g., into supranuclear and basal compartments). </p> EXAMPLE 5 </p> In vitro Transcytosis Function of Cholix Derived Carriers </p>[0336] This example demonstrates the in vitro apical to basal transcytosis function of various Cholix derived carriers that were coupled to human growth hormone via a spacer using recombinant expression as described above in EXAMPLE 1. </p> [0337] The following carriers were evaluated for their ability to cross polarized human small intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (TABLE 10): </p>TABLE 10 - Tested Delivery Constructs </p><img id=\"imgf000129_0001\" path=\"imgf000129_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901342/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000129_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000130_0001\" path=\"imgf000130_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901300/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000130_0001.tif\"/></p>[0338] FIGs. 11A-11B depict apical -to-basal transport of human growth hormone (hGH, SEQ ID NO: 190) alone compared to using hGH coupled to carriers. The carrier lengths are indicated by the C-terminal truncation relative to reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (i.e.,“134” indicates a carrier having the residues 1-134 of SEQ ID NO: 1). All carriers further included an N-terminal methionine. Western blotting for hGH qualitatively assessed the capacity of these proteins to undergo apical-to-basal transport across polarized monolayers of primary human small intestinal epithelial cells in vitro after 2 h. The amounts of apically-applied materials were equivalent on a molar basis for hGH content, and basal collections were concentrated ~l0-fold prior to analysis. </p>[0339] FIG. 11A shows a comparison of the apical to basal transport of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) alone relative to that measured for the delivery constructs with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 151 - SEQ ID NO: 154 and SEQ ID NO: 159 with C-terminal truncations at positions 134, 151, 187, 41-187, and 266, respectively, of SEQ ID NO: 1. The data demonstrated that Cholix carriers with C-terminal truncations at positions 134, 151, 187 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or an N-terminal truncation at 41 and a C-terminal truncation at 187 of SEQ ID NO: 1, showed significantly lower apical-to-basal transport of conjoined hGH as compared to the construct with a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 159) with a C-terminal truncation at 266 of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> [0340] FIG. 11B shows that the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NO: 155 and SEQ ID NO: 157 - SEQ ID NO: 159 including Cholix carriers with C-terminal truncations at positions 206 (SEQ ID NO: 131), 245 (SEQ ID NO: 132), 251 (SEQ ID NO: 133), and 266 (SEQ ID NO:</p>134), respectively, of SEQ ID NO: 1 demonstrated efficient apical-to-basal transport of conjoined hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146). While carriers with Cholix C-terminal truncations at positions 245 and 251 demonstrated apical-to-basal transport of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) comparable to that of the carrier with the C-terminal truncation at position 266, the carrier with a Cholix C-terminal truncation at position 206 showed a significant enhancement of apical-to- basal transport of hGH compared to the carriers with C-terminal truncations at positions 245,</p>251, and 266. </p> [0341] These results suggested that residues 1-266 of Cholix were sufficient for apical-to- basal transport, and that it can function as a transcytosis element to deliver various heterologous payloads across epithelial cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated that elements within the first 206 amino acid residues of the Cholix polypeptide consisting of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 were sufficient for the transcytosis function and thus can be used to efficiently (e.g., at \\n\\n least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) shuttle heterologous payload molecules such as therapeutic and/or diagnostic payloads across an epithelial cell layer (e.g., the gut epithelium), thereby enabling oral administration of payload that would otherwise only be administrable via parenteral administration routes (e.g., intravenously of </p>subcutaneously). </p> EXAMPLE 6 </p> In vivo Transcytosis Function of Cholix Derived Carriers </p>[0342] This example demonstrates the in vivo apical to basal transcytosis function of various Cholix derived carriers that were coupled to human growth hormone via a spacer using recombinant expression as described above in EXAMPLE 1. </p> [0343] Selected Cholix carriers shown in TABLE 10 of EXAMPLE 5 were examined for their capacity for transcytosis in vivo following ILI into rat jejunum. </p> [0344] The data obtained in these experiments showed the extent of apical to basal transport across polarized gut epithelial cells in rat jejunum of six delivery constructs, each including a different Cholix carrier. Localization of the Cholix carrier (red fluorescence) and hGH (green fluorescence) was demonstrated (FIGs. 12A-12F) by immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal anti-Cholix and monoclonal anti-hGH antibodies, respectively. White arrows indicate the apical membrane,“1-p” refers to lamina propria ,“GC” refers to goblet cells, and open arrows indicates delivery construct present in the lamina propria. </p> [0345] FIG. 12A shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 151) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 140) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146). FIG. 12 A shows that the carrier did not enable the delivery construct to enter epithelial cells, suggesting that a functional sequence fragment having amino acid residues 134-151 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can play a role in endocytosis into polarized epithelial cells (in contrast, FIG. 12B demonstrates that the carrier with SEQ ID NO: 139 enabled cellular entry of the respective delivery construct via endocytosis). </p> [0346] FIG. 12B shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 152) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 139) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12B shows that this construct did enter epithelial cells (as opposed to the construct with SEQ ID NO: 151 described in FIG. 12A) but mainly remained in apical and, to some extent, in basal vesicular pools but did not enter the lamina propria , thereby enabling delivery of payload to apical and basal compartments of an epithelial cell. </p> [0347] FIG. 12C shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 153) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 136) \\n\\n coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12C shows that this construct entered epithelial cells, reached apical and basal compartments and also reached a supra-nuclear region of the cell, yet still remained inside the epithelial cell, suggesting that the sequence fragment consisting of amino acid residues 152-187 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can allow access and delivery to supranuclear regions, as well as allow localization in basal compartments. </p> [0348] FIG. 12D shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 154) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 137) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12D shows that this construct entered epithelial cells but remained in apical compartments and did not appear to reach basal or supra-nuclear compartments. </p> [0349] FIG. 12E shows the extent of apical to basal transport 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 155) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 131) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12E shows that this construct completed the transcytosis process as indicated by delivery constructs reaching the lamina propria (see open arrow), suggesting that the sequence fragment consisting of amino acid residues 188-206 of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 can enable the carrier (and constructs comprising such carrier) to engage with basal recycling processes that allow release of the carrier or respective construct from the epithelial cell into a basolateral compartment (e.g., lamina propria). </p> [0350] FIG. 12F shows the transport across rat jejunum epithelial monolayers in vivo 15 min after intraluminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) as demonstrated by </p>immunofluorescence microscopy. FIG. 12F shows that this construct completed the transcytosis process as indicated by delivery constructs reaching the lamina propria (see open arrow). </p> [0351] Thus, these results are in line with data obtained from in vitro transcytosis experiments described in EXAMPLE 5 and demonstrated that carriers with a C-terminal truncation at any one of residues 206-266 of the Cholix sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 can rapidly (e.g., at least 10 <sup>6</sup> cm/sec, 10 <sup>5</sup> cm/sec) and efficiently (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50% of material applied to the apical surface) transport payload molecules (e.g., therapeutic proteins) across epithelial cells (e.g., across polarized gut epithelial cells of a subject). Moreover, these results showed that carriers with a C-terminal truncation at any one of residues 151-187 of the Cholix sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or an N-terminal truncation at any one of residues 1-40 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can be used to deliver various heterologous payloads into epithelial cells. \\n\\n [0352] Based on these data, the following functional Cholix sequence fragments were identified for carriers derived from the Cholix polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> TABLE 11 - Exemplary Cholix Sequence Fragments and their Function within Cholix </p> Polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 </p><img id=\"imgf000133_0001\" path=\"imgf000133_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901346/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000133_0001.tif\"/></p>EXAMPLE 7 </p> Cholix Derived Carriers Co-localize with Rablla </p>[0353] This example demonstrates that Cholix derived carriers co-localize with Ras-related protein Rabl la (Rabl la or Rabl 1). Co-localization of a carrier with Rabl la can occur on the apical side or the basal side of an epithelial cell. It was shown that co-localization of the carrier with Rabl la at the apical side of an epithelial cell can direct the carrier to apical recycling endosomes and/or into the intestinal lumen. Co-localization of the carrier with Rabl la at the basal side of an epithelial cell indicates that the carrier can utilize basal recycling mechanisms for its release from the basal cell membrane into basolateral compartments (e.g., lamina propria). </p> [0354] The co-localization of four delivery constructs with Rabl la was tested by intraluminal injection (ILI) of 50 pL of 3.86xl0 <sup>5</sup> M solutions in PBS of the four different delivery constructs. Such delivery constructs consisted of the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 152-154 and SEQ ID NO: 159. </p> [0355] FIG. 13A, FIG. 13B, and FIG. 13C show that the delivery constructs with SEQ ID NO: 154, SEQ ID NO: 152, and SEQ ID NO: 153, respectively, co-localized with Rabl la on the apical side of the epithelial cells. The data also show that the constructs with SEQ ID NO: 152 and SEQ ID NO: 154 did not significantly localize at the basal side, but remained mainly at the apical side. The construct with SEQ ID NO: 153 did localize at both the apical and basal side, however only co-localized with Rabl la at the apical side and not at the basal side (see also, sub- images 3a and 3b of FIG. 13C showing increased localization at the apical site compared to the basal site). Together, these results suggested that carriers that are not capable of apical to basal transcytosis can enter apical recycling systems within epithelial cells, as demonstrated by co- localization with Rabl la at the apical site. Measurements were carried out 15 min after \\n\\n intraluminal injection. Green fluorescence shows localization of hGH, red fluorescence shows localization of Rabl la (or Rabl 1), and blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining (experimental description identical for FIG. 13D). </p> [0356] FIG. 13D shows that the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 159 co-localized with Rabl la on the basal side but not significantly on the apical side the polarized epithelial cells.</p>This suggested that carriers capable of transcytosis can utilize the basal recycling system for their release from the epithelial cell into the lamina propria (see also, sub-images 4a and 4b of FIG. 13D showing increased localization at the apical site compared to the basal site). </p> [0357] These data demonstrated that a functional fragment of Cholix that enables basal co- localization with Rabl la to access the basal recycling system can reside at least within amino acid residues 187-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1. </p> [0358] Moreover, these data enable the rational design of carriers that can transport payloads to various locations inside an epithelial cell or across such epithelial cell. For examples, Cholix derived carriers comprising or consisting of amino acid residues 1-151, 1-187, 41-187, 41-187, 40-205 or 41-205 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 can be used for intra-epithelial payload delivery, whereas Cholix derived carriers comprising amino acid residues 1-266 of SEQ ID NO: 1 can be used to transport payload across such epithelial cell barrier and into the lamina propria. </p> EXAMPLE 8 </p> Cell Compartment Specific Protein Markers for Assessing Type and Location of Cholix </p> Carrier Interaction Partners (TRIPs) </p> [0359] This example describes epithelial cell compartment specific protein markers that were used to determine proteins that interact with Cholix derived carriers during endocytosis and/or transcytosis processed. </p> [0360] The following TABLE 12 below shows exemplary cell compartment specific protein markers used herein. For example, Cholix derived delivery constructs comprising an IL-10 as the heterologous payload were followed during experiments using either a monoclonal antibody (mAh) against IL-10 and/or a polyclonal antibody (pAb) raised against the Cholix carrier (e.g., one that comprises residues 1-266 or 1-386 of SEQ ID NO: 1). </p>TABLE 12 - Cell Compartment Specific Protein Markers </p><img id=\"imgf000134_0001\" path=\"imgf000134_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901322/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000134_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000135_0001\" path=\"imgf000135_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725901320/WO/20200514/A1/002020/09/66/95/imgf000135_0001.tif\"/></p>EXAMPLE 9 </p> In vitro Transcytosis Studies reveal Transport Receptors Interaction Partners (TRIPs) for </p> Cholix derived Carriers </p> [0361] This example demonstrates the determination of TRIPs that Cholix derived carriers interact with during transcytosis across polarized epithelial cells. This example further demonstrates critical interaction partners that can play a role in Cholix transcytosis. </p> [0362] FIGs. 14A-14D show knockout effects of K8, HSPG (perlecan), and GRP75, respectively, on the transcytosis function of a delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 150 that includes a Cholix derived carrier with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 134 coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) via a spacer which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 177. Stable cell lines of Caco-2 cells lacking the expression of specific candidate proteins K8 (Caco-2<sup>K8</sup> ), HSPG (Caco-2<sup>HSPG</sup> ), and GRP75 (Caco-2 <sup>GRP75</sup> ) were used as monolayers in vitro to verify their involvement in carrier (e.g., Cholix carriers) transcytosis via active and selective endogenous transport mechanisms. </p> [0363] Caco-2 cells, parental or K8, HSPG (perlecan), or GRP74 knockdown (KO) stable cells, were seeded at l.5xl0<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in each transwell. On day 18, 100 mΐ of PBS containing delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150) at 20 pg/ml or equal molar control hGH (SEQ ID NO:</p>190) was added onto apical side and 500 mΐ of PBS in the basal chamber. The amount of proteins \\n\\n in the basal solution after 1 hr at 37 °C was analyzed by western blotting. Blot was probed with an anti-hGH mAb. </p> [0364] FIG. 14A shows that K8 knockout does not significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). </p> [0365] FIG. 14B shows that HSPG (perlecan) knockout does significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). </p> [0366] FIG. 14C shows that GRP75 knockout does significantly reduce transcytosis function of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 150). </p> [0367] Next, the pH-dependency of the interaction between a Cholix protein and GRP75 was evaluated. FIG. 15A shows Biacore™ binding interactions (e.g., surface plasmon resonance) used to examine such pH-dependency of Cholix carrier-GRP75 interactions. To that end, biotin was coupled to the C-terminus of full-length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and subsequently attached to a surface (e.g., chip surface, plastic 96-well plate, etc.) using the biotin-streptavidin bioconjugation and incubated with purified GRP75 protein in buffer solutions at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5, respectively. Highest binding affinity was for this interaction was measured at pH 6.5. FIG. 15A shows that the affinity of the Cholix protein for GPR75 is about 20-25-fold higher at pH 6.5 compared to pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. </p> [0368] Moreover, FIG. 15B shows the pH-dependence of the interaction of a Cholix- derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 189) with the apical receptor (e.g., TMEM132), the lysosome avoidance receptors (e.g., GRP75), traffic receptor (e.g., ERGIC-53), and basal receptor (e.g., perlecan). This pH dependency of receptor interaction indicates that a Cholix-derived carrier can sequentially and dependent on its location interact with certain receptors. For example, these data show that a Cholix-derived carrier has a significantly higher affinity to endocytosis and early trafficking receptors such as apical entry receptor and lysosome avoidance receptor at pH 7.5. Once the pH drops to about 5.5, the affinity of the Cholix carrier for these early trafficking receptors decreases, while its affinity for the apical-basal trafficking receptor ERGIC-53 and the basal release protein perlecan significantly increases at that pH, allowing the Cholix carrier to “be handed off’ to trafficking and basal release receptors during the vesicular transcytosis process. </p> [0369] FIG. 16 shows significant and sequential Biacore™ binding interactions of the full- length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 with perlecan and GRP75, demonstrating that Cholix interacts with both proteins. For the binding experiment, 20 mΐ of cholix-biotin protein at 50nM was captured on Biacore SA chip surface. 60 mΐ of human perlecan (HSPG) protein at 200 nM was injected through the chip surface at the speed of 30 mΐ/min 60 mΐ of human GRP75 protein at 100 nM was then injected through the chip surface at the speed of 30 \\n\\n mΐ/min. Chip surface was regenerated by injecting 50 mΐ of lOmM Glycine at pH 1.5 to remove all bound proteins. </p> [0370] FIG. 17 shows significant and sequential Biacore™ binding interactions of the full- length Cholix protein which sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 with GRP75, perlecan, and TMEM132A, demonstrating that Cholix interacts with all three proteins. For binding </p>experiments, 20 mΐ of cholix-biotin protein at 50 nM was captured on Biacore SA chip surface.</p>30 mΐ of human GRP75 protein at 100 nM was injected through the chip surface at the speed of 30 mΐ/min 60 mΐ of a human perlecan protein at 200 nM was then injected through the chip surface at the speed of 30 mΐ/min followed by 30 mΐ of human TMEM132A protein at 200 nM. Chip surface was regenerated by injecting 50 mΐ of 10 mM Glycine at pHl .5 to remove all bound proteins. </p> [0371] These data demonstrated that GRP75 and perlecan can play a role in transcytosis function of Cholix derived carriers, and the Cholix proteins bind GRP75, perlecan, TMEM132 proteins. </p> EXAMPLE 10 </p> Cholix Derived Carriers that Transcytose across Polarized Epithelial Cells may not Colocalize with LAMP1<sup>+</sup> or Rab7<sup>+</sup> and can be Directed Away from Lysosomes during Apical to Basal Transcytosis </p> [0372] This example demonstrates that carriers derived from a Cholix polypeptide are directed away from lysosomes during transcytosis and thus do not interact with the lysosomal recycling pathway that allows the carrier to transcytose unaltered and fully functional across polarized epithelial cells. </p> [0373] FIGs. 18A-18D show the fate of human growth hormone (hGH, SEQ ID NO: 190) that was administered by intraluminal injection (ELI, luminal surface is indicated as a white arrow in FIG. 18A-FIG. 18F) into rat jejunum in vivo that was evaluated first as a potential control experiment expecting transport of hGH to lysosomes after cellular uptake. </p> [0374] FIG. 18A shows that localization of hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) 15 minutes post injection (ILI) was limited to a small population of vesicles in the apical region of epithelial cells as demonstrated by green immunofluorescence detection. </p> [0375] FIG. 18B, FIG. 18C, and FIG. 18D show that 15 min post ILI, hGH (SEQ ID NO: 190) was co-localized with lysosomal -associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, red </p>fluorescence) (FIG. 18B) and Ras-related protein (Rab7, purple fluorescence) (FIG. 18C) with about the same frequency and characteristics of resident LAMPl<sup>+</sup>, Rab7<sup>+</sup> lysosomes (FIG. 18D), indicating that hGH was directed to the lysosomal destructive (e.g., recycling) pathway shortly after uptake into the epithelial cells. \\n\\n [0376] FIG. 18E and FIG. 18F show that a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) that includes a Cholix derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) via a spacer (SEQ ID NO: 175), was directed away from the lysosomal pathway and thus did not show co-localization with either LAMP 1 (FIG. 18E) or Rab7 (FIG. 18F), thereby enabling </p>transcytosis of functional payload across polarized epithelial cells into the lamina propria. </p> [0377] FIG. 19A shows that coating protein I (COPI, red fluorescence) distribution was restricted to the luminal apical membrane and apical vesicular compartment of epithelial cells prior to luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) that includes a Cholix derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) via a spacer (SEQ ID NO: 175). In comparison, FIG. 19B shows that apical intraluminal injection (ILI, luminal surface is indicated as a white arrow in FIG. 19A-FIG. 19D) of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159), induced COPI redistribution to a supra-nuclear location, indicating co-localization of the vesicles containing both the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 159 and COPI. Blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining. Measurements in FIGs. 19A-19D were carried out 15 minutes post-ILI. </p>[0378] FIG. 19C shows that LMAN1 (green fluorescence) co-localized with COPI (red fluorescence) in the apical region (highlighted by white arrow) of polarized epithelial cells prior to injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159). </p> [0379] FIG. 19D shows that, following apical ILI (highlighted by white arrow) of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159), LMAN1 interacted and distributed with the delivery construct to the basal region of the epithelial cell, which is adjacent to the lamina propria (denoted as“1-p”). Thus, LMAN1 redistribution appears to be used by Cholix carriers to move from the apical side of the epithelial cell to a basal compartment. </p> [0380] A follow-up experiment showed that Cholix-derived carriers can utilize ERGIC proteins (e.g., ERGIC-53) to traffic from apical to basal compartments following endocytosis. </p>[0381] FIGs. 19E-19H show trafficking of a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) from apical (indicated by white arrow #1) to basal (indicated by white arrow #2) compartments in epithelial cells 5 (FIG. 19F), 10 (FIG. 19G), and 15 min (FIG. 19H) after luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to an hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) in rat jejunum. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, ERGIC receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, and localization of ER- Golgi trafficking protein complex is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co- localization of Cholix carrier, ERGIC receptor, and ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex is \\n\\n shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0382] FIG. 19E shows untreated polarized gut epithelial cells. </p> [0383] FIG. 19F shows localization and interaction of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) with ER-Golgi trafficking protein complex 5 minutes after luminal injection in apical compartment as indicated by pink fluorescence signal in apical compartments. </p> [0384] FIG. 19G shows trafficking of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) in association with ERGIG-53 to the basal membrane 10 minutes after luminal injection followed by basal release of the carrier (and construct) into the lamina propria (gold arrow). These data demonstrated that Cholix-derived carriers utilized specific interactions with ERGIC proteins to “hijack” vesicular trafficking from apical to basal compartments of a polarized epithelial cell. </p>[0385] FIG. 19H shows increased amounts of Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) present in the lamina propria 15 minutes after luminal injection. </p> [0386] FIGs. 19I-19K show that a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) utilized basal protein secretion mechanisms to traffic through a polarized epithelial cell into the lamina propria. The fluorescence microscopy images were acquired 15 min after luminal injection of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to an hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146) in rat jejunum, and showed that basal vesicles can contain Cholix carrier and ERGIC-53 receptor, Cholix carrier and basal secretion protein, or all three of Cholix carrier, ERGIC-53 receptor, and basal secretion protein. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence (using an anti-Cholix carrier antibody), ERGIC-53 receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, and localization of basal secretion protein is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC-53 receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and basal secretion protein is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, ERGIC-53 receptor, and basal secretion protein is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0387] FIG. 191 shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and ERGIC-53 receptor as indicated by yellow fluorescence. </p> [0388] FIG. 19J shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) and basal secretion protein as indicated by pink fluorescence. </p> [0389] FIG. 19K shows that basal compartment vesicles contained Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134), ERGIC-53 receptor, and basal secretion protein as indicated by white spots (e.g., overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). \\n\\n [0390] FIG. 20A shows the distribution of another endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi- intermediate compartment (ERGIC) element, SEC22b, in the absence of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159). In untreated (i.e., no injection of a delivery construct) tissues, SEC22b and LMAN1 extensively co-localized in the apical compartment while LMAN1 alone was separately observed close to the apical plasma membrane. In FIGs. 20A-20D, red fluorescence shows localization of LMAN1, purple fluorescence shows localization of SEC22b, green fluorescence shows localization of hGH, white arrow indicates the apical surface, and“G” indicates Goblet cells. </p> [0391] FIG. 20B shows that 5 minutes after ILI of a delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) including a Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 134) coupled to hGH (SEQ ID NO: 146), LMAN1, SEC22b, and hGH co-localized in the apical compartment but not significantly in basal compartments of epithelial cells. </p> [0392] FIG. 20C shows that 10 min post ILI, the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) and LMAN1 were observed to co-localize in the basal compartment of epithelial cells without SEC22b, confirming that LMAN1 interacted and moved with the delivery construct inside the vesicle from the apical to the basal vesicular compartment of epithelial cells. </p> [0393] FIG. 20D shows that the extent of delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 159) and LMAN1 co-localizing in the basal compartment 15 min post ILI had increased, with a significant amount of hGH reaching the lamina propria over time. </p> [0394] FIG. 20E-FIG. 20H show the same tissue sections as described above and shown in FIG. 20A-FIG. 20D but showing only LMAN1 and SEC22b signals (no hGH signal). These demonstrated the profound redistribution of LMAN1 to the basal compartment without a redistribution of SEC22b in response to apical application of a delivery (SEQ ID NO: 159).</p>These data further demonstrated that delivery constructs comprising a Cholix derived carrier can utilize endogenous Cholix trafficking pathways that allow rapid and efficient transport of payload across the gut epithelium by coupling such payload to the carrier. </p> [0395] Altogether, these data showed that Cholix-derived carriers utilized endogenous bacterial trafficking mechanisms to achieve apical to basal transcytosis, allowing such carriers and delivery constructs comprising such carriers to traffic from the intestinal lumen to the lamina propria without impairing the barrier function of a gut epithelium and without being </p>enzymatically or chemically modified during such transport. This transepithelial transport mechanisms can enable oral administration of a therapeutic delivery construct comprising a Cholix-derived carrier coupled to a therapeutic payload and transport of the therapeutic payload across intact and polarized epithelial membranes. \\n\\n EXAMPLE 11 </p> Surface model of a Cholix derived Carrier </p> [0396] This example shows structural sequence elements of a Cholix polypeptide with SEQ ID NO: 178. </p> [0397] FIGs. 21A-21E show an exemplary surface model of a Cholix derived carrier consisting of SEQ ID NO: 178 (includes amino acid residues 1-265 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and an N- terminal methionine) which was used to highlight selected regions of interest that can play a role in certain functionalities related to apical to basal transcytosis, as well as their relative position and proximity on the protein surface. Amino acid regions located within residues V<sup>1</sup> and E<sup>39</sup> are adjacent to surface exposed amino acids D<sup>150</sup>-K<sup>186</sup> and K<sup>186</sup>-L<sup>205</sup>. Specifically, L<sup>17</sup>-I<sup>25</sup> (region XI, SEQ ID NO: 160) and c<sup>170</sup>-ΐ<sup>176</sup> (region X2, SEQ ID NO: 161) coordinate to form a pocket surrounded by several negative charges. Similarly, K<sup>186</sup>-H<sup>202</sup> (region X3, SEQ ID NO: 162) coordinates with I<sup>31</sup>-E<sup>39</sup> (region X4, SEQ ID NO: 163) to form a continuous ridge structure. In addition, the surface model shows residues D<sup>135</sup>-N<sup>139</sup> (region X5, SEQ ID NO: 164), and the asparagine residues (e.g., potential glycosylation sites) highlighted in purple. </p> [0398] FIG. 21A shows the amino acid sequence of a Cholix polypeptide with SEQ ID NO: 178. FIG. 21B shows the location of regions XI, X3 and X4. FIG. 21C shows the location of regions XI and X2, as well as X3 and X4. FIG. 21D shows the location of regions XI, X2, X4 and X5. </p> [0399] This structure data shows that functional sequence fragments within the Cholix sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 can have close proximity to each other such as regions X3 and X4 and regions XI and X2. </p> EXAMPLE 12 </p> Cholix Derived Delivery Constructs Interact and/or Co-localize with Various Marker </p> Proteins During Transcytosis Using Distinct Compartments </p>[0400] This example demonstrates that Cholix derived carriers can utilize distinct compartments for trafficking into and across (e.g., via transcytosis) epithelial cells using various marker proteins (see e.g., EXAMPLE 8). These data indicates that Cholix derived carrier constructs can utilize or“hijack” specific and endogenous Cholix trafficking pathways (FIG.</p>24). The study described in this example was conducted using the Cholix derived delivery construct having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 that includes a carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) coupled to IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) via the spacer with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 176. </p> [0401] FIGs. 22A-22L illustrate a trafficking pathway analysis for a derived delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). In FIGs. 22A-22L the white arrow #1 highlights the apical \\n\\n surface, white arrow #2 highlights the basal surface, and white arrow #3 highlights the lamina propria. </p> [0402] FIG. 22A shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the EEA1 antigen in cellular locations consistent with trafficking at both the apical and basal compartments of epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in early endosome compartments. Red fluorescence shows localization of the EEA1 antigen, and the green fluorescence shows localization of IL-10. </p> [0403] FIG. 22B show that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the Rab7 (top left) predominantly in the apical compartment of epithelial cells, but with only limited co-localization in cells within the lamina propria , suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in late endosome compartments (bottom left shows white light image, and bottom right shows merged staining with DAPI staining is shown in blue, red fluorescence showing localization of the EEA1 antigen, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10). </p> [0404] FIG. 22C shows that LAMP1 was identified in large, specific vesicles consistent with mature lysosomes that were devoid of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) (white arrows, red fluorescence showing localization of the EEA1 antigen, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10). The delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149), however, co-localized with the LAMP1 antigen in cellular locations other than lysosome-like structures, consistent with vesicle trafficking at both the apical and basal compartments of epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of the Cholix derived delivery construct in late endosomal compartments. </p> [0405] FIG. 22D shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct also strongly co-localized with clathrin-coated vesicles, particularly in areas adjacent to the nucleus, and with Rabl la predominantly in the basal compartment of epithelial cells as well as in selected cells within the lamina propria. DAPI staining is shown in blue, red fluorescence shows localization of IL-10 antigen, and green fluorescence shows localization of clathrin. </p> [0406] FIG. 22E shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum as demonstrated by calnexin (red fluorescence showing localization of calnexin, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10) in a pattern adjacent to the nucleus in epithelial cells and in a large fraction of cells within the lamina propria. Specifically, the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the LMAN1 antigen appeared to re-distribute in response to carrier endocytosis and transcytosis, as shown for 5 (FIG. 22F), 10 (FIG. 22G), and 15 minutes after injection (FIG. 22H). \\n\\n [0407] FIG. 22F shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) strongly co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC-53) and the LMAN1 antigen (red fluorescence showing localization of ERGIC-53 and LMAN1, and green fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining) appeared to re-distribute in response to carrier endocytosis and transcytosis, as shown for 5 minute after injection. </p> [0408] FIG. 22G shows the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct co-localized with LMAN1 antigen 10 minutes after injection. The data show significant localization of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) in the lamina propria. </p> [0409] FIG. 22H shows the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) construct co-localized with LMAN1 antigen 15 minutes after injection. The data showed significant localization of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) in the lamina propria. </p> [0410] FIG. 221 shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) did not co-localize with the low levels of giantin present in epithelial cells (red fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, and green fluorescence showing localization giantin, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining). Some giantin co-localized with the construct in a subset of cells present in the lamina propria , suggesting that the Cholix derived carrier did not localize with the Golgi compartment. </p>[0411] FIG. 22 J shows that the 58K antigen localized in epithelial cells at a site apical to the nucleus and the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) showed some co-localization (red fluorescence showing localization of IL-10, and green fluorescence showing localization 58K Golgi antigen, blue fluorescence shows DAPI staining) with this protein in a manner that suggests a brief movement through this compartment. No 58K antigen was observed in cells within the lamina propria. </p> [0412] FIG. 22K shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149, top left, IL-10 localization) showed some level of co-localization with the TGN38 antigen (top right), which showed a cellular distribution that was restricted to the apical side of nuclei in epithelial cells and adjacent to the nucleus in a few cells within the lamina propria. Bottom left image shows a white light image and bottom right shows a merge (overlay) with IL-10 (red), TGN38 (green), and DAPI signal (blue fluorescence). </p> [0413] FIG. 22L shows that the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) (IL-10 localization shown by green fluorescence, top right) strongly co-localized with Rabl la (top left, localization shown by red fluorescence) predominantly in the basal compartment of epithelial cells and in selected cells within the lamina propria. Bottom left image shows a white light image and bottom right shows a merge (overlay) with IL-10 (green), Rabl la (red), and DAPI signal (blue fluorescence). \\n\\n [0414] FIGs. 23A-23C show microscopy images demonstrating transcytosis of an IL-10 across polarized gut epithelial cells in Wistar rats at various time points following luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) included a carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 coupled to an IL-10 payload having the amino acid set forth in SEQ ID NO: 145 via a spacer having an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 176. Green fluorescence indicates the presence of IL-10 (via staining with an anti-IL-lO antibody). Blue fluorescence indicates DAPI staining, which labels DNA, and red fluorescence indicates the presence of CK-8 (cytokeratin-8) with which a Cholix-derived carrier can co-localize (e.g., in a supranuclear region of an epithelial cell) during transcytosis. The white arrows #1 highlight the apical membrane of the epithelial cells, and the white arrows #2 highlight the basal membrane of the epithelial cells. </p>[0415] FIG. 23A demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 one minute after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data showed that transport of an IL-10 payload from the apical to the basal site and into the lamina propria occurred as early as 1 minute after application of the delivery construct. White arrow #3 indicates the presence of IL-10 in the lamina propria. </p> [0416] FIG. 23B demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 five minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data showed an increased amount of transported IL-10 payload that was present in the lamina propria (see e.g., white arrows #3) 5 minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct. </p> [0417] FIG. 23C demonstrates the extent of transcytosis of IL-10 ten minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct with the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 149 to rat jejunum. The data showed an even higher amount of transported IL-10 payload that was present in the lamina propria (see e.g., white arrows #3) 10 minutes after luminal application of the delivery construct. </p> [0418] Additional trafficking experiments utilizing fluorescence microscopy have been conducted to shed light on the transcytosis mechanism of the Cholix carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 that is included in the delivery construct with SEQ ID NO: 149. </p> [0419] FIGs. 23D-23F show apical endocytosis and early trafficking of the Cholix carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 in epithelial cells 1 min after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) comprising the Cholix carrier with SEQ ID NO: 135 coupled to an IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) in rat jejunum. The data showed that Cholix-derived carriers avoid the lysosomal destruction pathway by interacting with lysosome avoidance receptors. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, apical entry receptor (e.g., TMEM132) localization \\n\\n is shown by red fluorescence; and localization of lysosome avoidance receptors is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and apical entry receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, apical entry receptor, and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p> [0420] FIG. 23D shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) at the apical membrane (indicated by white arrow #1) of a polarized epithelial cell. Basal membrane is indicated by white arrow #2 and the lamina propria is indicated by white arrow #3. </p> [0421] FIG. 23E shows interaction of Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) with apical entry receptor (e.g., TMEM132) as indicated by yellow fluorescence at and around the apical membrane. </p> [0422] FIG. 23F shows that Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135), apical entry receptor, and lysosome avoidance receptor are in close proximity at the apical membrane as shown by white spots (e.g., overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence) indicated by the white arrow. It is assumed that the lysosome avoidance receptor can approach a Cholix carrier-apical entry receptor complex, followed by dissociation of the Cholix carrier with the apical entry receptor and association of the Cholix carrier with lysosome avoidance receptor due to changes in the pH environment and the pH-dependency of these Cholix carrier-receptor interaction as shown, e.g., in FIG. 15B. </p> [0423] FIGs. 23G-23H show trafficking of a Choli carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) from apical to supranuclear compartments in epithelial cells 5 and 15 min after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149) comprising a Cholix-derived carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) coupled to an IL-10 (SEQ ID NO: 145) in rat jejunum. Cholix carrier localization is shown by green fluorescence, ERGIC receptor localization is shown by red fluorescence, apical entry receptor (e.g., TMEM132) localization is shown by orange fluorescence; and localization of lysosome avoidance receptors is shown by purple fluorescence; thus interaction of Cholix carrier and ERGIC receptor is shown by yellow fluorescence, interaction of Cholix carrier and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by pink fluorescence, and interaction and/or co-localization of Cholix carrier, apical entry receptor, and lysosome avoidance receptor is shown by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence). DAPI staining is indicated by blue fluorescence. </p>[0424] FIG. 23G shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) in a polarized gut epithelial cell 5 minutes after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). The data showed that, following apical receptor-mediated endocytosis, the Cholix carrier formed complexes with a lysosome avoidance receptor and apical entry receptor close to the apical \\n\\n membrane (indicated by white spots (overlay of green, red, and purple fluorescence) and highlighted by white arrow) and also started interacting with ERGIC receptor as demonstrated by yellow fluorescence (and the yellow arrow) slightly closer to supranuclear regions within the cell. </p> [0425] FIG. 23H shows localization of the Cholix carrier (SEQ ID NO: 135) in a polarized gut epithelial cell 15 minutes after luminal injection of the delivery construct (SEQ ID NO: 149). The data showed that the carrier moved from apical to supranuclear compartments while associated with ERGIC (see yellow arrow), wherein the yellow fluorescence intensity is increased compared to 5 minutes post-injection, indicating increased Cholix carrier movement from apical to supranuclear regions over time. The data further showed localization of Cholix carrier at the basal membrane and in the lamina propria (gold arrows). </p> [0426] Together, these data demonstrated that Cholix derived carriers can utilize </p>endogenous Cholix trafficking pathways to transcytose across polarized epithelial cells and thus can be used to rapidly and efficiently transport payload (e.g., therapeutic proteins such as interleukins) across epithelial cell barriers without impairing the biological activity of such payload. </p> EXAMPLE 13 </p> Transport of anti-TNFa agents across Epithelial Cell layers </p>[0427] This example shows the Cholix polypeptide derived carrier can transport anti-TNFa agents across intact epithelial cell layers. </p> [0428] The delivery constructs are tested for intestinal epithelial transport as follows: wild- type rats (Sprague Dawley®, -200 - 250 grams, - 6 weeks old, purchased from Charles River) are fasted overnight to clear intestines; prepare microfuge tubes containing 4% formaldehyde, tubes for tissue preservation, microfuge tubes for blood collection, microfuge tubes for serum collection, PBS, and test article; animals are prepped for experiment (anesthetize animals with Isoflorane, and shave abdomen); prepare injections for each animal (each animal receives 4 injections (2 x jejunum and 2 x colon); opened the abdominal cavity, located and marked sites of injection with distinguishing colors; slowly inject test article into lumen (injection occurs at 10 minutes in colon and 40 minutes in jejunum) and animals receive 35 pg of protein per injection at concentration of 1 pg/pL; animals are euthanized at 50 minutes; terminal blood is collected via cardiac puncture; remove jejunum and colon and placed on plastic-lined work surface; flush contents of jejunum and colon using PBS and discarded; excise 1 cm length of intestine from injection site; cut the excised tissue in half, and place 1 section into 4% formaldehyde. The remaining tissue is then sliced lengthwise and immediately placed in microfuge tube and frozen. This process can be repeated for all injection sites. Remove liver (~lcm<sup>3</sup>) and divide into 2 \\n\\n pieces. Place 1 section of liver in formaldehyde and the second for immediate frozen storage. Intestinal, liver &amp; blood serum samples are collected at 40 min termination. Centrifuge blood samples and transfer serum to container for storage. Samples arr transported on dry-ice and stored at -80°C. The dosing strategy was as follows: Chx<sup>386</sup>-anti-TNFa 100 mί, 490 pmol / 98 pg (4.9 uM); Chx<sup>415</sup>-anti-TNFa 100 pL, 490 pmol / 99.5 pg (4.9 uM); anti-TNFa 100 pL, 490 pmol / 76 pg (4.9 uM). </p> [0429] Bioanalytical analysis of the intestinal epithelial transport of the Cholix-antiTNF-a constructs are performed using a mouse IgGl ELISA kit (abeam®, Cat# ab 133045) as follows: tissue samples are obtained from Brains On-line; 300 pL assay buffer IX is added to each tube containing tissue sample; tissue is removed from the assay buffer and placed on sterile, clean cell culture lid plate; intestinal samples are gently scrapped with a cell scrapper being careful to avoid collection of the mesentery; liver samples are treated in a similar manner with additional maceration and homogenization; the resulting cellular homogenate is transferred back into the original tube; remaining tissue samples and the work area are rinsed with 100 pL buffer (2x); cellular homogenate solution is centrifuged at maximum force for 5 minutes; supernatant is applied to ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Remaining supernatant is stored at -20°C for later use. </p> [0430] FIG. 25 shows that both a Cholix<sup>386</sup> derived carrier (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 135 or 180) and a Cholix<sup>415</sup> derived carrier (e.g., comprising residues 1-415 of SEQ ID NO: 1) transport an anti-TNFa agent (e.g., an anti-TNFa antibody or functional fragment thereof) across intestinal epithelial cells at 10 minutes and at 40 minutes. Moreover, a Cholix<sup>386</sup>-anti-TNFa construct transports at about 12c the rate of anti-TNF-a alone and a Cholix<sup>415</sup>-anti-TNFa transports at ~7x the rate of anti-TNF-a alone. </p> [0431] These data demonstrate that Cholix derived carriers are capable of transporting a variety of payload molecules such as anti-TNFa agent across intact and polarized epithelial cell layers. </p> EXAMPLE 14 </p> Preparation of delivery constructs comprising Exenatide </p>[0432] Exenatide (SEQ ID NO: 195) is a peptide having GLP-l-like biological activity that is stabilized by a C-terminal amine and an N-terminal H. In this Example, two non-naturally occurring isolated constructs comprising: 1) a carrier having SEQ ID NO: 194 processed to a carrier having SEQ ID NO: 192 and crosslinked to SEQ ID NO: 195 and 2) a carrier having SEQ ID NO: 191 processed to carrier having SEQ ID NO: 193 and crosslinked to SEQ ID NO: 195 were prepared and tested for intestinal epithelial transport in vivo. Carriers having SEQ ID NO: 191 and SEQ ID NO: 192 were prepared as described herein and Exenatide (SEQ ID NO: 195) \\n\\n (Cat# HOR-246) was purchased from ProSpec-Tany Technogene Ltd. PO Box 6591, East Brunswick, NJ 08816. A Pierce™ Controlled Protein-Protein Crosslinking Kit (Cat# 23456) comprising the Sulfo-SMCC Crosslinking Agent was purchased from ThermoFisher. </p>Payload and carrier activation and crosslinking: </p> [0433] Exenatide (10 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL H<sub>2</sub>0 to form a 2 mg/mL solution. Sulfo- SMCC (2 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of PBS. Immediately thereafter, 0.088 mL (~5-fold molar excess) of the Sulfo-SMCC solution was added to 1.0 mL Exenatide solution and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Nonreacted Sulfo-SMCC was removed by applying 1.0 mL of the maleimide-Exenatide reaction mixture to a desalting column equilibrated with PBS, eluting with PBS, and collecting 0.5 mL fractions. The absorbance at 280nm of each fraction was measured to locate the protein peak. Peak fractions containing most of the protein were pooled. The concentration of the pooled activated Exenatide was determined by comparing its absorbance at 280 nm with the absorbance of the original protein solution. </p> [0434] Carriers having SEQ ID NO: 193 and SEQ ID NO: 194 have a C-terminal extension comprising a TEV cleavage site flanked by two cysteine residues that form a disulfide bond and a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag. Carriers having SEQ ID NO: 193 and SEQ ID NO: 194 were purified on a HisTrap column using standard methods. 2 mg protein (200 pL of 10 mg/ml) in PBS at pH 7.4 was activated by treatment with 2 pl of 0.1M dithiothreitol and 5 mΐ of TEV protease for two hours at 30°C. Cleaved and reduced protein was applied to a l-ml HisTrap column equilibrated with PBS. The C-terminal fragment bound to the column and the activated N-terminal SEQ ID NO: 191 or SEQ ID NO: 192 product with a free cysteine near its C-terminus was collected in the flow through. </p> [0435] The maleimide-activated Exenatide and carriers (sulfhydryl-SEQ ID NO: 191 protein or sulfhydryl-SEQ ID NO: 192 protein) were mixed in equal molar amounts and then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. The purity of the SMCC-crosslinked SEQ ID NO: 192 - Exenatide complex was assessed on a Coomassie-stained SDS gel. The complex was approximately the correct molecular weight and had &gt;90% purity (FIG. 26). The crosslinked delivery construct was then stored at 4°C. </p> EXAMPLE 15 </p> In vivo Transcytosis of Exenatide Delivery Constructs </p>[0436] The delivery constructs were tested for intestinal epithelial transport as follows: wild-type Sprague Dawley® rats (-200 - 250 grams, - 6 weeks old, purchased from Charles River) were fasted overnight to clear their intestines. The following materials were prepared: microfuge tubes containing 4% formaldehyde, tubes for tissue preservation, microfuge tubes for \\n\\n blood collection, microfuge tubes for serum collection, PBS, and test article. Animals were prepped for the experiment by anesthetizing them with Isoflorane and shave their abdomens. Four injections were prepared for each animal (2 per jejunum and 2 per colon). The abdominal cavity was opened. Injection sites were located and marked with distinguishing colors. Test articles were slowly injected into the lumen over 10 minutes for the colon and 40 minutes for the jejunum. Animals received 35 pg of protein per injection at concentration of 1 pg/pL. Animals were euthanized at 50 minutes. Terminal blood was collected via cardiac puncture. The jejunum and colon were removed and placed on a plastic-lined work surface. The contents of the jejunum and colon were flushed using PBS and discarded. A 1 cm length of intestine was excised from the injection site. The excised tissue was cut in half. One section was placed into 4% </p>formaldehyde. The remaining tissue was then sliced lengthwise and immediately placed in a microfuge tube and frozen. This process was repeated for all injection sites. The liver (~lcm<sup>3</sup>) was removed and divided into 2 pieces. For storage, one section of liver was placed in formaldehyde and a second was immediately frozen. Intestinal, liver &amp; blood serum samples were collected at 40 min after injection. Blood samples were centrifuged and the resulting serum was transferred to a container for storage. Samples were transported on dry ice and stored at - 80°C. The dosing strategy was as follows: SEQ ID NO: l92-Exenatide 100 pL, 490 pmol / 29.4 pg (4.9 pM); SEQ ID NO: l9l-Exenatide 100 pL, 490 pmol / 30.9 pg (4.9 pM); SEQ ID NO: 195, 100 pL, 490 pmol/2 pg (4.9 pM). </p> [0437] Bioanalytical analysis of the intestinal epithelial transport of SEQ ID NO: 192- Exenatide, SEQ ID NO: l9l-Exenatide, and SEQ ID NO: 195 (Exenatide) was performed using an Exendin-4 ELISA kit (Phoenix Pharma, Cat# EK-070-94) as follows: tissue samples were obtained from Brains On-line; 300 pL assay buffer (IX) was added to each tube containing a tissue sample; tissue was removed from the assay buffer and placed on a sterile, clean cell culture lid plate; intestinal samples were gently scrapped with a cell scrapper, being careful to avoid collection of the mesentery; liver samples were treated in a similar manner with additional maceration and homogenization; the resulting cellular homogenate was transferred back into the original tube; remaining tissue samples and the work area were rinsed with 100 pL buffer (2x); cellular homogenate solution was centrifuged at maximum force for 5 minutes; supernatant was applied to an ELISA plate, which was processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions; remaining supernatant was stored at -20°C for later use. </p> [0438] As depicted in FIG. 27, transport of both SEQ ID NO: 192-Ex enatide and SEQ ID NO: l9l-Exenatide across intestinal epithelial cells was observed at 10 minutes and at 40 minutes. Moreover, both SEQ ID NO: l92-Exenatide and SEQ ID NO: l9l-Exenatide were transported at a higher rate than SEQ ID NO: 195 (Exenatide) alone, especially at 40 minutes. \\n\\n EXAMPLE 16 </p> Spacer length and Coupling of Payload to the N- or C-terminus of a Carrier does not </p> Significantly affect a Payload’s Biological Activity </p>[0439] This example shows that amino acid linkers of various lengths and the coupling of a heterologous payload to the N-terminus of a carrier does not significantly impact the payloads ability to bind its target when included into a delivery construct. </p> [0440] The IL-22 receptor dimerization assay was performed by seeding DiscoverX HEK293 cells and incubate the cells for 16 h (5,000 cells per well) using the shown </p>concentrations of agonist (delivery construct containing the IL-22 payload).
